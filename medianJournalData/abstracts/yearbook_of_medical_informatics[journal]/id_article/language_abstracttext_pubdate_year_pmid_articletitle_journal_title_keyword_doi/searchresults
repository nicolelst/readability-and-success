introduce and analyse current trends in Public Health and Epidemiology Informatics. PubMed search of 2020 literature on public health and epidemiology informatics was conducted and all retrieved references were reviewed by the two section editors. Then, 15 candidate best papers were selected among the 920 references. These papers were then peer-reviewed by the two section editors, two chief editors, and external reviewers, including at least two senior faculty, to allow the Editorial Committee of the 2021 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook to make an informed decision regarding the selection of the best papers. Among the 920 references retrieved from PubMed, four were suggested as best papers and the first three were finally selected. The fourth paper was excluded because of reproducibility issues. The first best paper is a very public health focused paper with health informatics and biostatistics methods applied to stratify patients within a cohort in order to identify those at risk of suicide; the second paper describes the use of a randomized design to test the likely impact of fear-based messages, with and without empowering self-management elements, on patient consultations or antibiotic requests for influenza-like illnesses. The third selected paper evaluates the perception among communities of routine use of Whole Genome Sequencing and Big Data technologies to capture more detailed and specific personal information. The findings from the three studies suggest that using Public Health and Epidemiology Informatics methods could leverage, when combined with Deep Learning, early interventions and appropriate treatments to mitigate suicide risk. Further, they also demonstrate that well informing and empowering patients could help them to be involved more in their care process. ","1":"To analyze the content of publications within the medical NLP domain in 2020. Automatic and manual preselection of publications to be reviewed, and selection of the best NLP papers of the year. Analysis of the important issues. Three best papers have been selected in 2020. We also propose an analysis of the content of the NLP publications in 2020, all topics included. The two main issues addressed in 2020 are related to the investigation of COVID-related questions and to the further adaptation and use of transformer models. Besides, the trends from the past years continue, such as diversification of languages processed and use of information from social networks. ","2":"We survey recent work in biomedical NLP on building more adaptable or generalizable models, with a focus on work dealing with electronic health record (EHR) texts, to better understand recent trends in this area and identify opportunities for future research. We searched PubMed, the Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE), the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL) anthology, the Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence (AAAI) proceedings, and Google Scholar for the years 2018-2020. We reviewed abstracts to identify the most relevant and impactful work, and manually extracted data points from each of these papers to characterize the types of methods and tasks that were studied, in which clinical domains, and current state-of-the-art results. The ubiquity of pre-trained transformers in clinical NLP research has contributed to an increase in domain adaptation and generalization-focused work that uses these models as the key component. Most recently, work has started to train biomedical transformers and to extend the fine-tuning process with additional domain adaptation techniques. We also highlight recent research in cross-lingual adaptation, as a special case of adaptation. While pre-trained transformer models have led to some large performance improvements, general domain pre-training does not always transfer adequately to the clinical domain due to its highly specialized language. There is also much work to be done in showing that the gains obtained by pre-trained transformers are beneficial in real world use cases. The amount of work in domain adaptation and transfer learning is limited by dataset availability and creating datasets for new domains is challenging. The growing body of research in languages other than English is encouraging, and more collaboration between researchers across the language divide would likely accelerate progress in non-English clinical NLP. ","3":"To summarize key contributions to current research in the field of Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) and to select best papers published in 2020. A bibliographic search using a combination of Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors and free-text terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed by a double-blind review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. After peer-review ranking, a consensus meeting between two section editors and the editorial team was organized to finally conclude on the selected four best papers. Among the 877 papers published in 2020 and returned by the search, there were four best papers selected. The first best paper describes a method for mining temporal sequences from clinical documents to infer disease trajectories and enhancing high-throughput phenotyping. The authors of the second best paper demonstrate that the generation of synthetic Electronic Health Record (EHR) data through Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) could be substantially improved by more appropriate training and evaluation criteria. The third best paper offers an efficient advance on methods to detect adverse drug events by computer-assisting expert reviewers with annotated candidate mentions in clinical documents. The large-scale data quality assessment study reported by the fourth best paper has clinical research informatics implications, in terms of the trustworthiness of inferences made from analysing electronic health records. The most significant research efforts in the CRI field are currently focusing on data science with active research in the development and evaluation of Artificial Intelligence\/Machine Learning (AI\/ML) algorithms based on ever more intensive use of real-world data and especially EHR real or synthetic data. A major lesson that the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has already taught the scientific CRI community is that timely international high-quality data-sharing and collaborative data analysis is absolutely vital to inform policy decisions. ","4":"This survey article presents a literature review of relevant publications aiming to explore whether the EU's General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) has held true during a time of crisis and the implications that arose during the COVID-19 outbreak. Based on the approach taken and the screening of the relevant articles, the results focus on three themes: a critique on GDPR; the ethics surrounding the use of digital health technologies, namely in the form of mobile applications; and the possibility of cross border transfers of said data outside of Europe. Within this context, the article reviews the arising themes, considers the use of data through mobile health applications, and discusses whether data protection may require a revision when balancing societal and personal interests. In summary, although it is clear that the GDPR has been applied through a mixed and complex experience with data handling during the pandemic, the COVID-19 pandemic has indeed shown that it was a test the GDPR was designed and prepared to undertake. The article suggests that further review and research is needed to first ensure that an understanding of the state of the art in data protection during the pandemic is maintained and second to subsequently explore and carefully create a specific framework for the ethical considerations involved. The paper echoes the literature reviewed and calls for the creation of a unified and harmonised network or database to enable the secure data sharing across borders. ","5":"Provide an overview of the emerging themes and notable papers which were published in 2020 in the field of Bioinformatics and Translational Informatics (BTI) for the International Medical Informatics Association Yearbook. A team of 16 individuals scanned the literature from the past year. Using a scoring rubric, papers were evaluated on their novelty, importance, and objective quality. 1,224 Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) terms extracted from these papers were used to identify themes and research focuses. The authors then used the scoring results to select notable papers and trends presented in this manuscript. The search phase identified 263 potential papers and central themes of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19), machine learning, and bioinformatics were examined in greater detail. When addressing a once in a centruy pandemic, scientists worldwide answered the call, with informaticians playing a critical role. Productivity and innovations reached new heights in both TBI and science, but significant research gaps remain. ","6":"To summarise the state of the art during the year 2020 in consumer health informatics and education, with a special emphasis on \"Managing Pandemics with Health Informatics - Successes and Challenges\". We conducted a systematic search of articles published in PubMed using a predefined set of queries, which identified 147 potential articles for review. These articles were screened according to topic relevance and 15 were selected for consideration of best paper candidates, which were then presented to a panel of international experts for full paper review and scoring. The top five papers were discussed in a consensus meeting. Three papers received the highest score from the expert panel, and these papers were selected to be representative papers on consumer informatics for managing pandemics in the year 2020. Bibliometrics analysis conducted on words found in abstracts of the candidate papers revealed 4 clusters of articles, where the clustering outcomes explained 77.04% of the dispersion. The first cluster composed of articles related to the use of mobile apps for video consultation and telehealth during the pandemic. The second revealed studies reporting the lived experience of healthcare workers and patients during COVID-19. The third focused on ways people used the internet to seek for health information during the pandemic and the dissemination of fake news. The last cluster composed of articles reporting the use of social listening methods (e.g., via tweet hashtags) to explore the spread of the virus around the world. The pandemic outbreak of the novel coronavirus disease (COVID-19) constitutes a grave risk to the global community and sparks a significant increase in public interest and media coverage, especially on social media. Consumers are facing a new set of challenges that were not considered before COVID-19, often finding themselves in a world that is constantly changing-blended with facts and fake information-and unable to decide what to do next. Despite most people understanding the good will behind public health policies, one must not forget it is individuals we are supporting and that their personal circumstances may affect how they perceive and comply with these policies. Consumers more than ever need help to make sense of the uncertainty and their situation and we need to help them navigate the best option in a world that is constantly evolving. ","7":"To describe the use and promise of conversational agents in digital health-including health promotion andprevention-and how they can be combined with other new technologies to provide healthcare at home. A narrative review of recent advances in technologies underpinning conversational agents and their use and potential for healthcare and improving health outcomes. By responding to written and spoken language, conversational agents present a versatile, natural user interface and have the potential to make their services and applications more widely accessible. Historically, conversational interfaces for health applications have focused mainly on mental health, but with an increase in affordable devices and the modernization of health services, conversational agents are becoming more widely deployed across the health system. We present our work on context-aware voice assistants capable of proactively engaging users and delivering health information and services. The proactive voice agents we deploy, allow us to conduct experience sampling in people's homes and to collect information about the contexts in which users are interacting with them. In this article, we describe the state-of-the-art of these and other enabling technologies for speech and conversation and discuss ongoing research efforts to develop conversational agents that \"live\" with patients and customize their service offerings around their needs. These agents can function as 'digital companions' who will send reminders about medications and appointments, proactively check in to gather self-assessments, and follow up with patients on their treatment plans. Together with an unobtrusive and continuous collection of other health data, conversational agents can provide novel and deeply personalized access to digital health care, and they will continue to become an increasingly important part of the ecosystem for future healthcare delivery. ","8":"To select, present and summarize some of the best papers in the field of Knowledge Representation and Management (KRM) published in 2020. A comprehensive and standardized review of the medical informatics literature was performed to select the most interesting papers of KRM published in 2020, based on PubMed queries. This review was conducted according to the IMIA Yearbook guidelines. Four best papers were selected among 1,175 publications. In contrast with the papers selected last year, the four best papers of 2020 demonstrated a significant focus on methods and tools for ontology curation and design. The usual KRM application domains (bioinformatics, machine learning, and electronic health records) were also represented. In 2020, ontology curation emerges as a significant topic of research interest. Bioinformatics, machine learning, and electronics health records remain significant research areas in the KRM community with various applications. Knowledge representations are key to advance machine learning by providing context and to develop novel bioinformatics metrics. As in 2019, representations serve a great variety of applications across many medical domains, with actionable results and now with growing adhesion to the open science initiative. ","9":"We examine the knowledge ecosystem of COVID-19, focusing on clinical knowledge and the role of health informatics as enabling technology. We argue for commitment to the model of a global learning health system to facilitate rapid knowledge translation supporting health care decision making in the face of emerging diseases. We frame the evolution of knowledge in the COVID-19 crisis in terms of learning theory, and present a view of what has occurred during the pandemic to rapidly derive and share knowledge as an (underdeveloped) instance of a global learning health system. We identify the key role of information technologies for electronic data capture and data sharing, computational modelling, evidence synthesis, and knowledge dissemination. We further highlight gaps in the system and barriers to full realisation of an efficient and effective global learning health system. The need for a global knowledge ecosystem supporting rapid learning from clinical practice has become more apparent than ever during the COVID-19 pandemic. Continued effort to realise the vision of a global learning health system, including establishing effective approaches to data governance and ethics to support the system, is imperative to enable continuous improvement in our clinical care. ","10":"To summarize research contributions published in 2020 in the field of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) and computerized provider order entry (CPOE), and select the best papers for the Decision Support section of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook 2021. Two bibliographic databases were searched for papers referring to clinical decision support systems. From search results, section editors established a list of candidate best papers, which were then peer-reviewed by seven external reviewers. The IMIA Yearbook editorial committee finally selected the best papers on the basis of all reviews including the section editors' evaluation. A total of 1,919 articles were retrieved. 15 best paper candidates were selected, the reviews of which resulted in the selection of two best papers. One paper reports on the use of electronic health records to support a public health response to the COVID-19 pandemic in the United States. The second paper proposes a combination of CDSS and telemedicine as a technology-based intervention to improve the outcomes of depression as part of a cluster trial. As shown by the number and the variety of works related to clinical decision support, research in the field is very active. This year's selection highlighted the application of CDSS to fight COVID-19 and a combined technology-based strategy to improve the treatment of depression. ","11":"To review the current state of research on designing and implementing clinical decision support (CDS) using four current interoperability standards: Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resources (FHIR); Substitutable Medical Applications and Reusable Technologies (SMART); Clinical Quality Language (CQL); and CDS Hooks. We conducted a review of original studies describing development of specific CDS tools or infrastructures using one of the four targeted standards, regardless of implementation stage. Citations published any time before the literature search was executed on October 21, 2020 were retrieved from PubMed. Two reviewers independently screened articles and abstracted data according to a protocol designed by team consensus. Of 290 articles identified via PubMed search, 44 were included in this study. More than three quarters were published since 2018. Forty-three (98%) used FHIR; 22 (50%) used SMART; two (5%) used CQL; and eight (18%) used CDS Hooks. Twenty-four (55%) were in the design stage, 15 (34%) in the piloting stage, and five (11%) were deployed in a real-world setting. Only 12 (27%) of the articles reported an evaluation of the technology under development. Three of the four articles describing a deployed technology reported an evaluation. Only two evaluations with randomized study components were identified. The diversity of topics and approaches identified in the literature highlights the utility of these standards. The infrequency of reported evaluations, as well as the high number of studies in the design or piloting stage, indicate that these technologies are still early in their life cycles. Informaticists will require a stronger evidence base to understand the implications of using these standards in CDS design and implementation. ","12":"To identify and highlight research papers representing noteworthy developments in signals, sensors, and imaging informatics in 2020. A broad literature search was conducted on PubMed and Scopus databases. We combined Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and keywords to construct particular queries for sensors, signals, and image informatics. We only considered papers that have been published in journals providing at least three articles in the query response. Section editors then independently reviewed the titles and abstracts of preselected papers assessed on a three-point Likert scale. Papers were rated from 1 (do not include) to 3 (should be included) for each topical area (sensors, signals, and imaging informatics) and those with an average score of 2 or above were subsequently read and assessed again by two of the three co-editors. Finally, the top 14 papers with the highest combined scores were considered based on consensus. The search for papers was executed in January 2021. After removing duplicates and conference proceedings, the query returned a set of 101, 193, and 529 papers for sensors, signals, and imaging informatics, respectively. We filtered out journals that had less than three papers in the query results, reducing the number of papers to 41, 117, and 333, respectively. From these, the co-editors identified 22 candidate papers with more than 2 Likert points on average, from which 14 candidate best papers were nominated after intensive discussion. At least five external reviewers then rated the remaining papers. The four finalist papers were found using the composite rating of all external reviewers. These best papers were approved by consensus of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook editorial board. Sensors, signals, and imaging informatics is a dynamic field of intense research. The four best papers represent advanced approaches for combining, processing, modeling, and analyzing heterogeneous sensor and imaging data. The selected papers demonstrate the combination and fusion of multiple sensors and sensor networks using electrocardiogram (ECG), electroencephalogram (EEG), or photoplethysmogram (PPG) with advanced data processing, deep and machine learning techniques, and present image processing modalities beyond state-of-the-art that significantly support and further improve medical decision making. ","13":"In this synopsis, we give an overview of recent research and propose a selection of best papers published in 2020 in the field of Clinical Information Systems (CIS). As CIS section editors, we annually apply a systematic process to retrieve articles for the International Medical Informatics Association Yearbook of Medical Informatics. For seven years now, we use the same query to find relevant publications in the CIS field. Each year we retrieve more than 2,400 papers which we categorize in a multi-pass review to distill a preselection of 15 candidate papers. External reviewers and yearbook editors then assess the selected candidate papers. Based on the review results, the IMIA Yearbook editorial board chooses up to four best publications for the section at a selection meeting. To get an overview of the content of the retrieved articles, we use text mining and term co-occurrence mapping techniques. We carried out the query in mid-January 2021 and retrieved a deduplicated result set of 2,787 articles from 1,135 different journals. We nominated 15 papers as candidates and finally selected four of them as the best papers in the CIS section. As in the previous years, the content analysis of the articles revealed the broad spectrum of topics covered by CIS research. Thus, this year we could observe a significant impact of COVID-19 on CIS research. The trends in CIS research, as seen in recent years, continue to be observable. What was very visible was the impact of the Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic, which has affected not only our lives but also CIS. ","14":"The year 2020 was predominated by the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic. The objective of this article is to review the areas in which clinical information systems (CIS) can be and have been utilized to support and enhance the response of healthcare systems to pandemics, focusing on COVID-19. PubMed\/MEDLINE, Google Scholar, the tables of contents of major informatics journals, and the bibliographies of articles were searched for studies pertaining to CIS, pandemics, and COVID-19 through October 2020. The most informative and detailed studies were highlighted, while many others were referenced. CIS were heavily relied upon by health systems and governmental agencies worldwide in response to COVID-19. Technology-based screening tools were developed to assist rapid case identification and appropriate triaging. Clinical care was supported by utilizing the electronic health record (EHR) to onboard frontline providers to new protocols, offer clinical decision support, and improve systems for diagnostic testing. Telehealth became the most rapidly adopted medical trend in recent history and an essential strategy for allowing safe and effective access to medical care. Artificial intelligence and machine learning algorithms were developed to enhance screening, diagnostic imaging, and predictive analytics - though evidence of improved outcomes remains limited. Geographic information systems and big data enabled real-time dashboards vital for epidemic monitoring, hospital preparedness strategies, and health policy decision making. Digital contact tracing systems were implemented to assist a labor-intensive task with the aim of curbing transmission. Large scale data sharing, effective health information exchange, and interoperability of EHRs remain challenges for the informatics community with immense clinical and academic potential. CIS must be used in combination with engaged stakeholders and operational change management in order to meaningfully improve patient outcomes. Managing a pandemic requires widespread, timely, and effective distribution of reliable information. In the past year, CIS and informaticists made prominent and influential contributions in the global response to the COVID-19 pandemic. ","15":null,"16":"Human factors and ergonomics (HF\/E) frameworks and methods are becoming embedded in the health informatics community. There is now broad recognition that health informatics tools must account for the diverse needs, characteristics, and abilities of end users, as well as their context of use. The objective of this review is to synthesize the current nature and scope of HF\/E integration into the health informatics community. Because the focus of this synthesis is on understanding the current integration of the HF\/E and health informatics research communities, we manually reviewed all manuscripts published in primary HF\/E and health informatics journals during 2020. HF\/E-focused health informatics studies included in this synthesis focused heavily on EHR customizations, specifically clinical decision support customizations and customized data displays, and on mobile health innovations. While HF\/E methods aimed to jointly improve end user safety, performance, and satisfaction, most HF\/E-focused health informatics studies measured only end user satisfaction. HF\/E-focused health informatics researchers need to identify and communicate methodological standards specific to health informatics, to better synthesize findings across resource intensive HF\/E-focused health informatics studies. Important gaps in the HF\/E design and evaluation process should be addressed in future work, including support for technology development platforms and training programs so that health informatics designers are as diverse as end users. ","17":"To summarize the recent literature and research and present a selection of the best papers published in 2020 in the field of Health Information Management (HIM) and Health Informatics. A systematic review of the literature for the IMIA Yearbook HIM section was performed by the two section editors with the help of a medical librarian. We searched bibliographic databases for HIM-related papers using both MeSH headings and keywords in titles and abstracts. A shortlist of the fifteen best candidate papers was first selected by section editors before being peer-reviewed by independent external reviewers. The three major themes of Health Information Exchange (transmitting, sharing, and accessing patient health-related data and information) (HIE), Data Quality, and Privacy and Security make up 80% of the fifteen papers, with individual papers on personal health records, information governance and the professionalism of the HIM field. Traditional HIM concerns about HIM practice and workforce as well as issues about the data in electronic health records (EHRs) including data quality, coding, health information exchange among entities within the healthcare systems and privacy and confidentiality continue to be a large part of the HIM research literature. Although there was little research applying these themes to pandemic concerns, HIM professionals have the expertise to make ccontributions to public health informatics research and this research would benefit from their involvement. ","18":"To identify gaps and challenges in health informatics and health information management during the COVID-19 pandemic. To describe solutions and offer recommendations that can address the identified gaps and challenges. A literature review of relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature published from January 2020 to December 2020 was conducted to inform the paper. The literature revealed several themes regarding health information management and health informatics challenges and gaps: information systems and information technology infrastructure; data collection, quality, and standardization; and information governance and use. These challenges and gaps were often driven by public policy and funding constraints. COVID-19 exposed complexities related to responding to a world-wide, fast moving, quickly spreading novel virus. Longstanding gaps and ongoing challenges in the local, national, and global health and public health information systems and data infrastructure must be addressed before we are faced with another global pandemic. ","19":"To summarize significant research contributions on managing pandemics with health informatics published in 2020. An extensive search using PubMed and Scopus was conducted to identify peer-reviewed articles published in 2020 that examined health informatics systems used during the global COVID-19 pandemic. The selection process comprised three steps: 1) 15 candidate best papers were first selected by the two section editors; 2) external reviewers from internationally renowned research teams reviewed each candidate best paper; and 3) the final selection of three best papers was conducted by the editorial committee of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook. Selected best papers represent the important and diverse ways that health informatics supported clinical and public health responses to the global COVID-19 pandemic. Selected papers represent four groups of papers: 1) Use of analytics to screen, triage, and manage patients; 2) Use of telehealth and remote monitoring to manage patients and populations; 3) Use of EHR systems and administrative systems to manage internal operations of a hospital or health system; and 4) Use of informatics methods and systems by public health authorities to capture, store, manage, and visualize population-level data and information. Health informatics played a critical role in managing patients and populations during the COVID-19 pandemic. Health care and public health organizations both leveraged available information systems and standards to rapidly identify cases, triage infected individuals, and monitor population trends. The selected best papers represent a fraction of the body of knowledge stemming from COVID-19, most of which is focused on pandemic response. Future work will be needed to help the world recover from the pandemic and strengthen the health information infrastructure in preparation for the next pandemic. ","20":"Coronavirus Disease (COVID-19) is currently spreading exponentially around the globe. Various digital health technologies are currently being used as weapons in the fight against the pandemic in different ways by countries. The main objective of this review is to explore the role of digital health technologies in the fight against the COVID-19 pandemic and address the gaps in the use of these technologies for tackling the pandemic. We conducted a scoping review guided by the Joanna Briggs Institute guidelines. The articles were searched using electronic databases including MEDLINE (PubMed), Cochrane Library, and Hinari. In addition, Google and Google scholar were searched. Studies that focused on the application of digital health technologies on COVID-19 prevention and control were included in the review. We characterized the distribution of technological applications based on geographical locations, approaches to apply digital health technologies and main findings. The study findings from the existing literature were presented using thematic content analysis. A total of 2,601 potentially relevant studies were generated from the initial search and 22 studies were included in the final review. The review found that telemedicine was used most frequently, followed by electronic health records and other digital technologies such as artificial intelligence, big data, and the internet of things (IoT). Digital health technologies were used in multiple ways in response to the COVID-19 pandemic, including screening and management of patients, methods to minimize exposure, modelling of disease spread, and supporting overworked providers. Digital health technologies like telehealth, mHealth, electronic medical records, artificial intelligence, the internet of things, and big data\/internet were used in different ways for the prevention and control of the COVID-19 pandemic in different settings using multiple approaches. For more effective deployment of digital health tools in times of pandemics, development of a guiding policy and standard on the development, deployment, and use of digital health tools in response to a pandemic is recommended. ","21":"To introduce the 2021 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook by the editors. The editorial provides an introduction and overview to the 2021 IMIA Yearbook whose special topic is \"Managing Pandemics with Health Informatics - Successes and Challenges\". The Special Topic, the keynote paper, and survey papers are discussed. The IMIA President's statement and the IMIA dialogue with the World Health Organization are introduced. The sections' changes in the Yearbook Editorial Committee are also described. Health informatics, in the context of a global pandemic, led to the development of ways to collect, standardize, disseminate and reuse data worldwide: public health data but also information from social networks and scientific literature. Fact checking methods were mostly based on artificial intelligence and natural language processing. The pandemic also introduced new challenges for telehealth support in times of critical response. Next generation sequencing in bioinformatics helped in decoding the sequence of the virus and the development of messenger ribonucleic acid (mRNA) vaccines. The Corona Virus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic shows the need for timely, reliable, open, and globally available information to support decision making and efficiently control outbreaks. Applying Findable, Accessible, Interoperable, and Reusable (FAIR) requirements for data is a key success factor while challenging ethical issues have to be considered. ","22":"","23":"The ambient assisted living (AAL) market is rapidly becoming fundamental to the delivery of health and social care services for the elderly. Worldwide many different steps have been taken to increase the engagement of older adults with these technologies. Much of this work has focused on the development of novel digital services that increase wellbeing or tackle social challenges. The aim of the study was to identify and describe the demands for AAL-services from the perspective of older adults. We also examine the challenges and needs of the ambient assisted living market using a needs based approach. An exploratory case study was conducted with an aim to capture information about older adults' demands for AAL services. A survey was used to collect the data. The survey study respondents validated the results. The results of the study indicate that the area of AAL needs be studied from a multiple-sided market perspective. Our research suggests there is a need to describe and understand the factors that facilitate or constrain the implementation of services with focus on health and social care. There is also a need to describe and analyze the relationship between policy and practice and its effects on the AAL market. It is necessary to capture expressed demand, to identify market challenges at the macro level and to be able to understand how services should operate and serve older adults in practice. Such research is critical to the development of guidance for policy makers, suppliers and service providers. Older adults are asking for intelligent, assistive living solutions that help them to continue to live independent lives and remain socially included in their networks, associations, and communities. The elderly need services that stimulate and maintain their physical and intellectual capital. The development of innovative AAL environments is, however, a complex social process that involves the use and delivery of innovative ICT-based services. The implementation and use of AAL to support older adults involve service providers and elderly consumers. The results of the study may be of interest to policy makers, entrepreneurs, technology suppliers, service providers and health and social care organizations, who are willing to innovate and influence the development of the AAL market through their choices and decisions. ","24":"To identify the ways in which healthcare information and communication technologies can be improved to address the challenges raised by the COVID-19 pandemic. The study population included health informatics experts who had been involved with the planning, development and deployment of healthcare information and communication technologies in healthcare settings in response to the challenges presented by the COVID-19 pandemic. Data were collected via an online survey. A non-probability convenience sampling strategy was employed. Data were analyzed with content analysis. A total of 65 participants from 16 countries responded to the conducted survey. The four major themes regarding recommended improvements identified from the content analysis included: improved technology availability, improved interoperability, intuitive user interfaces and adoption of standards of care. Respondents also identified several key healthcare information and communication technologies that can help to provide better healthcare to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic, including telehealth, advanced software, electronic health records, remote work technologies (e.g., remote desktop computer access), and clinical decision support tools. Our results help to identify several important healthcare information and communication technologies, recommended by health informatics experts, which can help to provide better care to patients during the COVID-19 pandemic. The results also highlight the need for improved interoperability, intuitive user interfaces and advocating the adoption of standards of care. ","25":"To highlight the role of technology assessment in the management of the COVID-19 pandemic. An overview of existing research and evaluation approaches along with expert perspectives drawn from the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Working Group on Technology Assessment and Quality Development in Health Informatics and the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) Working Group for Assessment of Health Information Systems. Evaluation of digital health technologies for COVID-19 should be based on their technical maturity as well as the scale of implementation. For mature technologies like telehealth whose efficacy has been previously demonstrated, pragmatic, rapid evaluation using the complex systems paradigm which accounts for multiple sociotechnical factors, might be more suitable to examine their effectiveness and emerging safety concerns in new settings. New technologies, particularly those intended for use on a large scale such as digital contract tracing, will require assessment of their usability as well as performance prior to deployment, after which evaluation should shift to using a complex systems paradigm to examine the value of information provided. The success of a digital health technology is dependent on the value of information it provides relative to the sociotechnical context of the setting where it is implemented. Commitment to evaluation using the evidence-based medicine and complex systems paradigms will be critical to ensuring safe and effective use of digital health technologies for COVID-19 and future pandemics. There is an inherent tension between evaluation and the imperative to urgently deploy solutions that needs to be negotiated. ","26":"Internationally, primary care practice had to transform in response to the COVID pandemic. Informatics issues included access, privacy, and security, as well as patient concerns of equity, safety, quality, and trust. This paper describes progress and lessons learned. IMIA Primary Care Informatics Working Group members from Australia, Canada, United Kingdom and United States developed a standardised template for collection of information. The template guided a rapid literature review. We also included experiential learning from primary care and public health perspectives. All countries responded rapidly. Common themes included rapid reductions then transformation to virtual visits, pausing of non-COVID related informatics projects, all against a background of non-standardized digital development and disparate territory or state regulations and guidance. Common barriers in these four and in less-resourced countries included disparities in internet access and availability including bandwidth limitations when internet access was available, initial lack of coding standards, and fears of primary care clinicians that patients were delaying care despite the availability of televisits. Primary care clinicians were able to respond to the COVID crisis through telehealth and electronic record enabled change. However, the lack of coordinated national strategies and regulation, assurance of financial viability, and working in silos remained limitations. The potential for primary care informatics to transform current practice was highlighted. More research is needed to confirm preliminary observations and trends noted. ","27":"The emerging COVID-19 pandemic has caused one of the world's worst health disasters compounded by social confusion with misinformation, the so-called \"Infodemic\". In this paper, we discuss how open technology approaches - including data sharing, visualization, and tooling - can address the COVID-19 pandemic and infodemic. In response to the call for participation in the 2020 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook theme issue on Medical Informatics and the Pandemic, the IMIA Open Source Working Group surveyed recent works related to the use of Free\/Libre\/Open Source Software (FLOSS) for this pandemic. FLOSS health care projects including GNU Health, OpenMRS, DHIS2, and others, have responded from the early phase of this pandemic. Data related to COVID-19 have been published from health organizations all over the world. Civic Technology, and the collaborative work of FLOSS and open data groups were considered to support collective intelligence on approaches to managing the pandemic. FLOSS and open data have been effectively used to contribute to managing the COVID-19 pandemic, and open approaches to collaboration can improve trust in data. ","28":"Mobile phone-based interventions in cardiovascular disease are growing in popularity. A randomised control trial (RCT) for a novel smartphone app-based model of care, named TeleClinical Care - Cardiac (TCC-Cardiac), commenced in February 2019, targeted at patients being discharged after care for an acute coronary syndrome or episode of decompensated heart failure. The app was paired to a digital sphygmomanometer, weighing scale and a wearable fitness band, all loaned to the patient, and allowed clinicians to respond to abnormal readings. The onset of the COVID-19 pandemic necessitated several modifications to the trial in order to protect participants from potential exposure to infection. The use of TCC-Cardiac during the pandemic inspired the development of a similar model of care (TCC-COVID), targeted at patients being managed at home with a diagnosis of COVID-19. Recruitment for the TCC-Cardiac trial was terminated shortly after the World Health Organization announced COVID-19 as a global pandemic. Telephone follow-up was commenced, in order to protect patients from unnecessary exposure to hospital staff and patients. Equipment was returned or collected by a 'no-contact' method. The TCC-COVID app and model of care had similar functionality to the original TCC-Cardiac app. Participants were enrolled exclusively by remote methods. Oxygen saturation and pulse rate were measured by a pulse oximeter, and symptomatology measured by questionnaire. Measurement results were manually entered into the app and transmitted to an online server for medical staff to review. A total of 164 patients were involved in the TCC-Cardiac trial, with 102 patients involved after the onset of the pandemic. There were no hospitalisations due to COVID-19 in this cohort. The study was successfully completed, with only three participants lost to follow-up. During the pandemic, 5 of 49 (10%) of patients in the intervention arm were readmitted compared to 12 of 53 (23%) in the control arm. Also, in this period, 28 of 29 (97%) of all clinically significant alerts received by the monitoring team were managed successfully in the outpatient setting, avoiding hospitalisation. Patients found the user experience largely positive, with the average rating for the app being 4.56 out of 5. 26 patients have currently been enrolled for TCC-COVID. Recruitment is ongoing. All patients have been safely and effectively monitored, with no major adverse clinical events or technical malfunctions. Patient satisfaction has been high. The TCC-Cardiac RCT was successfully completed despite the challenges posed by COVID-19. Use of the app had an added benefit during the pandemic as participants could be monitored safely from home. The model of care inspired the development of an app with similar functionality designed for use with patients diagnosed with COVID-19. ","29":"Using participatory health informatics (PHI) to detect disease outbreaks or learn about pandemics has gained interest in recent years. However, the role of PHI in understanding and managing pandemics, citizens' role in this context, and which methods are relevant for collecting and processing data are still unclear, as is which types of data are relevant. This paper aims to clarify these issues and explore the role of PHI in managing and detecting pandemics. Through a literature review we identified studies that explore the role of PHI in detecting and managing pandemics. Studies from five databases were screened: PubMed, CINAHL (Cumulative Index to Nursing and Allied Health Literature), IEEE Xplore, ACM (Association for Computing Machinery) Digital Library, and Cochrane Library. Data from studies fulfilling the eligibility criteria were extracted and synthesized narratively. Out of 417 citations retrieved, 53 studies were included in this review. Most research focused on influenza-like illnesses or COVID-19 with at least three papers on other epidemics (Ebola, Zika or measles). The geographic scope ranged from global to concentrating on specific countries. Multiple processing and analysis methods were reported, although often missing relevant information. The majority of outcomes are reported for two application areas: crisis communication and detection of disease outbreaks. For most diseases, the small number of studies prevented reaching firm conclusions about the utility of PHI in detecting and monitoring these disease outbreaks. For others, e.g., COVID-19, social media and online search patterns corresponded to disease patterns, and detected disease outbreak earlier than conventional public health methods, thereby suggesting that PHI can contribute to disease and pandemic monitoring. ","30":"This paper describes a methodology for gathering requirements and early design of remote monitoring technology (RMT) for enhancing patient safety during pandemics using virtual care technologies. As pandemics such as COrona VIrus Disease (COVID-19) progress there is an increasing need for effective virtual care and RMT to support patient care while they are at home. The authors describe their work in conducting literature reviews by searching PubMed.gov and the grey literature for articles, and government websites with guidelines describing the signs and symptoms of COVID-19, as well as the progression of the disease. The reviews focused on identifying gaps where RMT could be applied in novel ways and formed the basis for the subsequent modelling of use cases for applying RMT described in this paper. The work was conducted in the context of a new Home of the Future laboratory which has been set up at the University of Victoria. The literature review led to the development of a number of object-oriented models for deploying RMT. This modeling is being used for a number of purposes, including for education of students in health infomatics as well as testing of new use cases for RMT with industrial collaborators and projects within the smart home of the future laboratory. Object-oriented modeling, based on analysis of gaps in the literature, was found to be a useful approach for describing, communicating and teaching about potential new uses of RMT. ","31":"Telehealth implementation is a complex systems-based endeavour. This paper compares telehealth responses to (COrona VIrus Disease 2019) COVID-19 across ten countries to identify lessons learned about the complexity of telehealth during critical response such as in response to a global pandemic. Our overall objective is to develop a health systems-based framework for telehealth implementation to support critical response. We sought responses from the members of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Telehealth Working Group (WG) on their practices and perception of telehealth practices during the times of COVID-19 pandemic in their respective countries. We then analysed their responses to identify six emerging themes that we mapped to the World Health Organization (WHO) model of health systems. Our analysis identified six emergent themes. (1) Government, legal or regulatory aspects of telehealth; (2) Increase in telehealth capacity and delivery; (3) Regulated and unregulated telehealth; (4) Changes in the uptake and perception of telemedicine; (5) Public engagement in telehealth responses to COVID-19; and (6) Implications for training and education. We discuss these themes and then use them to develop a systems framework for telehealth support in critical response. COVID-19 has introduced new challenges for telehealth support in times of critical response. Our themes and systems framework extend the WHO systems model and highlight that telemedicine usage in response to the COVID-19 pandemic is complex and multidimensional. Our systems-based framework provides guidance for telehealth implementation as part of health systems response to a global pandemic such as COVID-19.

The aim of this paper is to report the outcomes of the dialogue and discussions with more than 200 participants representing different civil society organizations (CSOs). The dialogue was held in form of a webinar. After an initial address of the WHO DG, short presentations by the panelists, and live discussions between panelists, the WHO DG and WHO representatives took place. The audience was able to post questions in written. These written discussions were saved with participants' consent and summarized in this paper. The main themes that were brought up by the audience for discussion were: (a) opportunities and challenges in general; (b) ethics and artificial intelligence; (c) digital divide; (d) education. Proposed actions included the development of a roadmap based on the lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. Decision making by policy makers needs to be evidence-based and health informatics research should be used to support decisions surrounding digital health, and we further propose next steps in the collaboration between IMIA and WHO such as future engagement in the World Health Assembly. ","34":"The current observational research literature shows extensive publication bias and contradiction. The Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics (OHDSI) initiative seeks to improve research reproducibility through open science. OHDSI has created an international federated data source of electronic health records and administrative claims that covers nearly 10% of the world's population. Using a common data model with a practical schema and extensive vocabulary mappings, data from around the world follow the identical format. OHDSI's research methods emphasize reproducibility, with a large-scale approach to addressing confounding using propensity score adjustment with extensive diagnostics; negative and positive control hypotheses to test for residual systematic error; a variety of data sources to assess consistency and generalizability; a completely open approach including protocol, software, models, parameters, and raw results so that studies can be externally verified; and the study of many hypotheses in parallel so that the operating characteristics of the methods can be assessed. OHDSI has already produced findings in areas like hypertension treatment that are being incorporated into practice, and it has produced rigorous studies of COVID-19 that have aided government agencies in their treatment decisions, that have characterized the disease extensively, that have estimated the comparative effects of treatments, and that the predict likelihood of advancing to serious complications. OHDSI practices open science and incorporates a series of methods to address reproducibility. It has produced important results in several areas, including hypertension therapy and COVID-19 research.

An extensive discussion on data quality and on obstacles to collecting data is followed by examples of successes in clinical care, contact tracing, and forecasting. Generic local forecast model development is reviewed followed by ethical consideration around pandemic data. We leave the reader with thoughts on the next inevitable outbreak and lessons learned from the COVID-19 pandemic. COVID-19 must be a lesson for the future to direct us to better planning and preparing to manage the next pandemic with health informatics.

Report from the members of the Academy's Board. Due to the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic, both Plenary meetings in 2020 had to be organized as virtual meetings. Scientific discussions, focusing on mobilizing computable biomedical knowledge and on data standards and interoperability formed major parts of these meetings. A statement on the use of informatics in pandemic situations was elaborated and sent to the World Health Organization. A panel on data standards and interoperability started its work. 34 Fellows were welcomed in the 2020 Class of Fellows so that the Academy now consists of 179 members. There was a shift from supporting to strategic activities in the Academy's work. After having achieved organizational stability, the Academy can now focus on its strategic work and so on its main objective. ","37":"The worldwide tragedy of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) pandemic vividly demonstrates just how inadequate mitigation and control of the spread of infectious diseases can be when faced with a new microorganism with unknown pathogenic effects. Responses by governments in charge of public health, and all other involved organizations, have proved largely wanting. Data infrastructure and the information and communication systems needed to deal with the pandemic have likewise not been up to the task. Nevertheless, after a year of the worldwide outbreak, hope arises from this being the first major pandemic event in history where genomic and related biosciences - relying on biomedical informatics - have been essential in decoding the viral sequence data and producing the mRNA and other biotechnologies that unexpectedly rapidly have led to investigation, design, development, and testing of useful vaccines. Medical informatics may also help support public health actions and clinical interventions - but scalability and impact will depend on overcoming ingrained human shortcomings to deal with complex socio-economic, political, and technological disruptions together with the many ethical challenges presented by pandemics. The principal goal is to review the history of biomedical information and healthcare practices related to past pandemics in order to illustrate just how exceptional and dependent on biomedical informatics are the recent scientific insights into human immune responses to viral infection, which are enabling rapid antiviral vaccine development and clinical management of severe cases - despite the many societal challenges ahead. This paper briefly reviews some of the key historical antecedents leading up to modern insights into epidemic and pandemic processes with their biomedical and healthcare information intended to guide practitioners, agencies, and the lay public in today's ongoing pandemic events. Poor scientific understanding and excessively slow learning about infectious disease processes and mitigating behaviors have stymied effective treatment until the present time. Advances in insights about immune systems, genomes, proteomes, and all the other -omes, became a reality thanks to the key sequencing technologies and biomedical informatics that enabled the Human Genome Project, and only now, 20 years later, are having an impact in ameliorating devastating zoonotic infectious pandemics, including the present SARS-CoV-2 event through unprecedently rapid vaccine development. In the future these advances will hopefully also enable more targeted prevention and treatment of disease. However, past and present shortcomings of most of the COVID-19 pandemic responses illustrate just how difficult it is to persuade enough people - and especially political leaders - to adopt societally beneficial risk-avoidance behaviors and policies, even as these become better understood.

An extensive search using PubMed\/Medline and manual review was conducted to identify the scientific contributions published in 2019 that address topics in cancer informatics. The selection process comprised three steps: (i) 15 candidate best papers were first selected by the two section editors, (ii) external reviewers from internationally renowned research teams reviewed each candidate best paper, and (iii) the final selection of two best papers was conducted by the editorial committee of the Yearbook. The two selected best papers demonstrate the clinical utility of deep learning in two important cancer domains: radiology and pathology. Cancer informatics is a broad and vigorous subfield of biomedical informatics. Applications of new and emerging computational technologies are especially notable in 2019. ","39":"Conduct a survey of the literature for advancements in cancer informatics over the last three years in three specific areas where there has been unprecedented growth: 1) digital health; 2) machine learning; and 3) precision oncology. We also highlight the ethical implications and future opportunities within each area. A search was conducted over a three-year period in two electronic databases (PubMed, Google Scholar) to identify peer-reviewed articles and conference proceedings. Search terms included variations of the following: neoplasms[MeSH], informatics[MeSH], cancer, oncology, clinical cancer informatics, medical cancer informatics. The search returned too many articles for practical review (23,994 from PubMed and 23,100 from Google Scholar). Thus, we conducted searches of key PubMed-indexed informatics journals and proceedings. We further limited our search to manuscripts that demonstrated a clear focus on clinical or translational cancer informatics. Manuscripts were then selected based on their methodological rigor, scientific impact, innovation, and contribution towards cancer informatics as a field or on their impact on cancer care and research. Key developments and opportunities in cancer informatics research in the areas of digital health, machine learning, and precision oncology were summarized. While there are numerous innovations in the field of cancer informatics to advance prevention and clinical care, considerable challenges remain related to data sharing and privacy, digital accessibility, and algorithm biases and interpretation. The implementation and application of these findings in cancer care necessitates further consideration and research. ","40":"To introduce and summarize current research in the field of Public Health and Epidemiology Informatics. PubMed searches of 2019 literature concerning public health and epidemiology informatics were conducted and the returned references were reviewed by the two section editors to select 14 candidate best papers. These papers were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers to allow the Editorial Committee a curated selection of the best papers. Among the 835 references retrieved from PubMed, two were finally selected as best papers. The first best paper leverages satellite images and deep learning to identify remote rural communities in low-income countries; the second paper describes the development of a worldwide human disease surveillance system based on near real-time news data from the GDELT project. Internet data and electronic health records are still widely used to detect and monitor disease activity. Identifying and targeting specific audiences for public health interventions is a growing subject of interest. The ever-increasing amount of data available offers endless opportunities to develop methods and tools that could assist public health surveillance and intervention belonging to the growing field of public health Data Science. The transition from proofs of concept to real world applications and adoption by health authorities remains a difficult leap to make. ","41":"This scoping review synthesizes the recent literature on precision public health and the influence of predictive models on health equity with the intent to highlight central concepts for each topic and identify research opportunities for the biomedical informatics community. Searches were conducted using PubMed for publications between 2017-01-01 and 2019-12-31. Precision public health is defined as the use of data and evidence to tailor interventions to the characteristics of a single population. It differs from precision medicine in terms of its focus on populations and the limited role of human genomics. High-resolution spatial analysis in a global health context and application of genomics to infectious organisms are areas of progress. Opportunities for informatics research include (i) the development of frameworks for measuring non-clinical concepts, such as social position, (ii) the development of methods for learning from similar populations, and (iii) the evaluation of precision public health implementations. Just as the effects of interventions can differ across populations, predictive models can perform systematically differently across subpopulations due to information bias, sampling bias, random error, and the choice of the output. Algorithm developers, professional societies, and governments can take steps to prevent and mitigate these biases. However, even if the steps to avoid bias are clear in theory, they can be very challenging to accomplish in practice. Both precision public health and predictive modelling require careful consideration in how subpopulations are defined and access to data on subpopulations can be challenging. While the theory for both topics has advanced considerably, there is much work to be done in understanding how to implement and evaluate these approaches in practice. ","42":"Analyze papers published in 2019 within the medical natural language processing (NLP) domain in order to select the best works of the field. We performed an automatic and manual pre-selection of papers to be reviewed and finally selected the best NLP papers of the year. We also propose an analysis of the content of NLP publications in 2019. Three best papers have been selected this year including the generation of synthetic record texts in Chinese, a method to identify contradictions in the literature, and the BioBERT word representation. The year 2019 was very rich and various NLP issues and topics were addressed by research teams. This shows the will and capacity of researchers to move towards robust and reproducible results. Researchers also prove to be creative in addressing original issues with relevant approaches. ","43":"We survey recent developments in medical Information Extraction (IE) as reported in the literature from the past three years. Our focus is on the fundamental methodological paradigm shift from standard Machine Learning (ML) techniques to Deep Neural Networks (DNNs). We describe applications of this new paradigm concentrating on two basic IE tasks, named entity recognition and relation extraction, for two selected semantic classes-diseases and drugs (or medications)-and relations between them. For the time period from 2017 to early 2020, we searched for relevant publications from three major scientific communities: medicine and medical informatics, natural language processing, as well as neural networks and artificial intelligence. In the past decade, the field of Natural Language Processing (NLP) has undergone a profound methodological shift from symbolic to distributed representations based on the paradigm of Deep Learning (DL). Meanwhile, this trend is, although with some delay, also reflected in the medical NLP community. In the reporting period, overwhelming experimental evidence has been gathered, as illustrated in this survey for medical IE, that DL-based approaches outperform non-DL ones by often large margins. Still, small-sized and access-limited corpora create intrinsic problems for data-greedy DL as do special linguistic phenomena of medical sublanguages that have to be overcome by adaptive learning strategies. The paradigm shift from (feature-engineered) ML to DNNs changes the fundamental methodological rules of the game for medical NLP. This change is by no means restricted to medical IE but should also deeply influence other areas of medical informatics, either NLP- or non-NLP-based. ","44":"To summarize key contributions to current research in the field of Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) and to select best papers published in 2019. A bibliographic search using a combination of MeSH descriptors and free-text terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed by a double-blind review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. After peer-review ranking, a consensus meeting between the two section editors and the editorial team was organized to finally conclude on the selected three best papers. Among the 517 papers, published in 2019, returned by the search, that were in the scope of the various areas of CRI, the full review process selected three best papers. The first best paper describes the use of a homomorphic encryption technique to enable federated analysis of real-world data while complying more easily with data protection requirements. The authors of the second best paper demonstrate the evidence value of federated data networks reporting a large real world data study related to the first line treatment for hypertension. The third best paper reports the migration of the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) adverse event reporting system database to the OMOP common data model. This work opens the combined analysis of both spontaneous reporting system and electronic health record (EHR) data for pharmacovigilance. The most significant research efforts in the CRI field are currently focusing on real world evidence generation and especially the reuse of EHR data. With the progress achieved this year in the areas of phenotyping, data integration, semantic interoperability, and data quality assessment, real world data is becoming more accessible and reusable. High quality data sets are key assets not only for large scale observational studies or for changing the way clinical trials are conducted but also for developing or evaluating artificial intelligence algorithms guiding clinical decision for more personalized care. And lastly, security and confidentiality, ethical and regulatory issues, and more generally speaking data governance are still active research areas this year. ","45":"Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) declares its scope in its name, but its content, both in terms of the clinical research it supports-and sometimes initiates-and the methods it has developed over time, reach much further than the name suggests. The goal of this review is to celebrate the extraordinary diversity of activity and of results, not as a prize-giving pageant, but in recognition of the field, the community that both serves and is sustained by it, and of its interdisciplinarity and its international dimension. Beyond personal awareness of a range of work commensurate with the author's own research, it is clear that, even with a thorough literature search, a comprehensive review is impossible. Moreover, the field has grown and subdivided to an extent that makes it very hard for one individual to be familiar with every branch or with more than a few branches in any depth. A literature survey was conducted that focused on informatics-related terms in the general biomedical and healthcare literature, and specific concerns (\"artificial intelligence\", \"data models\", \"analytics\", etc.) in the biomedical informatics (BMI) literature. In addition to a selection from the results from these searches, suggestive references within them were also considered. The substantive sections of the paper-Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and \"Big Data\" Analytics; Common Data Models, Data Quality, and Standards; Phenotyping and Cohort Discovery; Privacy: Deidentification, Distributed Computation, Blockchain; Causal Inference and Real-World Evidence-provide broad coverage of these active research areas, with, no doubt, a bias towards this reviewer's interests and preferences, landing on a number of papers that stood out in one way or another, or, alternatively, exemplified a particular line of work. CRI is thriving, not only in the familiar major centers of research, but more widely, throughout the world. This is not to pretend that the distribution is uniform, but to highlight the potential for this domain to play a prominent role in supporting progress in medicine, healthcare, and wellbeing everywhere. We conclude with the observation that CRI and its practitioners would make apt stewards of the new medical knowledge that their methods will bring forward. ","46":"Summarize recent research and select the best papers published in 2019 in the field of Bioinformatics and Translational Informatics (BTI) for the corresponding section of the International Medical Informatics Association Yearbook. A literature review was performed for retrieving from PubMed papers indexed with keywords and free terms related to BTI. Independent review allowed the section editors to select a list of 15 candidate best papers which were subsequently peer-reviewed. A final consensus meeting gathering the whole Yearbook editorial committee was organized to finally decide on the selection of the best papers. Among the 931 retrieved papers covering the various subareas of BTI, the review process selected four best papers. The first paper presents a logical modeling of cancer pathways. Using their tools, the authors are able to identify two known behaviours of tumors. The second paper describes a deep-learning approach to predicting resistance to antibiotics in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. The authors of the third paper introduce a Genomic Global Positioning System (GPS) enabling comparison of genomic data with other individuals or genomics databases while preserving privacy. The fourth paper presents a multi-omics and temporal sequence-based approach to provide a better understanding of the sequence of events leading to Alzheimer's Disease. Thanks to the normalization of open data and open science practices, research in BTI continues to develop and mature. Noteworthy achievements are sophisticated applications of leading edge machine-learning methods dedicated to personalized medicine. ","47":"Any attempt to introduce new data types in the entangled hospital infrastructure should help to unravel old knots without tangling new ones. Health data from a wide range of sources has become increasingly available. We witness an insatiable thirst for data in oncology as treatment paradigms are shifting to targeted molecular therapies. From nineteenth-century medical notes consisting entirely of narrative description to standardised forms recording physical examination and medical notes, we have nowadays moved to electronic health records (EHRs). All our analogue medical records are rendered as sequences of zeros and ones changing how we capture and share data. The challenge we face is to offload the analysis without entrusting a machine (or algorithms) to make major decisions about a diagnosis, a treatment, or a surgery, keeping the human oversight. Computers don't have judgment, they lack context. EHRs have become the latest addition to our toolset to look after patients. Moore's law and general advances in computation have contributed to make EHRs a cornerstone of Molecular Tumour Boards, presenting a detailed and unique description of a tumour and treatment options. Precision oncology, as a systematic approach matching the most accurate and effective treatment to each individual cancer patient, based on a molecular profile, is already expanding to other disease areas. ","48":"To summarise the state of the art published in 2019 in consumer health informatics and education, with a special emphasis on \"Ethics and Health Informatics\". We conducted a systematic search of articles published in PubMed using a predefined set of queries, which identified 368 potential articles for review. These articles were screened according to topic relevance and 15 were selected for consideration of best paper candidates, which were then presented to a panel of international experts for full paper review and scoring. The top five papers according to the external reviewers' ranking were discussed in a consensus meeting. Finally, the paper that received the highest score from four of the five experts was selected as the best paper on social media and ethics for patients and consumers of the year 2019. Despite using the terms \"ethics\" and \"ethical\" in the search query, we retrieved very few articles. The bibliometric analysis identified three major clusters centred on \"social\", \"health\", and \"study\". Among the top five papers, one was a review where the authors identified ethical issues across four areas at the intersection of social media and health: 1) the impact of social networking sites on the doctor-patient relationship; 2) the development of e-health platforms to deliver care; 3) the use of online data and algorithms to inform health research; and 4) the broader public health consequences of widespread social media use. The other papers highlighted ethical concerns in using social media to interact with patients at different phases of a clinical research protocol, such as recruitment phase, participant engagement, data linkage, and detection and monitoring of adverse events. Findings suggest that most users do not think that using social media for patient monitoring in clinical research, for example using Twitter for clinical trial recruitment, constitutes inappropriate surveillance or a violation of privacy. However, further research is needed to identify whether and how views on ethical concerns differed between social media platforms and across populations. ","49":"Surgical innovation (SI) can place patients at risk. We sought to explore what clinical information is readily available to patients who have been offered innovative surgical procedures, using two examples drawn from our recent experience: one a surgical technique, and the other a prosthetic material. We wanted to determine from our review the extent to which information available on the Internet might augment the medical literature and help satisfy the ethical requirements for patients to be adequately informed before they proceed with innovative surgery. A scoping review of the medical literature was performed to look for studies addressing the review aims; targeted searches on Google, YouTube, and patient websites were carried out to find readily available patient information on two chosen innovative surgical procedures. We conducted a content analysis of the selected references to determine the availability, relevance, and the utility of the published information to a layperson. Medical database searches identified 614 records, 91 were screened and only six were relevant. The Internet searches returned thousands of results; however, we limited our screening to the first five pages of results for those sources. From both types of searches, 348 references were excluded because they did not meet the inclusion criteria and 51 were included in the analysis. The findings are presented in four themes: safety and feasibility of the technique, availability and accessibility to a layperson, relevance and utility to a layperson, and commercial information. The review has shown that lay people seeking to find out more about the two innovations would get very little useful information from Google, YouTube, or patient websites. Practitioners offering SI should provide sufficient information to allow their patients to make an autonomous decision about whether to proceed. For major SI, we encourage innovators to develop a plain language statement that would be made available on the Internet to the mutual advantage of both innovators and patients. ","50":"To select, present, and summarize the best papers in the field of Knowledge Representation and Management (KRM) published in 2019. A comprehensive and standardized review of the biomedical informatics literature was performed to select the most interesting papers of KRM published in 2019, based on PubMed and ISI Web Of Knowledge queries. Four best papers were selected among 1,189 publications retrieved, following the usual International Medical Informatics Association Yearbook reviewing process. In 2019, research areas covered by pre-selected papers were represented by the design of semantic resources (methods, visualization, curation) and the application of semantic representations for the integration\/enrichment of biomedical data. Besides new ontologies and sound methodological guidance to rethink knowledge bases design, we observed large scale applications, promising results for phenotypes characterization, semantic-aware machine learning solutions for biomedical data analysis, and semantic provenance information representations for scientific reproducibility evaluation. In the KRM selection for 2019, research on knowledge representation demonstrated significant contributions both in the design and in the application of semantic resources. Semantic representations serve a great variety of applications across many medical domains, with actionable results. ","51":"To select, present, and summarize the most relevant papers published in 2018 and 2019 in the field of Ontologies and Knowledge Representation, with a particular focus on the intersection between Ontologies and Machine Learning. A comprehensive review of the medical informatics literature was performed to select the most interesting papers published in 2018 and 2019 and that document the utility of ontologies for computational analysis, including machine learning. Fifteen articles were selected for inclusion in this survey paper. The chosen articles belong to three major themes: (i) the identification of phenotypic abnormalities in electronic health record (EHR) data using the Human Phenotype Ontology ; (ii) word and node embedding algorithms to supplement natural language processing (NLP) of EHRs and other medical texts; and (iii) hybrid ontology and NLP-based approaches to extracting structured and unstructured components of EHRs. Unprecedented amounts of clinically relevant data are now available for clinical and research use. Machine learning is increasingly being applied to these data sources for predictive analytics, precision medicine, and differential diagnosis. Ontologies have become an essential component of software pipelines designed to extract, code, and analyze clinical information by machine learning algorithms. The intersection of machine learning and semantics is proving to be an innovative space in clinical research. ","52":"To summarize significant research contributions published in 2019 in the field of computerized clinical decision support and select the best papers for the Decision Support section of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook. Two bibliographic databases were searched for papers referring to clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) and computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems. From search results, section editors established a list of candidate best papers, which were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. The IMIA Yearbook editorial committee finally selected the best papers on the basis of all reviews including the section editors' evaluation. A total of 1,378 articles were retrieved. Fifteen best paper candidates were selected, the reviews of which resulted in the selection of three best papers. One paper reports on a guideline modeling approach based on clinical decision trees, both clinically interpretable and suitable for implementation in CDSSs. In another paper, authors promote the use of extended Timed Transition Diagrams in CDSSs to formalize consistently recurrent medical processes for chronic diseases management. The third paper proposes a conceptual framework and a grid for assessing the performance of predictive tools based on the critical appraisal of published evidence. As showed by the number and the variety of works related to decision support, research in the field is very active. This year's selection highlighted pragmatic works that promote transparency and trust required by decision support tools. ","53":null,"54":"To highlight noteworthy papers that are representative of 2019 developments in the fields of sensors, signals, and imaging informatics. A broad literature search was conducted in January 2020 using PubMed. Separate predefined queries were created for sensors\/signals and imaging informatics using a combination of Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and keywords. Section editors reviewed the titles and abstracts of both sets of results. Papers were assessed on a three-point Likert scale by two co-editors, rated from 3 (do not include) to 1 (should be included). Papers with an average score of 2 or less were then read by all three section editors, and the group nominated top papers based on consensus. These candidate best papers were then rated by at least six external reviewers. The query related to signals and sensors returned a set of 255 papers from 140 unique journals. The imaging informatics query returned a set of 3,262 papers from 870 unique journals. Based on titles and abstracts, the section co-editors jointly filtered the list down to 50 papers from which 15 candidate best papers were nominated after discussion. A composite rating after review determined four papers which were then approved by consensus of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook editorial board. These best papers represent different international groups and journals. The four best papers represent state-of-the-art approaches for processing, combining, and analyzing heterogeneous sensor and imaging data. These papers demonstrate the use of advanced machine learning techniques to improve comparisons between images acquired at different time points, fuse information from multiple sensors, and translate images from one modality to another. ","55":"There has been a rapid development of deep learning (DL) models for medical imaging. However, DL requires a large labeled dataset for training the models. Getting large-scale labeled data remains a challenge, and multi-center datasets suffer from heterogeneity due to patient diversity and varying imaging protocols. Domain adaptation (DA) has been developed to transfer the knowledge from a labeled data domain to a related but unlabeled domain in either image space or feature space. DA is a type of transfer learning (TL) that can improve the performance of models when applied to multiple different datasets. In this survey, we review the state-of-the-art DL-based DA methods for medical imaging. We aim to summarize recent advances, highlighting the motivation, challenges, and opportunities, and to discuss promising directions for future work in DA for medical imaging. We surveyed peer-reviewed publications from leading biomedical journals and conferences between 2017-2020, that reported the use of DA in medical imaging applications, grouping them by methodology, image modality, and learning scenarios. We mainly focused on pathology and radiology as application areas. Among various DA approaches, we discussed domain transformation (DT) and latent feature-space transformation (LFST). We highlighted the role of unsupervised DA in image segmentation and described opportunities for future development. DA has emerged as a promising solution to deal with the lack of annotated training data. Using adversarial techniques, unsupervised DA has achieved good performance, especially for segmentation tasks. Opportunities include domain transferability, multi-modal DA, and applications that benefit from synthetic data. ","56":"To give an overview of recent research and to propose a selection of best papers published in 2019 in the field of Clinical Information Systems (CIS). Each year, we apply a systematic process to retrieve articles for the CIS section of the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics. For six years now, we use the same query to find relevant publications in the CIS field. Each year we retrieve more than 2,000 papers. As CIS section editors, we categorize the retrieved articles in a multi-pass review to distill a pre-selection of 15 candidate best papers. Then, Yearbook editors and external reviewers assess the selected candidate best papers. Based on the review results, the IMIA Yearbook Editorial Committee chooses the best papers during the selection meeting. We used text mining, and term co-occurrence mapping techniques to get an overview of the content of the retrieved articles. We carried out the query in mid-January 2020 and retrieved a de-duplicated result set of 2,407 articles from 1,023 different journals. This year, we nominated 14 papers as candidate best papers, and three of them were finally selected as best papers in the CIS section. As in previous years, the content analysis of the articles revealed the broad spectrum of topics covered by CIS research. We could observe ongoing trends, as seen in the last years. Patient benefit research is in the focus of many research activities, and trans-institutional aggregation of data remains a relevant field of work. Powerful machine-learning-based approaches, that use readily available data now often outperform human-based procedures. However, the ethical perspective of this development often comes too short in the considerations. We thus assume that ethical aspects will and should deliver much food for thought for future CIS research. ","57":"The more people there are who use clinical information systems (CIS) beyond their traditional intramural confines, the more promising the benefits are, and the more daunting the risks will be. This review thus explores the areas of ethical debates prompted by CIS conceptualized as smart systems reaching out to patients and citizens. Furthermore, it investigates the ethical competencies and education needed to use these systems appropriately. A literature review covering ethics topics in combination with clinical and health information systems, clinical decision support, health information exchange, and various mobile devices and media was performed searching the MEDLINE database for articles from 2016 to 2019 with a focus on 2018 and 2019. A second search combined these keywords with education. By far, most of the discourses were dominated by privacy, confidentiality, and informed consent issues. Intertwined with confidentiality and clear boundaries, the provider-patient relationship has gained much attention. The opacity of algorithms and the lack of explicability of the results pose a further challenge. The necessity of sociotechnical ethics education was underpinned in many studies including advocating education for providers and patients alike. However, only a few publications expanded on ethical competencies. In the publications found, empirical research designs were employed to capture the stakeholders' attitudes, but not to evaluate specific implementations. Despite the broad discourses, ethical values have not yet found their firm place in empirically rigorous health technology evaluation studies. Similarly, sociotechnical ethics competencies obviously need detailed specifications. These two gaps set the stage for further research at the junction of clinical information systems and ethics. ","58":null,"59":"To provide an overview of recent work at the intersection of Biomedical Informatics, Human-Computer Interaction, and Ethics. Search terms for Human-Computer Interaction, Biomedical Informatics, and Ethics were used to identify relevant papers published between 2017 and 2019.Relevant papers were identified through multiple methods, including database searches, manual reviews of citations, recent publications, and special collections, as well as through peer recommendations. Identified articles were reviewed and organized into broad themes. We identified relevant papers at the intersection of Biomedical Informatics, Human-Computer Interactions, and Ethics in over a dozen journals. The content of these papers was organized into three broad themes: ethical issues associated with systems in use, systems design, and responsible conduct of research. The results of this overview demonstrate an active interest in exploring the ethical implications of Human-Computer Interaction concerns in Biomedical Informatics. Papers emphasizing ethical concerns associated with patient-facing tools, mobile devices, social media, privacy, inclusivity, and e-consent reflect the growing prominence of these topics in biomedical informatics research. New questions in these areas will likely continue to arise with the growth of precision medicine and citizen science. ","60":"To summarize the recent literature and research and present a selection of the best papers published in 2019 in the field of Health Information Management (HIM) and Health Informatics. A systematic review of the literature was performed by the two section editors with the help of a medical librarian. The search through bibliographic databases for HIM-related papers was achieved using both MeSH headings and keywords in titles and abstracts. A shortlist of 15 candidate best papers was first selected by section editors before being peer-reviewed by independent external reviewers. Over half of the 15 papers addressed the issue of data quality in the electronic health record (EHR). In addition to the focus on data quality, there were papers on other topics of long-standing interest to the field of HIM. These topics include privacy, security, and confidentiality of health information, comparability of different coding vocabularies, classifications and terminologies, and the HIM workforce. Finally, there were papers on newer topics for the HIM field, including mobile Health (mHealth), EHR use by public health departments, and usability of different strategies for displaying information in the EHR. Traditional HIM concerns about HIM practice and workforce as well as issues about data in the EHR including data quality, coding, and privacy and confidentiality continue to be a large part of the HIM research literature. However, newer topics which reflect innovative and emerging technologies, usability assessments, and the application of the EHR outside the traditional clinical setting are starting to appear and more research is needed on these newer areas. ","61":"To identify current patient identification techniques and approaches used worldwide in today's healthcare environment. To identify challenges associated with improper patient identification. A literature review of relevant peer-reviewed and grey literature published from January 2015 to October 2019 was conducted to inform the paper. The focus was on: 1) patient identification techniques and 2) unintended consequences and ramifications of unresolved patient identification issues. The literature review showed six common patient identification techniques implemented worldwide ranging from unique patient identifiers, algorithmic approaches, referential matching software, biometrics, radio frequency identification device (RFID) systems, and hybrid models. The review revealed three themes associated with unresolved patient identification: 1) treatment, care delivery, and patient safety errors, 2) cost and resource considerations, and 3) data sharing and interoperability challenges. Errors in patient identification have implications for patient care and safety, payment, as well as data sharing and interoperability. Different patient identification techniques ranging from unique patient identifiers and algorithms to hybrid models have been implemented worldwide. However, no current patient identification techniques have resulted in a 100% match rate. Optimizing algorithmic matching through data standardization and referential matching software should be studied further to identify opportunities to enhance patient identification techniques and approaches. Further efforts to improve patient identity management include adoption of patients' photos at registration, naming conventions, and standardized processes for recording patients' demographic data attributes. ","62":"To summarize significant research contributions on ethics in medical informatics published in 2019. An extensive search using PubMed\/Medline was conducted to identify the scientific contributions published in 2019 that address ethics issues in medical informatics. The selection process comprised three steps: 1) 15 candidate best papers were first selected by the two section editors; 2) external reviewers from internationally renowned research teams reviewed each candidate best paper; and 3) the final selection of three best papers was conducted by the editorial committee of the Yearbook. The three selected best papers explore timely issues of concern to the community and demonstrate how ethics considerations influence applied informatics. With regard to ethics in informatics, data sharing and privacy remain primary areas of concern. Ethics issues related to the development and implementation of artificial intelligence is an emerging topic of interest. ","63":"To survey international regulatory frameworks that serve to protect privacy of personal data as a human right as well as to review the literature regarding privacy protections and data ownership in mobile health (mHealth) technologies between January 1, 2016 and June 1, 2019 in order to identify common themes. We performed a review of relevant literature available in English published between January 1, 2016 and June 1, 2019 from databases including PubMed, Google Scholar, and Web of Science, as well as relevant legislative background material. Articles out of scope (as detailed below) were eliminated. We categorized the remaining pool of articles and discrete themes were identified, specifically: concerns around data transmission and storage, including data ownership and the ability to re-identify previously de-identified data; issues with user consent (including the availability of appropriate privacy policies) and access control; and the changing culture and variable global attitudes toward privacy of health data. Recent literature demonstrates that the security of mHealth data storage and transmission remains of wide concern, and aggregated data that were previously considered \"de-identified\" have now been demonstrated to be re-identifiable. Consumer-informed consent may be lacking with regard to mHealth applications due to the absence of a privacy policy and\/or to text that is too complex and lengthy for most users to comprehend. The literature surveyed emphasizes improved access control strategies. This survey also illustrates a wide variety of global user perceptions regarding health data privacy. The international regulatory framework that serves to protect privacy of personal data as a human right is diverse. Given the challenges legislators face to keep up with rapidly advancing technology, we introduce the concept of a \"healthcare fiduciary\" to serve the best interest of data subjects in the current environment.

As an international forum for peers in biomedical and health informatics, the Academy shall play an important role in exchanging knowledge, providing education and training, and producing policy documents. A major priority of the Academy's activities in its inaugural phase was to define its strategy and focus areas in accordance with its objectives and to prioritize the Academy's work, which can then be transferred to respective taskforces. This document reflects the major outcomes of intensive discussions that occurred during 2019. It was presented at the Academy's 3rd Plenary on August 25th, 2019, in Lyon, France. Regardless of the 'living nature' of the strategy and focus areas document, it was concluded during the Plenary that the first version, which will be used as a base for decisions on the Academy's future activities, should be made available to a broad audience. Three out of eight 'Visions for IAHSI', presented in the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2018, were identified as central for developing, implementing, and evaluating the Academy's strategic directions: (1) advise governments and organizations on developing health and health sciences through informatics, (2) stimulate progress in biomedical and health informatics research, education, and practice, and (3) share and exchange knowledge. Taskforces shall be implemented to work in the following areas, which were considered as priority themes: (1) artificial intelligence in health: future collaboration of entities with natural and with artificial intelligence in health care, and (2) current landscape of standards for digital health. Taskforces are now being established. Besides specific key performance indicators, suggested for monitoring the work of theses taskforces, the strategy to monitor the progress of the Academy itself has to be measured by relevant and acceptable metrics.

This editorial provides an introduction and overview to the 2020 IMIA Yearbook which special topic is: \"Ethics in Health Informatics\". The keynote paper, the survey paper of the Special Topic section, and the paper about Donald Lindberg's ethical scientific openness in the History of Medical Informatics chapter of the Yearbook are discussed. Changes in the Yearbook Editorial Committee are also described. Inspired by medical ethics, ethics in health informatics progresses with the advances in biomedical informatics. With the wide use of EHRs, the enlargement of the care team perimeter, the need for data sharing for care continuity, the reuse of data for the sake of research, and the implementation of AI-powered decision support tools, new ethics requirements are necessary to address issues such as threats on privacy, confidentiality breaches, poor security practices, lack of patient information, tension on data sharing and reuse policies, need for more transparency on apps effectiveness, biased algorithms with discriminatory outcomes, guarantee on trustworthy AI, concerns on the re-identification of de-identified data. Despite privacy rules rooted in the Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act of 1996 (HIPAA) in the USA and even more restrictive new regulations such as the EU General Data Protection Regulation published in May 2018, some people do not believe their data will be kept confidential and may not share sensitive information with a provider, which may also induce unethical situations. Transparency on healthcare data processes is a condition of healthcare professionals' and patients' trust and their adoption of digital tools. ","66":"","67":"To identify the different ethical issues that should be considered in participatory health through social media from different stakeholder perspectives (i.e., patients\/service users, health professionals, health information technology (If) professionals, and policy makers) in any healthcare context. We implemented a two-round survey composed of open ended questions in the first round, aggregated into a list of ethical issues rated for importance by participants in the second round, to generate a ranked list of possible ethical issues in participatory health based on healthcare professionals' and policy makers' opinions on both their own point of view and their beliefs for other stakeholders' perspectives. Twenty-six individuals responded in the first round of the survey. Multiple ethical issues were identified for each perspective. Data privacy, data security, and digital literacy were common themes in all perspectives. Thirty-three individuals completed the second round of the survey. Data privacy and data security were ranked among the three most important ethical issues in all perspectives. Quality assurance was the most important issue from the healthcare professionals' perspective and the second most important issue from the patients' perspective. Data privacy was the most important consideration for patients\/service users. Digital literacy was ranked as the fourth most important issue, except for policy makers' perspective. Different stakeholders' opinions fairly agreed that there are common ethical issues that should be considered across the four groups (patients, healthcare professionals, health IT professionals, policy makers) such as data privacy, security, and quality assurance. ","68":"Human and Organizational Factors (HOF) studies in health technology involve human beings and thus require Institutional Review Board (IRB) approval. Yet HOF studies have specific constraints and methods that may not fit standard regulations and IRB practices. Gaining IRB approval may pose difficulties for HOF researchers. This paper aims to provide a first overview of HOF study challenges to get IRB review by exploring differences and best practices across different countries. HOF researchers were contacted by email to provide a testimony about their experience with IRB review and approval. Testimonies were thematically analyzed and synthesized to identify and discuss shared themes. Researchers from seven European countries, Argentina, Canada, Australia, and the United States answered the call. Four themes emerged that indicate shared challenges in legislation, IRB inefficiencies and inconsistencies, general regulation and costs, and lack of HOF study knowledge by IRB members. We propose a model for IRB review of HOF studies based on best practices. International criteria are needed that define low and high-risk HOF studies, to allow identification of studies that can undergo an expedited (or exempted) process from those that need full IRB review. Enhancing IRB processes in such a way would be beneficial to the conduct of HOF studies. Greater knowledge and promotion of HOF methods and evidence-based HOF study designs may support the evolving discipline. Based on these insights, training and guidance to IRB members may be developed to support them in ensuring that appropriate ethical issues for HOF studies are considered. ","69":"Most diseases result from the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors. The exposome can be defined as a systematic approach to acquire large data sets corresponding to environmental exposures of an individual along her\/ his life. The objective of this contribution is to raise awareness within the health informatics community about the importance of dealing with data related to the contribution of environmental factors to individual health, particularly in the context of precision medicine informatics. This article summarizes the main findings after a panel organized by the International Medical Informatics Association - Exposome Informatics Working Group held during the last MEDINFO, in Lyon (France) in August 2019. The members of our community presented four initiatives (PULSE, Digital exposome, Cloudy with a chance of pain, Wearable clinics), providing a detailed view of current challenges and accomplishments in processing environmental and social data from a health research perspective. Projects illustrate a wide range of research methods, digital data collection technologies, and analytics and visualization tools. This reinforces the idea that this area is now ready for health informaticians to step in and contribute their expertise, leading the application of informatics strategies to understand environmental health problems. The featured projects illustrate applications that use exposome data for the investigation of the causes of diseases, health care, patient empowerment, and public health. They offer a rich overview of the expanding range of applications that informatics is finding in the field of environmental health, with potential impact in precision medicine. ","70":"To create practical recommendations for the curation of routinely collected health data and artificial intelligence (AI) in primary care with a focus on ensuring their ethical use. We defined data curation as the process of management of data throughout its lifecycle to ensure it can be used into the future. We used a literature review and Delphi exercises to capture insights from the Primary Care Informatics Working Group (PCIWG) of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA). We created six recommendations: (1) Ensure consent and formal process to govern access and sharing throughout the data life cycle; (2) Sustainable data creation\/collection requires trust and permission; (3) Pay attention to Extract-Transform-Load (ETL) processes as they may have unrecognised risks; (4) Integrate data governance and data quality management to support clinical practice in integrated care systems; (5) Recognise the need for new processes to address the ethical issues arising from AI in primary care; (6) Apply an ethical framework mapped to the data life cycle, including an assessment of data quality to achieve effective data curation. The ethical use of data needs to be integrated within the curation process, hence running throughout the data lifecycle. Current information systems may not fully detect the risks associated with ETL and AI; they need careful scrutiny. With distributed integrated care systems where data are often used remote from documentation, harmonised data quality assessment, management, and governance is important. These recommendations should help maintain trust and connectedness in contemporary information systems and planned developments. ","71":"To understand ethical issues within the tele-health domain, specifically how well established macro level telehealth guidelines map with micro level practitioner perspectives. We developed four overarching issues to use as a starting point for developing an ethical framework for telehealth. We then reviewed telemedicine ethics guidelines elaborated by the American Medical Association (AMA), the World Medical Association (WMA), and the telehealth component of the Health Professions council of South Africa (HPCSA). We then compared these guidelines with practitioner perspectives to identify the similarities and differences between them. Finally, we generated suggestions to bridge the gap between ethics guidelines and the micro level use of telehealth. Clear differences emerged between the ethics guidelines and the practitioner perspectives. The main reason for the differences were the different contexts where telehealth was used, for example, variability in international practice and variations in the complexity of patient-provider interactions. Overall, published guidelines largely focus on macro level issues related to technology and maintaining data security in patient-provider interactions while practitioner concern is focused on applying the guidelines to specific micro level contexts. Ethics guidelines on telehealth have a macro level focus in contrast to the micro level needs of practitioners. Work is needed to close this gap. We recommend that both telehealth practitioners and ethics guideline developers better understand healthcare systems and adopt a learning health system approach that draws upon different contexts of clinical practice, innovative models of care delivery, emergent data and evidence-based outcomes. This would help develop a clearer set of priorities and guidelines for the ethical conduct of telehealth. ","72":"The Grenoble (France) Master's degree in health includes 17 sub-specialty programs, 120 separate teaching units (TUs) and caters for up to 400 students per year. We present the pedagogical transition to blended learning based on flipped classroom initiated in 2010 to overcome the pedagogical limitations of classical lectures. The pedagogical organization of each TU is based on the weekly and sequential implementation of five sequences. The first three sequences comprise the learning stages of (1) self-learning on knowledge capsules, (2) interactive on-line questions and votes of interest, and (3) interactive on-site training and explanation meetings. The last two sequences include the evaluation stages with (4) positioning tests, and (5) an anonymous evaluation of the TU allowing access to personalized follow-ups. This pedagogical sequence is completed with a final certification on a tablet computer. The systematic evaluation and debriefing sessions of TUs gave us a clear SWOT vision of the revised Master's degree in health. The feedback was very positive from students, teachers, and the institution, which encourages us to move forward in this transition. Nonetheless, some of this positive feedback was unexpected, such as the ease of managing mobile learners (e.g. Erasmus, International internship) or personalized reinforcement. Our results indicate that a switch to blended learning is feasible in a large Master program, with improvements on student\/teacher equity and for the institution. ","73":"Contemporary bioethics was fledged and is sustained by challenges posed by new technologies. These technologies have affected many lives. Yet health informatics affects more lives than any of them. The challenges include the development and the appropriate uses and users of machine learning software, the balancing of privacy rights against the needs of public health and clinical practice in a time of Big Data analytics, whether and how to use this technology, and the role of ethics and standards in health policy. Historical antecedents in statistics and evidence-based practice foreshadow some of the difficulties now faced, but the scope and scale of these challenges requires that ethics, too, be brought to scale in parallel, especially given the size of contemporary data sets and the processing power of new computers. Fortunately, applied ethics affords a variety of tools to help identify and rank applicable values, support best practices, and contribute to standards. The bioethics community can in partnership with the informatics community arrive at policies that promote the health sciences while reaffirming the many and varied rights that patients expect will be honored.","74":"To summarize the major activities of the International Academy of Health Sciences Informatics (IAHSI) from 2018 until 2019, and to provide an outline of actions planned for 2020. Reporting about these activities and actions by the members of the Academy's first Board. Academy bylaws were accepted by the Academy Plenary and the IMIA General Assembly on August 25th, 2019 and August 26th, 2019, respectively. Academy's strategy and focus areas were developed. Based on the Academy's eligibility criteria, the 2018\/2019 Class made of 26 new Academy Fellows was elected. Future activities will concentrate on building taskforces for developing and implementing major Academy focus areas. We are glad to report that the Academy is strong and thriving. ","75":"As Director of the US National Library of Medicine (NLM) for 30 years, Dr. Donald A. B. Lindberg was instrumental in bringing biomedical research and healthcare worldwide into the age of genomic and translational medicine through the informatics systems developed by the NLM. Lindberg opened free access and worldwide public dissemination of all the NLM's biomedical literature and databases, thus helping transform not only biomedical research like the Human Genome Project and its successors, but also the practices of medicine and healthcare internationally. Guiding, leading, and teaching-by-example at national, regional, and global levels of biomedical and healthcare informatics, Lindberg helped coalesce a dynamic discipline that provides a foundation for the human understanding which promotes the future health of our world. To provide historical insight into the scientific, technological, and practical clinical accomplishments of Donald Lindberg, and to describe how this led to contributions in the worldwide interdisciplinary evolution of informatics, and its impact on the biosciences and practices of medicine, nursing, and other healthcare-related disciplines. Review and comment on the publications, scientific contributions, and leadership of Donald Lindberg in the evolution of biomedical and health informatics which anticipate the vision, scholarship, research in the field, and represent the deeply ethical humanism he exhibited throughout his life. These were essential in producing the informatics systems, such as the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS), MEDLINE, PubMed, PubMed Central, and ClinicalTrials.gov, which, together with NLM training programs and conferences, made possible the interactions among researchers and practitioners leading to the past quarter-century of rapid and dramatic advances in biomedical scientific inquiry and clinical discoveries, openly shared across the globe. Dr. Lindberg was a uniquely talented physician and pioneering researcher in biomedical and health informatics. As the main leader in developing and funding innovative informatics research for more than 30 years as Director of the National Library of Medicine, he helped bring together the most creative interdisciplinary researchers to bridge the worlds of biomedical research, education, and clinical practice. Lindberg's emphasis on open-access to the biomedical literature through publicly shared computer-mediated methods of search and inquiry are seen as an example of ethical scientific openness. ","76":"To summarize significant research contributions on cancer informatics published in 2018. An extensive search using PubMed\/Medline, Google Scholar, and manual review was conducted to identify the scientific contributions published in 2018 that address topics in cancer informatics. The selection process comprised three steps: (i) 15 candidate best papers were first selected by the two section editors, (ii) external reviewers from internationally renowned research teams reviewed each candidate best paper, and (iii) the final selection of four best papers was conducted by the editorial board of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook. The four selected best papers present studies addressing many facets of cancer informatics, with immediate applicability in the translational and clinical domains. Cancer informatics is a broad and vigorous subfield of biomedical informatics. Progress in cancer genomics, artificial intelligence, and passively collected data is especially notable in 2018. ","77":"To introduce and summarize current research in the field of Public Health and Epidemiology Informatics. The 2018 literature concerning public health and epidemiology informatics was searched in PubMed and Web of Science, and the returned references were reviewed by the two section editors to select 15 candidate best papers. These papers were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers to give the editorial team an enlightened selection of the best papers. Among the 805 references retrieved from PubMed and Web of Science, three were finally selected as best papers. All three papers are about surveillance using digital tools. One study is about the surveillance of flu, another about emerging animal infectious diseases and the last one is about foodborne illness. The sources of information are Google news, Twitter, and Yelp restaurant reviews. Machine learning approaches are most often used to detect signals. Surveillance is a central topic in public health informatics with the growing use of machine learning approaches in regards of the size and complexity of data. The evaluation of the approaches developed remains a serious challenge. ","78":"To provide an oveiview of the current application of artificial intelligence (AI) in the field of public health and epidemiology, with a special focus on antimicrobial resistance and the impact of climate change in disease epidemiology. Both topics are of vital importance and were included in the \"Ten threats to global health in 2019\" report published by the World Health Organization. We analysed publications that appeared in the last two years, between January 2017 and October 2018. Papers were searched using Google Scholar with the following keywords: public health, epidemiology, machine learning, data analytics, artificial intelligence, disease surveillance, climate change, antimicrobial resistance, and combinations thereof. Selected articles were organised by theme. In spite of a large interest in AI generated both within and outside the scientific community, and of the many opinions pointing towards the importance of a better use of data in public health, few papers have been published on the selected topics in the last two years. We identify several potential reasons, including the complexity of the integration of heterogeneous data, and the lack of sound and unbiased validation procedures. As there is a better comprehension of AI and more funding available, artificial intelligence will become not only the centre of attention in informatics, but more importantly the source of innovative solutions for public health. ","79":"To analyze the content of publications within the medical Natural Language Processing (NLP) domain in 2018. Automatic and manual pre-selection of publications to be reviewed, and selection of the best NLP papers of the year. Analysis of the important issues. Two best papers have been selected this year. One dedicated to the generation of multi- documents summaries and another dedicated to the generation of imaging reports. We also proposed an analysis of the content of main research trends of NLP publications in 2018. The year 2018 is very rich with regard to NLP issues and topics addressed. It shows the will of researchers to go towards robust and reproducible results. Researchers also prove to be creative for original issues and approaches. ","80":"We present a narrative review of recent work on the utilisation of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for the analysis of social media (including online health communities) specifically for public health applications. We conducted a literature review of NLP research that utilised social media or online consumer-generated text for public health applications, focussing on the years 2016 to 2018. Papers were identified in several ways, including PubMed searches and the inspection of recent conference proceedings from the Association of Computational Linguistics (ACL), the Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems (CHI), and the International AAAI (Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence) Conference on Web and Social Media (ICWSM). Popular data sources included Twitter, Reddit, various online health communities, and Facebook. In the recent past, communicable diseases (e.g., influenza, dengue) have been the focus of much social media-based NLP health research. However, mental health and substance use and abuse (including the use of tobacco, alcohol, marijuana, and opioids) have been the subject of an increasing volume of research in the 2016 - 2018 period. Associated with this trend, the use of lexicon-based methods remains popular given the availability of psychologically validated lexical resources suitable for mental health and substance abuse research. Finally, we found that in the period under review \"modern\" machine learning methods (i.e. deep neural-network-based methods), while increasing in popularity, remain less widely used than \"classical\" machine learning methods. ","81":"To summarize key contributions to current research in the field of Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) and to select best papers published in 2018. A bibliographic search using a combination of MeSH descriptors and free-text terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed by a double-blind review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. After peer-review ranking, a consensus meeting of the editorial team was organized to conclude on the selection of best papers. Among the 1,469 retrieved papers published in 2018 in the various areas of CRI, the full review process selected four best papers. The first best paper describes a simple algorithm detecting co-morbidities in Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs) using a clinical data warehouse and a knowledge base. The authors of the second best paper present a federated algorithm for predicting heart failure hospital admissions based on patients' medical history described in their distributed EHRs. The third best paper reports the evaluation of an open source, interoperable, and scalable data quality assessment tool measuring completeness of data items, which can be run on different architectures (EHRs and Clinical Data Warehouses (CDWs) based on PCORnet or OMOP data models). The fourth best paper reports a data quality program conducted across 37 hospitals addressing data quality Issues through the whole data life cycle from patient to researcher. Research efforts in the CRI field currently focus on consolidating promises of early Distributed Research Networks aimed at maximizing the potential of large-scale, harmonized data from diverse, quickly developing digital sources. Data quality assessment methods and tools as well as privacy-enhancing techniques are major concerns. It is also notable that, following examples in the US and Asia, ambitious regional or national plans in Europe are launched that aim at developing big data and new artificial intelligence technologies to contribute to the understanding of health and diseases in whole populations and whole health systems, and returning actionable feedback loops to improve existing models of research and care. The use of \"real-world\" data is continuously increasing but the ultimate role of this data in clinical research remains to be determined. ","82":"The diversity and volume of health data have been rapidly increasing in recent years. While such big data hold significant promise for accelerating discovery, data use entails many challenges including the need for adequate computational infrastructure and secure processes for data sharing and access. In Europe, two nationwide projects have been launched recently to support these objectives. This paper compares the French Health Data Hub initiative (HDH) to the German Medical Informatics Initiatives (MII). We analysed the projects according to the following criteria: (i) Global approach and ambitions, (ii) Use cases, (iii) Governance and organization, (iv) Technical aspects and interoperability, and (v) Data privacy access\/data governance. The French and German projects share the same objectives but are different in terms of methodologies. The HDH project is based on a top-down approach and focuses on a shared computational infrastructure, providing tools and services to speed projects between data producers and data users. The MII project is based on a bottom-up approach and relies on four consortia including academic hospitals, universities, and private partners. Both projects could benefit from each other. A Franco-German cooperation, extended to other countries of the European Union with similar initiatives, should allow sharing and strengthening efforts in a strategic area where competition from other countries has increased. ","83":"To summarize recent research and select the best papers published in 2018 in the field of Bioinformatics and Translational Informatics (BTI) for the corresponding section of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook. A literature review was performed for retrieving from PubMed papers indexed with keywords and free terms related to BTI. Independent review allowed the two section editors to select a list of 14 candidate best papers which were subsequently peer-reviewed. A final consensus meeting gathering the whole IMIA Yearbook editorial committee was organized to finally decide on the selection of the best papers. Among the 636 retrieved papers published in 2018 in the various subareas of BTI, the review process selected four best papers. The first paper presents a computational method to identify molecular markers for targeted treatment of acute myeloid leukemia using multi-omics data (genome-wide gene expression profiles) and in vitro sensitivity to 160 chemotherapy drugs. The second paper describes a deep neural network approach to predict the survival of patients suffering from glioma on the basis of digitalised pathology images and genomics biomarkers. The authors of the third paper adopt a pan-cancer approach to take benefit of multi-omics data for drug repurposing. The fourth paper presents a graph-based semi-supervised method to accurate phenotype classification applied to ovarian cancer. Thanks to the normalization of open data and open science practices, research in BTI continues to develop and mature. Noteworthy achievements are sophisticated applications of leading edge machine-learning methods dedicated to personalized medicine. ","84":"With the explosive growth in availability of health data captured using non-traditional sources, the goal for this work was to evaluate the current biomedical literature on theory- driven studies investigating approaches that leverage non- traditional data in personalized medicine applications. We conducted a literature assessment guided by the personalized medicine unsolicited health information (pUHl) conceptual framework incorporating diffusion of innovations and task-technology fit theories. The assessment provided an oveiview of the current literature and highlighted areas for future research. In particular, there is a need for: more research on the relationship between attributes of innovation and of societal structure on adoption; new study designs to enable flexible communication channels; more work to create and study approaches in healthcare settings; and more theory-driven studies with data-driven interventions. This work introduces to an informatics audience an elaboration on personalized medicine implementation with non-traditional data sources by blending it with the pUHl conceptual framework to help explain adoption. We highlight areas to pursue future theory-driven research on personalized medicine applications that leverage non-traditional data sources. ","85":"To summarise the state of the art during the year 2018 in consumer health informatics and education, with a special emphasis on the special topic of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook for 2019: \"Artificial intelligence in health: new opportunities, challenges, and practical implications\". We conducted a systematic search of articles published in PubMed using a predefined set of queries that identified 99 potential articles for review. These articles were screened according to topic relevance and 14 were selected for consideration as best paper candidates. The 14 papers were then presented to a panel of international experts for full paper review and scoring. Three papers that received the highest score were discussed in a consensus meeting and were agreed upon as best papers on artificial intelligence in health for patients and consumers in the year 2018. Only a small number of 2018 papers reported Artificial Intelligence (AI) research for patients and consumers. No studies were found on AI applications designed specifically for patients or consumers, nor were there studies that elicited patient and consumer input on AI. Currently, the most common use of AI for patients and consumers lies in secondary analysis of social media data (e.g., online discussion forums). In particular, the three best papers shared a common methodology of using data-driven algorithms (such as text mining, topic modelling, Latent Dirichlet allocation modelling), combined with insight-led approaches (e.g., visualisation, qualitative analysis and manual review), to uncover patient and consumer experiences of health and illness in online communities. While discussion remains active on how AI could 'revolutionise' healthcare delivery, there is a lack of direction and evidence on how AI could actually benefit patients and consumers. Perhaps instead of primarily focusing on data and algorithms, researchers should engage with patients and consumers early in the AI research agenda to ensure we are indeed asking the right questions, and that important use cases and critical contexts are identified together with patients and consumers. Without a clear understanding on why patients and consumers need AI in the first place, or how AI could support individuals with their healthcare needs, it is difficult to imagine the kinds of AI applications that would have meaningful and sustainable impact on individual daily lives. ","86":"To present the breadth and depth of Consumer Health Informatics (CHI) initiatives and in particular, identify areas to further enhance such solutions with the incorporation of advances in artificial intelligence (AI). A literature review was conducted. Inclusion criteria focused on barriers and facilitators as well as key milestones for CHI over the last 10 years. In addition, significant international initiatives in regions and \/or countries and opportunities to incorporate the advances of AI also made up the inclusion criteria. Exclusion criteria included factors that made reach\/range of solutions to individuals or groups of individuals less than 50 people. Journals in Medline were accessed as well as the grey literature. 200 papers were identified but this was narrowed to 25 due to repetitions and similarities of the types of solutions presented. From this, it was possible to identify key barriers and facilitators including: socio-political factors, financial factors, infrastructure, as well as levels of health literacy. The relatively nascent domain of CHI has developed and is growing. Full benefits will only be realized when more precision solutions that incorporate AI advances will be designed. The example of RxPredict is provided as a case vignette to illustrate. ","87":"To select, present, and summarize the best papers published in 2018 in the field of Knowledge Representation and Management (KRM). A comprehensive and standardized review of the medical informatics literature was performed to select the most interesting papers published in 2018 in KRM, based on PubMed and ISI Web Of Knowledge queries. Four best papers were selected among the 962 publications retrieved following the Yearbook review process. The research areas in 2018 were mainly related to the ontology-based data integration for phenotype-genotype association mining, the design of ontologies and their application, and the semantic annotation of clinical texts. In the KRM selection for 2018, research on semantic representations demonstrated their added value for enhanced deep learning approaches in text mining and for designing novel bioinformatics pipelines based on graph databases. In addition, the ontology structure can enrich the analyses of whole genome expression data. Finally, semantic representations demonstrated promising results to process phenotypic big data. ","88":"There exists a communication gap between the biomedical informatics community on one side and the computer science\/artificial intelligence community on the other side regarding the meaning of the terms \"semantic integration\" and \"knowledge representation\". This gap leads to approaches that attempt to provide one-to-one mappings between data elements and biomedical ontologies. Our aim is to clarify the representational differences between traditional data management and semantic-web-based data management by providing use cases of clinical data and clinical research data re-representation. We discuss how and why one-to-one mappings limit the advantages of using Semantic Web Technologies (SWTs). We employ commonly used SWTs, such as Resource Description Framework (RDF) and Ontology Web Language (OWL). We reuse pre-existing ontologies and ensure shared ontological commitment by selecting ontologies from a framework that fosters community-driven collaborative ontology development for biomedicine following the same set of principles. We demonstrate the results of providing SWT-compliant re-representation of data elements from two independent projects managing clinical data and clinical research data. Our results show how one-to-one mappings would hinder the exploitation of the advantages provided by using SWT. We conclude that SWT-compliant re-representation is an indispensable step, if using the full potential of SWT is the goal. Rather than providing one-to-one mappings, developers should provide documentation that links data elements to graph structures to specify the re-representation. ","89":"To summarize recent research and select the best papers published in 2018 in the field of computerized clinical decision support for the Decision Support section of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) yearbook. A literature review was performed by searching two bibliographic databases for papers referring to clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). The aim was to identify a list of candidate best papers from the retrieved bibliographic records, which were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. A consensus meeting of the IMIA editorial team finally selected the best papers on the basis of all reviews and the section editors' evaluation. Among 1,148 retrieved articles, 15 best paper candidates were selected, the review of which resulted in the selection of four best papers. The first paper introduces a deep learning model for estimating short-term life expectancy (&gt;3 months) of metastatic cancer patients by analyzing free-text clinical notes in electronic medical records, while maintaining the temporal visit sequence. The second paper takes note that CDSSs become routinely integrated in health information systems and compares statistical anomaly detection models to identify CDSS malfunctions which, if remain unnoticed, may have a negative impact on care delivery. The third paper fairly reports on lessons learnt from the development of an oncology CDSS using artificial intelligence techniques and from its assessment in a large US cancer center. The fourth paper implements a preference learning methodology for detecting inconsistencies in clinical practice guidelines and illustrates the applicability of the proposed methodology to antibiotherapy. Three of the four best papers rely on data-driven methods, and one builds on a knowledge-based approach. While there is currently a trend for data-driven decision support, the promising results of such approaches still need to be confirmed by the adoption of these systems and their routine use. ","90":"This survey analyses the latest literature contributions to clinical decision support systems (DSSs) on a two-year period (2017-2018), focusing on the approaches that adopt Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques in a broad sense. The goal is to analyse the distribution of data-driven AI approaches with respect to \"classical\" knowledge-based ones, and to consider the issues raised and their possible solutions. We included PubMed and Web of ScienceTM publications, focusing on contributions describing clinical DSSs that adopted one or more AI methodologies. We selected 75 papers, 49 of which describe approaches in the data-driven AI area, 20 present purely knowledge-based DSSs, and 6 adopt hybrid approaches relying on both formalized knowledge and data. Recent studies in the clinical DSS area demonstrate a prevalence of data-driven AI, which can be adopted autonomously in purely data-driven systems, or in cooperation with domain knowledge in hybrid systems. Such hybrid approaches, able to conjugate all available knowledge sources through proper knowledge integration steps, represent an interesting example of synergy between the two AI categories. This synergy can lead to the resolution of some existing issues, such as the need for transparency and explainability, nowadays recognized as central themes to be addressed by both AI and medical informatics research. ","91":"To identify research works that exemplify recent developments in the field of sensors, signals, and imaging informatics. A broad literature search was conducted using PubMed and Web of Science, supplemented with individual papers that were nominated by section editors. A predefined query made from a combination of Medical Subject Heading (MeSH) terms and keywords were used to search both sources. Section editors then filtered the entire set of retrieved papers with each paper having been reviewed by two section editors. Papers were assessed on a three-point Likert scale by two section editors, rated from 0 (do not include) to 2 (should be included). Only papers with a combined score of 2 or above were considered. A search for papers was executed at the start of January 2019, resulting in a combined set of 1,459 records published in 2018 in 119 unique journals. Section editors jointly filtered the list of candidates down to 14 nominations. The 14 candidate best papers were then ranked by a group of eight external reviewers. Four papers, representing different international groups and journals, were selected as the best papers by consensus of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook editorial board. The fields of sensors, signals, and imaging informatics have rapidly evolved with the application of novel artificial intelligence\/machine learning techniques. Studies have been able to discover hidden patterns and integrate different types of data towards improving diagnostic accuracy and patient outcomes. However, the quality of papers varied widely without clear reporting standards for these types of models. Nevertheless, a number of papers have demonstrated useful techniques to improve the generalizability, interpretability, and reproducibility of increasingly sophisticated models. ","92":"Camera-based vital sign estimation allows the contactless assessment of important physiological parameters. Seminal contributions were made in the 1930s, 1980s, and 2000s, and the speed of development seems ever increasing. In this suivey, we aim to overview the most recent works in this area, describe their common features as well as shortcomings, and highlight interesting \"outliers\". We performed a comprehensive literature research and quantitative analysis of papers published between 2016 and 2018. Quantitative information about the number of subjects, studies with healthy volunteers vs. pathological conditions, public datasets, laboratory vs. real-world works, types of camera, usage of machine learning, and spectral properties of data was extracted. Moreover, a qualitative analysis of illumination used and recent advantages in terms of algorithmic developments was also performed. Since 2016, 116 papers were published on camera-based vital sign estimation and 59% of papers presented results on 20 or fewer subjects. While the average number of participants increased from 15.7 in 2016 to 22.9 in 2018, the vast majority of papers (n=100) were on healthy subjects. Four public datasets were used in 10 publications. We found 27 papers whose application scenario could be considered a real-world use case, such as monitoring during exercise or driving. These include 16 papers that dealt with non-healthy subjects. The majority of papers (n=61) presented results based on visual, red-green-blue (RGB) information, followed by RGB combined with other parts of the electromagnetic spectrum (n=18), and thermography only (n=12), while other works (n=25) used other mono- or polychromatic non-RGB data. Surprisingly, a minority of publications (n=39) made use of consumer-grade equipment. Lighting conditions were primarily uncontrolled or ambient. While some works focused on specialized aspects such as the removal of vital sign information from video streams to protect privacy or the influence of video compression, most algorithmic developments were related to three areas: region of interest selection, tracking, or extraction of a one-dimensional signal. Seven papers used deep learning techniques, 17 papers used other machine learning approaches, and 92 made no explicit use of machine learning. Although some general trends and frequent shortcomings are obvious, the spectrum of publications related to camera-based vital sign estimation is broad. While many creative solutions and unique approaches exist, the lack of standardization hinders comparability of these techniques and of their performance. We believe that sharing algorithms and\/ or datasets will alleviate this and would allow the application of newer techniques such as deep learning. ","93":"To summarize recent research and to propose a selection of best papers published in 2018 in the field of Clinical Information Systems (CIS). Each year a systematic process is carried out to retrieve articles for the CIS section of the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics and to select a set of pest papers for the section. The same query as in the last five years was used. The retrieved articles were categorized in a multi-pass review carried out by the two section editors. The final selection of candidate papers was then peer-reviewed by Yearbook editors and external reviewers. Based on the review results the best papers were then chosen at the selection meeting with the IMIA Yearbook editorial board. Text mining, and term co-occurrence mapping techniques were again used to get an overview of the content of the retrieved articles. The query was carried out in mid-January 2019, yielding a consolidated, deduplicated result set of 2,264 articles which had been published in 957 different journals. This year, we nominated twelve papers as candidates and three of them were finally selected as best papers in the CIS section. Again, the content analysis of the articles revealed the broad spectrum of topics which is covered by CIS research. We could observe ongoing trends from our 2017 analysis. The patient increasingly moves in the focus of the research activities and trans-institutional aggregation of data is still an important field of work. The move to use patient and other clinical data directly for the patient and to support data driven process management, the move away from clinical documentation to patient-focused knowledge generation and support of informed decision, is gaining momentum by the application of new or already known but, due to technological advances, now applicable methodological approaches.

Then, we completed the analysis using search engines to also include papers from major conferences over the same five years. We defined a taxonomy of major features and research areas of CIS, HIS, EHR systems. We also defined a taxonomy for the use of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques on healthcare data. In the light of these taxonomies, we report on the most relevant papers from the literature.

We reviewed recent literature on human factors and usability problems of health IT and research on human-centered design of health IT for clinicians and patients. Studies continue to show usability problems of health IT experienced by multiple groups of health care professionals (e.g., physicians and nurses) as well as patients. Recent research shows that usability is influenced by both designers (e.g., IT vendors) and implementers in health care organizations, and that the application of human-centered design practices needs to be further improved and extended. We welcome emerging research on the design of health IT for teams as team-based care is increasingly implemented throughout health care. Progress in the application of human factors methods and principles to the design of health IT is occurring, with important information provided on their actual impact on care processes and patient outcomes. Future research should examine the work of health IT designers and implementers, which would help to develop strategies for further embedding human factors engineering in IT design processes.

A systematic review of the literature was performed, with the help of a medical librarian, by the two editors of the HIM section of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook. In order to include papers that would address the special theme of the 2019 Yearbook on artificial intelligence (AI) as well as HIM, we searched bibliographic databases for HIM-related papers with an AI focus using both Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) descriptors and keywords in titles and abstracts. A shortlist of 15 candidate best papers was first selected by section editors before being peer-reviewed by independent external reviewers. While there were a significant number of manuscripts that addressed issues relevant to HIM, there were virtually none with MeSH headings indicating an HIM focus. Manuscripts that were considered related to the HIM field in terms of the practice of health information management as well as the profession included those that examined using machine learning and other AI approaches to identify protected health information in clinical text to aid with de-identification, automated coding approaches to translate free-text into standardized codes, and natural language processing approaches to extract clinical data to assist with populating cancer and other registries. The papers discussed in the HIM section reflect the special theme of the use of AI in healthcare on issues particularly relevant to the field of HIM. This synopsis discusses these papers and recommends that HIM practitioners be more involved in research and that researchers in AI and related areas recognize the applicability and relevance of their work to the field of HIM.

A literature review was conducted of both peer-reviewed literature and published opinions on current and future use of AI technology to collect, store, and use healthcare data. The authors also sought insights from key HIM leaders via semi-structured interviews conducted both on the phone and by email. The following HIM practices are impacted by AI technologies: 1) Automated medical coding and capturing AI-based information; 2) Healthcare data management and data governance; 3) Fbtient privacy and confidentiality; and 4) HIM workforce training and education. HIM professionals must focus on improving the quality of coded data that is being used to develop AI applications. HIM professional's ability to identify data patterns will be an important skill as automation advances, though additional skills in data analysis tools and techniques are needed. In addition, HIM professionals should consider how current patient privacy practices apply to AI application, development, and use. AI technology will continue to evolve as will the role of HIM professionals who are in a unique position to take on emerging roles with their depth of knowledge on the sources and origins of healthcare data. The challenge for HIM professionals is to identify leading practices for the management of healthcare data and information in an AI-enabled world.

The increase in computer hardware and software applications in medicine, as well as digitization of health-related data together fuel progress in the development and use of AI in medicine. This progress provides new opportunities and challenges, as well as directions for the future of AI in health. The goals of this survey are to review the current state of AI in health, along with opportunities, challenges, and practical implications. This review highlights recent developments over the past five years and directions for the future. Publications over the past five years reporting the use of AI in health in clinical and biomedical informatics journals, as well as computer science conferences, were selected according to Google Scholar citations. Publications were then categorized into five different classes, according to the type of data analyzed. The major data types identified were multi-omics, clinical, behavioral, environmental and pharmaceutical research and development (R&amp;D) data. The current state of AI related to each data type is described, followed by associated challenges and practical implications that have emerged over the last several years. Opportunities and future directions based on these advances are discussed. Technologies have enabled the development of AI-assisted approaches to healthcare. However, there remain challenges.

This editorial presents an overview and introduction to the 2019 IMIA Yearbook which includes the special topic \"Artificial Intelligence in Health: New Opportunities, Challenges, and Practical Implications\". The special topic is discussed, the IMIA President's statement is introduced, and changes in the Yearbook editorial team are described. Artificial intelligence (AI) in Medicine arose in the 1970's from new approaches for representing expert knowledge with computers. Since then, AI in medicine has gradually evolved toward essentially data-driven approaches with great results in image analysis. However, data integration, storage, and management still present clear challenges among which the lack of explanability of the results produced by data-driven AI methods. With more health data availability, and the recent developments of efficient and improved machine learning algorithms, there is a renewed interest for AI in medicine.The objective is to help health professionals improve patient care while also reduce costs. However, the other costs of AI, including ethical issues when processing personal health data by algorithms, should be included. ","103":"","104":"Artificial Intelligence (AI) offers significant potential for improving healthcare. This paper discusses how an \"open science\" approach to AI tool development, data sharing, education, and research can support the clinical adoption of AI systems. In response to the call for participation for the 2019 International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Yearbook theme issue on AI in healthcare, the IMIA Open Source Working Group conducted a rapid review of recent literature relating to open science and AI in healthcare and discussed how an open science approach could help overcome concerns about the adoption of new AI technology in healthcare settings. The recent literature reveals that open science approaches to AI system development are well established. The ecosystem of software development, data sharing, education, and research in the AI community has, in general, adopted an open science ethos that has driven much of the recent innovation and adoption of new AI techniques. However, within the healthcare domain, adoption may be inhibited by the use of \"black-box\" AI systems, where only the inputs and outputs of those systems are understood, and clinical effectiveness and implementation studies are missing. As AI-based data analysis and clinical decision support systems begin to be implemented in healthcare systems around the world, further openness of clinical effectiveness and mechanisms of action may be required by safety-conscious healthcare policy-makers to ensure they are clinically effective in real world use. ","105":"This paper draws attention to: i) key considerations for evaluating artificial intelligence (AI) enabled clinical decision support; and ii) challenges and practical implications of AI design, development, selection, use, and ongoing surveillance. A narrative review of existing research and evaluation approaches along with expert perspectives drawn from the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) Working Group on Technology Assessment and Quality Development in Health Informatics and the European Federation for Medical Informatics (EFMI) Working Group for Assessment of Health Information Systems. There is a rich history and tradition of evaluating AI in healthcare. While evaluators can learn from past efforts, and build on best practice evaluation frameworks and methodologies, questions remain about how to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of AI that dynamically harness vast amounts of genomic, biomarker, phenotype, electronic record, and care delivery data from across health systems. This paper first provides a historical perspective about the evaluation of AI in healthcare. It then examines key challenges of evaluating AI-enabled clinical decision support during design, development, selection, use, and ongoing surveillance. Practical aspects of evaluating AI in healthcare, including approaches to evaluation and indicators to monitor AI are also discussed. Commitment to rigorous initial and ongoing evaluation will be critical to ensuring the safe and effective integration of AI in complex sociotechnical settings. Specific enhancements that are required for the new generation of AI-enabled clinical decision support will emerge through practical application. ","106":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is heralded as an approach that might augment or substitute for the limited processing power of the human brain of primary health care (PHC) professionals. However, there are concerns that AI-mediated decisions may be hard to validate and challenge, or may result in rogue decisions. To form consensus about perceptions, issues, and challenges of AI in primary care. A three-round Delphi study was conducted. Round 1 explored experts' viewpoints on AI in PHC (n=20). Round 2 rated the appropriateness of statements arising from round one (n=12). The third round was an online panel discussion of findings (n=8) with the members of both the International Medical Informatics Association and the European Federation of Medical Informatics Primary Health Care Informatics Working Groups. PHC and informatics experts reported AI has potential to improve managerial and clinical decisions and processes, and this would be facilitated by common data standards. The respondents did not agree that AI applications should learn and adapt to clinician preferences or behaviour and they did not agree on the extent of AI potential for harm to patients. It was more difficult to assess the impact of AI-based applications on continuity and coordination of care. While the use of AI in medicine should enhance healthcare delivery, we need to ensure meticulous design and evaluation of AI applications. The primary care informatics community needs to be proactive and to guide the ethical and rigorous development of AI applications so that they will be safe and effective. ","107":"This paper provides a discussion about the potential scope of applicability of Artificial Intelligence methods within the telehealth domain. These methods are focussed on clinical needs and provide some insight to current directions, based on reports of recent advances. Examples of telehealth innovations involving Artificial Intelligence to support or supplement remote health care delivery were identified from recent literature by the authors, on the basis of expert knowledge. Observations from the examples were synthesized to yield an overview of contemporary directions for the perceived role of Artificial Intelligence in telehealth. Two major focus areas for related contemporary directions were established. These were first, quality improvement for existing clinical practice and service delivery, and second, the development and support of new models of care. Case studies from each focus area have been chosen for illustration purposes. Examples of the role of Artificial Intelligence in delivery of health care remotely include use of tele-assessment, tele-diagnosis, tele-interactions, and tele-monitoring. Further developments of underlying algorithms and validation of methods will be required for wider adoption. Certain key social and ethical considerations also need consideration more generally in the health system, as Artificial-Intelligence-enabled-telehealth becomes more commonplace. ","108":"Artificial intelligence (AI) provides people and professionals working in the field of participatory health informatics an opportunity to derive robust insights from a variety of online sources. The objective of this paper is to identify current state of the art and application areas of AI in the context of participatory health. A search was conducted across seven databases (PubMed, Embase, CINAHL, PsychInfo, ACM Digital Library, IEEExplore, and SCOPUS), covering articles published since 2013. Additionally, clinical trials involving AI in participatory health contexts registered at clinicaltrials.gov were collected and analyzed. Twenty-two articles and 12 trials were selected for review. The most common application of AI in participatory health was the secondary analysis of social media data: self-reported data including patient experiences with healthcare facilities, reports of adverse drug reactions, safety and efficacy concerns about over-the-counter medications, and other perspectives on medications. Other application areas included determining which online forum threads required moderator assistance, identifying users who were likely to drop out from a forum, extracting terms used in an online forum to learn its vocabulary, highlighting contextual information that is missing from online questions and answers, and paraphrasing technical medical terms for consumers. While AI for supporting participatory health is still in its infancy, there are a number of important research priorities that should be considered for the advancement of the field. Further research evaluating the impact of AI in participatory health informatics on the psychosocial wellbeing of individuals would help in facilitating the wider acceptance of AI into the healthcare ecosystem. ","109":"Artificial intelligence (AI) is widespread in many areas, including medicine. However, it is unclear what exactly AI encompasses. This paper aims to provide an improved understanding of medical AI and its constituent fields, and their interplay with knowledge representation (KR). We followed a Wittgensteinian approach (\"meaning by usage\") applied to content metadata labels, using the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) thesaurus to classify the field. To understand and characterize medical AI and the role of KR, we analyzed: (1) the proportion of papers in MEDLINE related to KR and various AI fields; (2) the interplay among KR and AI fields and overlaps among the AI fields; (3) interconnectedness of fields; and (4) phrase frequency and collocation based on a corpus of abstracts. Data from over eighty thousand papers showed a steep, six-fold surge in the last 30 years. This growth happened in an escalating and cascading way. A corpus of 246,308 total words containing 21,842 unique words showed several hundred occurrences of notions such as robotics, fuzzy logic, neural networks, machine learning and expert systems in the phrase frequency analysis. Collocation analysis shows that fuzzy logic seems to be the most often collocated notion. Neural networks and machine learning are also used in the conceptual neighborhood of KR. Robotics is more isolated. Authors note an escalation of published AI studies in medicine. Knowledge representation is one of the smaller areas, but also the most interconnected, and provides a common cognitive layer for other areas. ","110":"To provide an overview of research trends and a review regarding the learning efficacy of serious games for health professions education taking into account short-term learning outcomes. For the review of research trends, we performed the search on Web of Science from 1996 until the present. For the scoping review on learning efficacy, ERIC, Education Source, PsychINFO, Global Health, CINAHL, Web Of Science, and Medline were searched. The publications trend is characterized by three phases: (i) an exploratory phase up to 2006, (ii) an early growth from 2007 to 2012, and (iii) a development phase from 2013 onwards. A total of 25 studies were identified in the scoping review. Sixteen had both pre-test and post-test, all of them showed significant improvement in learning scores after the use of serious games. Eighteen publications conducted controlled experiments, of which 14 indicated that post-test scores after serious games were significantly higher than with conventional teaching methods. The review revealed the lack of integration of affective learning with other competencies, as well as the need for serious games targeting postgraduate education. Serious games research remains emergent. Using serious games for health professions education seems efficacious for short-term learning. Addressing more competencies and health professionals across the education continuum is needed before generalizable definitive statements can be made. ","111":"Whilst general artificial intelligence (AI) is yet to appear, today's narrow AI is already good enough to transform much of healthcare over the next two decades. There is much discussion of the potential benefits of AI in healthcare and this paper reviews the cost that may need to be paid for these benefits, including changes in the way healthcare is practiced, patients are engaged, medical records are created, and work is reimbursed. Whilst AI will be applied to classic pattern recognition tasks like diagnosis or treatment recommendation, it is likely to be as disruptive to clinical work as it is to care delivery. Digital scribe systems that use AI to automatically create electronic health records promise great efficiency for clinicians but may lead to potentially very different types of clinical records and workflows. In disciplines like radiology, AI is likely to see image interpretation become an automated process with diminishing human engagement. Primary care is also being disrupted by AI-enabled services that automate triage, along with services such as telemedical consultations. This altered future may necessarily see an economic change where clinicians are increasingly reimbursed for value, and AI is reimbursed at a much lower cost for volume. AI is likely to be associated with some of the biggest changes we will see in healthcare in our lifetime. To fully engage with this change brings promise of the greatest reward. To not engage is to pay the highest price. ","112":"Artificial Intelligence in Medicine (AIM) research is now 50 years old, having made great progress that has tracked the corresponding evolution of computer science, hardware technology, communications, and biomedicine. Characterized as being in its \"adolescence\" at an international meeting in 1991, and as \"coming of age\" at another meeting in 2007, the AIM field is now more visible and influential than ever before, paralleling the enthusiasm and accomplishments of artificial intelligence (AI) more generally. This article summarizes some of that AIM history, providing an update on the status of the field as it enters its second half-century. It acknowledges the failure of AI, including AIM, to live up to early predictions of its likely capabilities and impact. The paper reviews and assesses the early history of the AIM field, referring to the conclusions of papers based on the meetings in 1991 and 2007, and analyzing the subsequent evolution of AIM. We must be cautious in assessing the speed at which further progress will be made, despite today's wild predictions in the press and large investments by industry, including in health care. The inherent complexity of medicine and of clinical care necessitates that we address issues of usability, workflow, transparency, safety, and formal clinical trials. These requirements contribute to an ongoing research agenda that means academic AIM research will continue to be vibrant while having new opportunities for more interactions with industry. ","113":"The rise of biomedical expert heuristic knowledge-based approaches for computational modeling and problem solving, for scientific inquiry and medical decision-making, and for consultation in the 1970's led to a major change in the paradigm that affected all of artificial intelligence (AI) research. Since then, AI has evolved, surviving several \"winters\", as it has oscillated between relying on expensive and hard-to-validate knowledge-based approaches, and the alternative of using machine learning methods for inferring classification rules from labelled datasets. In the past couple of decades, we are seeing a gradual but progressive intertwining of the two. To give an overview of early directions in AI in medicine and threads of some subsequent developments motivated by the very different goals of scientific inquiry for biomedical research, and for computational modeling of clinical reasoning and more general healthcare problem solving from the perspective of today's \"AI-Deep Learning Boom\". To show how, from the beginning, AI was central to Biomedical and Health Informatics (BMHI), as a field investigating how to understand intelligent thinking in dealing professionally with the practice for healthcare, developing mathematical models, technology, and software tools to aid human experts in biomedicine, despite many previous bouts of \"exuberant optimism\" about the methodologies deployed. An overview and commentary on some of the early research and publications in AI in biomedicine, emphasizing the different approaches to the modeling of problems involved in clinical practice in contrast to those of biomedical science. A concluding reflection of a few current challenges and pitfalls of AI in some biomedical applications. While biomedical knowledge-based systems played a critical role in influencing AI in its early days, 50 years later they have taken a back seat behind \"Deep Learning\" which promises to discover knowledge structures for inference and prediction, both in science and for clinical decision-support. Early work on AI for medical consultation turned out to be more useful for explanation and teaching than for clinical practice, as had been originally intended. Today, despite the many reported successes of deep learning, fundamental scientific challenges arise in drawing on models of brain science, cognition, and language, if AI is to augment and complement rather than replace human judgment and expertise in biomedicine while also incorporating these advances for translational medicine. Understanding clinical phenotypes and how they relate to precision and personalization of care requires not only scientific inquiry, but also humanistic models of treatment that respond to patient and practitioner narrative exchanges, since it is the stories and insights of human experts which encourage what Norbert Weiner termed the ethical \"human use of human beings\", so central to adherence to the Hippocratic Oath.

With precision medicine, artificial intelligence, and other treatment innovations on the horizon, health care professionals need to think more broadly about how to preserve privacy in a health care environment driven by data sharing.

It is timely for healthcare institutions to recognize data as a corporate asset and promote a data-driven culture within the institution. It is both strategic and timely for IMIA, as an international organization in health informatics, to take the lead to promote a data-driven culture in healthcare organizations.

This is crucial for data exchange between health information systems, epidemiological analysis, quality and research, clinical decision support systems, administrative functions, among others. Structured data entry is an obstacle for the usability of electronic health record (EHR) applications and their acceptance by physicians who prefer to document patient EHRs using \"free text\". Natural language allows for rich expressiveness but at the same time is ambiguous; it has great dependence on context and uses jargon and acronyms. Although much progress has been made in knowledge and natural language processing techniques, the result is not yet satisfactory enough for the use of free text in all dimensions of clinical documentation. In order to address the trade-off between capturing data with free text and at the same time coding data for computer processing, numerous terminological systems for the systematic recording of clinical data have been developed. The purpose of terminology services consists of representing facts that happen in the real world through database management in order to allow for semantic interoperability and computerized applications. These systems interrelate concepts of a particular domain and provide references to related terms with standards codes. In this way, standard terminologies allow the creation of a controlled medical vocabulary, making terminology services a fundamental component for health data management in the healthcare environment.

These papers were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers to allow the editorial team an enlightened selection of the best papers. Results: Among the 829 references retrieved from PubMed and Web of Science, three were finally selected as best papers. The first one compares Google, Twitter, and Wikipedia as tools for Influenza surveillance. The second paper presents a Geographic Knowledge-Based Model for mapping suitable areas for Rift Valley fever transmission in Eastern Africa.

Methods: We conducted a review of English-language research works conducted in the domain of public and population health informatics and published in MEDLINE or Web of Science between January 2015 and June 2016 where information technology or informatics was a primary subject or main component of the study methodology. Selected articles were presented using a thematic analysis based on the 2011 American Medical Informatics Association (AMIA) Public Health Informatics Agenda tracks as a typology. Results: Results are given within the context developed by Dixon et al., (2015) and key themes from the 2011 AMIA Public Health Informatics Agenda. Advances are presented within a socio-technical infrastructure undergirded by a trained, competent public health workforce, systems development to meet the business needs of the practice field, and research that evaluates whether those needs are adequately met. The ability to support and grow the infrastructure depends on financial sustainability. Conclusions: The fields of public health and population health informatics continue to grow, with the most notable developments focused on surveillance, workforce development, and linking to or providing clinical services, which encompassed population health informatics advances. Very few advances addressed the need to improve communication, coordination, and consistency with the field of informatics itself, as identified in the AMIA agenda.

Conclusion: The challenges are such that with the abundance of health administrative data, only a European, overarching public health research infrastructure, is able to efficiently facilitate access to this data and accelerate research based on these highly valuable resources.","155":"Objectives: To summarize recent research and present a selection of the best papers published in 2016 in the field of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP). Method: A survey of the literature was performed by the two section editors of the IMIA Yearbook NLP section. Bibliographic databases were searched for papers with a focus on NLP efforts applied to clinical texts or aimed at a clinical outcome. Papers were automatically ranked and then manually reviewed based on titles and abstracts. A shortlist of candidate best papers was first selected by the section editors before being peer-reviewed by independent external reviewers. Results: The five clinical NLP best papers provide a contribution that ranges from emerging original foundational methods to transitioning solid established research results to a practical clinical setting. They offer a framework for abbreviation disambiguation and coreference resolution, a classification method to identify clinically useful sentences, an analysis of counseling conversations to improve support to patients with mental disorder and grounding of gradable adjectives. Conclusions: Clinical NLP continued to thrive in 2016, with an increasing number of contributions towards applications compared to fundamental methods. Fundamental work addresses increasingly complex problems such as lexical semantics, coreference resolution, and discourse analysis. Research results translate into freely available tools, mainly for English.","156":"Background: Natural Language Processing (NLP) methods are increasingly being utilized to mine knowledge from unstructured health-related texts. Recent advances in noisy text processing techniques are enabling researchers and medical domain experts to go beyond the information encapsulated in published texts (e.g., clinical trials and systematic reviews) and structured questionnaires, and obtain perspectives from other unstructured sources such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs) and social media posts. Objectives: To review the recently published literature discussing the application of NLP techniques for mining health-related information from EHRs and social media posts. Methods: Literature review included the research published over the last five years based on searches of PubMed, conference proceedings, and the ACM Digital Library, as well as on relevant publications referenced in papers. We particularly focused on the techniques employed on EHRs and social media data. Results: A set of 62 studies involving EHRs and 87 studies involving social media matched our criteria and were included in this paper. We present the purposes of these studies, outline the key NLP contributions, and discuss the general trends observed in the field, the current state of research, and important outstanding problems. Conclusions: Over the recent years, there has been a continuing transition from lexical and rule-based systems to learning-based approaches, because of the growth of annotated data sets and advances in data science. For EHRs, publicly available annotated data is still scarce and this acts as an obstacle to research progress. On the contrary, research on social media mining has seen a rapid growth, particularly because the large amount of unlabeled data available via this resource compensates for the uncertainty inherent to the data. Effective mechanisms to filter out noise and for mapping social media expressions to standard medical concepts are crucial and latent research problems. Shared tasks and other competitive challenges have been driving factors behind the implementation of open systems, and they are likely to play an imperative role in the development of future systems.","157":"Objectives: To summarize key contributions to current research in the field of Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) and to select the best papers published in 2016. Methods: A bibliographic search using a combination of MeSH and free terms on CRI was performed using PubMed, followed by a double-blind review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. A consensus meeting between the two section editors and the editorial team was organized to finally conclude on the selection of best papers. Results: Among the 452 papers published in 2016 in the various areas of CRI and returned by the query, the full review process selected four best papers. The authors of the first paper utilized a comprehensive representation of the patient medical record and semi-automatically labeled training sets to create phenotype models via a machine learning process. The second selected paper describes an open source tool chain securely connecting ResearchKit compatible applications (Apps) to the widely-used clinical research infrastructure Informatics for Integrating Biology and the Bedside (i2b2). The third selected paper describes the FAIR Guiding Principles for scientific data management and stewardship. The fourth selected paper focuses on the evaluation of the risk of privacy breaches in releasing genomics datasets. Conclusions: A major trend in the 2016 publications is the variety of research on \"real-world data\" - healthcare-generated data, person health data, and patient-reported outcomes -highlighting the opportunities provided by new machine learning techniques as well as new potential risks of privacy breaches.","158":"Objectives: The primary goal of this review is to summarize significant developments in the field of Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) over the years 2015-2016. The secondary goal is to contribute to a deeper understanding of CRI as a field, through the development of a strategy for searching and classifying CRI publications. Methods: A search strategy was developed to query the PubMed database, using medical subject headings to both select and exclude articles, and filtering publications by date and other characteristics. A manual review classified publications using stages in the \"research study lifecycle\", with key stages that include study definition, participant enrollment, data management, data analysis, and results dissemination. Results: The search strategy generated 510 publications. The manual classification identified 125 publications as relevant to CRI, which were classified into seven different stages of the research lifecycle, and one additional class that pertained to multiple stages, referring to general infrastructure or standards. Important cross-cutting themes included new applications of electronic media (Internet, social media, mobile devices), standardization of data and procedures, and increased automation through the use of data mining and big data methods. Conclusions: The review revealed increased interest and support for CRI in large-scale projects across institutions, regionally, nationally, and internationally. A search strategy based on medical subject headings can find many relevant papers, but a large number of non-relevant papers need to be detected using text words which pertain to closely related fields such as computational statistics and clinical informatics. The research lifecycle was useful as a classification scheme by highlighting the relevance to the users of clinical research informatics solutions.","159":"Objectives: To highlight and provide insights into key developments in translational bioinformatics between 2014 and 2016. Methods: This review describes some of the most influential bioinformatics papers and resources that have been published between 2014 and 2016 as well as the national genome sequencing initiatives that utilize these resources to routinely embed genomic medicine into healthcare. Also discussed are some applications of the secondary use of patient data followed by a comprehensive view of the open challenges and emergent technologies. Results: Although data generation can be performed routinely, analyses and data integration methods still require active research and standardization to improve streamlining of clinical interpretation. The secondary use of patient data has resulted in the development of novel algorithms and has enabled a refined understanding of cellular and phenotypic mechanisms. New data storage and data sharing approaches are required to enable diverse biomedical communities to contribute to genomic discovery. Conclusion: The translation of genomics data into actionable knowledge for use in healthcare is transforming the clinical landscape in an unprecedented way. Exciting and innovative models that bridge the gap between clinical and academic research are set to open up the field of translational bioinformatics for rapid growth in a digital era.","160":"Objective: To summarize the state of the art during the year 2016 in the areas related to consumer health informatics and education with a special emphasis in secondary use of patient data. Methods: We conducted a systematic review of articles published in 2016, using PubMed with a predefined set of queries. We identified over 320 potential articles for review. Papers were considered according to their relevance for the topic of the section. Using consensus, we selected the 15 most representative papers, which were submitted to external reviewers for full review and scoring. Based on the scoring and quality criteria, five papers were finally selected as best papers Results: The five best papers can be grouped in two major areas: 1) methods and tools to identify and collect formal requirements for secondary use of data, and 2) innovative topics highlighting the interest of carrying on \"secondary\" studies on patient data, more specifically on the data self-expressed by patients through social media tools. Regarding the formal requirements about informed consent, the selected papers report a comparison of legal aspects in European countries to find a common and unified grammar around the concept of \"data donation\". Regarding innovative approaches to value patient data, the selected papers report machine learning algorithms to extract knowledge from patient experience and satisfaction with health care delivery, drug and medication use, treatment compliance and barriers during cancer disease, or acceptation of public health actions such as vaccination. Conclusions: Secondary use of patient data (apart from personal health care record data) can be expressed according to many ways. Requirements to allow this secondary use have to be harmonized between countries, and social media platforms can be efficiently used to explore and create knowledge on patient experience with health problems or activities. Machine learning algorithms can explore those massive amounts of data to support health care professionals, and institutions provide more accurate knowledge about use and usage, behaviour, sentiment, or satisfaction about health care delivery.","161":"Objectives: Consumer Health Informatics (CHI) and the use of Patient-Generated Health Data (PGHD) are rapidly growing focus areas in healthcare. The objective of this paper is to briefly review the literature that has been published over the past few years and to provide a sense of where the field is going. Methods: We searched PubMed and the ACM Digital Library for articles published between 2014 and 2016 on the topics of CHI and PGHD. The results of the search were screened for relevance and categorized into a set of common themes. We discuss the major topics covered in these articles. Results: We retrieved 65 articles from our PubMed query and 32 articles from our ACM Digital Library query. After a review of titles, we were left with 47 articles to conduct our full article survey of the activities in CHI and PGHD. We have summarized these articles and placed them into major categories of activity. Within the domain of consumer health informatics, articles focused on mobile health and patient-generated health data comprise the majority of the articles published in recent years. Conclusions: Current evidence indicates that technological advancements and the widespread availability of affordable consumer-grade devices are fueling research into using PGHD for better care. As we observe a growing number of (pilot) developments using various mobile health technologies to collect PGHD, major gaps still exist in how to use the data by both patients and providers. Further research is needed to understand the impact of PGHD on clinical outcomes.","162":"Objectives: To select, present, and summarize the best papers published in 2016 in the field of Knowledge Representation and Management (KRM). Methods: A comprehensive and standardized review of the medical informatics literature was performed based on a PubMed query. Results: Among the 1,421 retrieved papers, the review process resulted in the selection of four best papers focused on the integration of heterogeneous data via the development and the alignment of terminological resources. In the first article, the authors provide a curated and standardized version of the publicly available US FDA Adverse Event Reporting System. Such a resource will improve the quality of the underlying data, and enable standardized analyses using common vocabularies. The second article describes a project developed in order to facilitate heterogeneous data integration in the i2b2 framework. The originality is to allow users integrate the data described in different terminologies and to build a new repository, with a unique model able to support the representation of the various data. The third paper is dedicated to model the association between multiple phenotypic traits described within the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO) and the corresponding genotype in the specific context of rare diseases (rare variants). Finally, the fourth paper presents solutions to annotation-ontology mapping in genome-scale data. Of particular interest in this work is the Experimental Factor Ontology (EFO) and its generic association model, the Ontology of Biomedical AssociatioN (OBAN). Conclusion: Ontologies have started to show their efficiency to integrate medical data for various tasks in medical informatics: electronic health records data management, clinical research, and knowledge-based systems development.","163":"Objectives: Electronic health records (EHRs) have increasingly emerged as a powerful source of clinical data that can be leveraged for reuse in research and in modular health apps that integrate into diverse health information technologies. A key challenge to these use cases is representing the knowledge contained within data from different EHR systems in a uniform fashion. Method: We reviewed several recent studies covering the knowledge representation in the common data models for the Observational Medical Outcomes Partnership (OMOP) and its Observational Health Data Sciences and Informatics program, and the United States Patient Centered Outcomes Research Network (PCORNet). We also reviewed the Health Level 7 Fast Healthcare Interoperability Resource standard supporting app-like programs that can be used across multiple EHR and research systems. Results: There has been a recent growth in high-impact efforts to support quality-assured and standardized clinical data sharing across different institutions and EHR systems. We focused on three major efforts as part of a larger landscape moving towards shareable, transportable, and computable clinical data. Conclusion: The growth in approaches to developing common data models to support interoperable knowledge representation portends an increasing availability of high-quality clinical data in support of research. Building on these efforts will allow a future whereby significant portions of the populations in the world may be able to share their data for research.","164":"Objectives: To summarize recent research and select the best papers published in 2016 in the field of computerized clinical decision support for the Decision Support section of the IMIA yearbook. Methods: A literature review was performed by searching two bibliographic databases for papers related to clinical decision support systems (CDSSs). The aim was to identify a list of candidate best papers from the retrieved papers that were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. A consensus meeting of the IMIA editorial team finally selected the best papers on the basis of all reviews and section editor evaluation. Results: Among the 1,145 retrieved papers, the entire review process resulted in the selection of four best papers. The first paper describes machine learning models used to predict breast cancer multidisciplinary team decisions and compares them with two predictors based on guideline knowledge. The second paper introduces a linked-data approach for publication, discovery, and interoperability of CDSSs. The third paper assessed the variation in high-priority drug-drug interaction (DDI) alerts across 14 Electronic Health Record systems, operating in different institutions in the US. The fourth paper proposes a generic framework for modeling multiple concurrent guidelines and detecting their recommendation interactions using semantic web technologies. Conclusions: The process of identifying and selecting best papers in the domain of CDSSs demonstrated that the research in this field is very active concerning diverse dimensions, such as the types of CDSSs, e.g. guideline-based, machine-learning-based, knowledge-fusion-based, etc., and addresses challenging areas, such as the concurrent application of multiple guidelines for comorbid patients, the resolution of interoperability issues, and the evaluation of CDSSs. Nevertheless, this process also showed that CDSSs are not yet fully part of the digitalized healthcare ecosystem. Many challenges remain to be faced with regard to the evidence of their output, the dissemination of their technologies, as well as their adoption for better and safer healthcare delivery.","165":"Introduction: Advances in clinical decision support (CDS) continue to evolve to support the goals of clinicians, policymakers, patients and professional organizations to improve clinical practice, patient safety, and the quality of care. Objectives: Identify key thematic areas or foci in research and practice involving clinical decision support during the 2015-2016 time period. Methods: Thematic analysis consistent with a grounded theory approach was applied in a targeted review of journal publications, the proceedings of key scientific conferences as well as activities in standards development organizations in order to identify the key themes underlying work related to CDS. Results: Ten key thematic areas were identified, including: 1) an emphasis on knowledge representation, with a focus on clinical practice guidelines; 2) various aspects of precision medicine, including the use of sensor and genomic data as well as big data; 3) efforts in quality improvement; 4) innovative uses of computer-based provider order entry (CPOE) systems, including relevant data displays; 5) expansion of CDS in various clinical settings; 6) patient-directed CDS; 7) understanding the potential negative impact of CDS; 8) obtaining structured data to drive CDS interventions; 9) the use of diagnostic decision support; and 10) the development and use of standards for CDS. Conclusions: Active research and practice in 2015-2016 continue to underscore the importance and broad utility of CDS for effecting change and improving the quality and outcome of clinical care.","166":null,"167":"Objectives: Precision medicine requires the measurement, quantification, and cataloging of medical characteristics to identify the most effective medical intervention. However, the amount of available data exceeds our current capacity to extract meaningful information. We examine the informatics needs to achieve precision medicine from the perspective of quantitative imaging and oncology. Methods: The National Cancer Institute (NCI) organized several workshops on the topic of medical imaging and precision medicine. The observations and recommendations are summarized herein. Results: Recommendations include: use of standards in data collection and clinical correlates to promote interoperability; data sharing and validation of imaging tools; clinician's feedback in all phases of research and development; use of open-source architecture to encourage reproducibility and reusability; use of challenges which simulate real-world situations to incentivize innovation; partnership with industry to facilitate commercialization; and education in academic communities regarding the challenges involved with translation of technology from the research domain to clinical utility and the benefits of doing so. Conclusions: This article provides a survey of the role and priorities for imaging informatics to help advance quantitative imaging in the era of precision medicine. While these recommendations were drawn from oncology, they are relevant and applicable to other clinical domains where imaging aids precision medicine.","168":"Objective: To summarize recent research and to propose a selection of best papers published in 2016 in the field of Clinical Information Systems (CIS). Method: The query used to retrieve the articles for the CIS section of the 2016 edition of the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics was reused. It again aimed at identifying relevant publications in the field of CIS from PubMed and Web of Science and comprised search terms from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) catalog as well as additional free text search terms. The retrieved articles were categorized in a multi-pass review carried out by the two section editors. The final selection of candidate papers was then peer-reviewed by Yearbook editors and external reviewers. Based on the review results, the best papers were then chosen at the selection meeting with the IMIA Yearbook editorial board. Text mining, term co-occurrence mapping, and topic modelling techniques were used to get an overview on the content of the retrieved articles. Results: The query was carried out in mid-January 2017, yielding a consolidated result set of 2,190 articles published in 921 different journals. Out of them, 14 papers were nominated as candidate best papers and three of them were finally selected as the best papers of the CIS field. The content analysis of the articles revealed the broad spectrum of topics covered by CIS research. Conclusions: The CIS field is multi-dimensional and complex. It is hard to draw a well-defined outline between CIS and other domains or other sections of the IMIA Yearbook. The trends observed in the previous years are progressing. Clinical information systems are more than just sociotechnical systems for data collection, processing, exchange, presentation, and archiving. They are the backbone of a complex, trans-institutional information logistics process.","169":"Objectives: Although patients may have a wealth of imaging, genomic, monitoring, and personal device data, it has yet to be fully integrated into clinical care. Methods: We identify three reasons for the lack of integration. The first is that \"Big Data\" is poorly managed by most Electronic Medical Record Systems (EMRS). The data is mostly available on \"cloud-native\" platforms that are outside the scope of most EMRs, and even checking if such data is available on a patient often must be done outside the EMRS. The second reason is that extracting features from the Big Data that are relevant to healthcare often requires complex machine learning algorithms, such as determining if a genomic variant is protein-altering. The third reason is that applications that present Big Data need to be modified constantly to reflect the current state of knowledge, such as instructing when to order a new set of genomic tests. In some cases, applications need to be updated nightly. Results: A new architecture for EMRS is evolving which could unite Big Data, machine learning, and clinical care through a microservice-based architecture which can host applications focused on quite specific aspects of clinical care, such as managing cancer immunotherapy. Conclusion: Informatics innovation, medical research, and clinical care go hand in hand as we look to infuse science-based practice into healthcare. Innovative methods will lead to a new ecosystem of applications (Apps) interacting with healthcare providers to fulfill a promise that is still to be determined.","170":null,"171":null,"172":"Objectives: To summarize the recent literature and research and present a selection of the best papers published in 2016 in the field of Health Information Management (HIM). Methods: A systematic review of the literature for the IMIA Yearbook HIM section was performed by the two section editors with the help of a medical librarian. We searched bibliographic databases for HIM-related papers were searched using both MeSH headings and key words in titles and abstracts. A shortlist of candidate best papers was first selected by section editors before being peer-reviewed by independent external reviewers. Results: The five papers selected as 'Best Papers' illustrate a variety of themes, include authors from a variety of countries, and were published in some of the best journals in the field. The themes of the five best papers include health information exchange, personal health records, patient engagement, data quality, and e-quality measures. Conclusions: The discipline of Health Information Management is increasingly becoming allied with the field of Biomedical Informatics in that both disciplines have interests in common. Traditional HIM areas of expertise (in the pre-electronic health record world), such as coding and privacy and security of health information, are necessary for the electronic exchange and secondary use of health information. With the changes in healthcare delivery brought by the use of electronic health records, addressing issues of information governance is essential. This synopsis discusses these key issues at the intersection of HIM and informatics, examines the potential challenges, and points the way for best practices, future research, and public policy considerations and directions.","173":"Objective: With the evolution of patient medical records from paper to electronic media and the changes to the way data is sourced, used, and managed, there is an opportunity for health information management (HIM) to learn and facilitate the increasing expanse of available patient data. Methods: This paper discusses the emerging trends and lessons learnt in relation with the following four areas: 1) data and information governance, 2) terminology standards certification, 3) International Classification of Diseases, 11th edition (ICD-11), and 4) data analytics and HIM. Results: The governance of patient data and information increasingly requires the HIM profession to incorporate the roles of data scientists and data stewards into its portfolio to ensure data analytics and digital transformation is appropriately managed. Not only are terminology standards required to facilitate the structure and primary use of this data, developments in Canada in relation with the standards, role descriptions, framework and curricula in the form of certification provide one prime example of ensuring the quality of the secondary use of patient data. The impending introduction of ICD-11 brings with it the need for the HIM profession to manage the transition between ICD versions and country modifications incorporating changes to standards and tools, and the availability and type of patient data available for secondary use. Conclusions: In summary, the health information management profession now requires abilities in leadership, data, and informatics in addition to health information science and coding skills to facilitate the expanding secondary use of patient data.","174":"Objectives: To summarize recent research and emerging trends in the area of secondary use of healthcare data, and to present the best papers published in this field, selected to appear in the 2017 edition of the IMIA Yearbook. Methods: A literature review of articles published in 2016 and related to secondary use of healthcare data was performed using two bibliographic databases. From this search, 941 papers were identified. The section editors independently reviewed the papers for relevancy and impact, resulting in a consensus list of 14 candidate best papers. External reviewers examined each of the candidate best papers and the final selection was made by the editorial board of the Yearbook. Results: From the 941 retrieved papers, the selection process resulted in four best papers. These papers discuss data quality concerns, issues in preserving privacy of patients in shared datasets, and methods of decision support when consuming large amounts of raw electronic health record (EHR) data. Conclusion: In 2016, a significant effort was put into the development of new systems which aim to avoid significant human understanding and pre-processing of healthcare data, though this is still only an emerging area of research. The value of temporal relationships between data received significant study, as did effective information sharing while preserving patient privacy.","175":"Objective: Reuse of clinical data has broad use in clinical, research, governmental, and business settings. This summary provides an update on the benefits, barriers to use with large clinical databases, policy frameworks that have been formulated, and challenges. Methods: This report highlights some recent publications on the diverse uses of clinical data and some policy initiatives to promote reuse. It also contains the opinions of the author. Results: Although many examples of the benefits of data reuse have been documented, this summary also reviews why the quality of clinical data needs to be the focus of future informatics work. Conclusion: The promise of reusing data outweighs potential risks, but concerns about privacy and the need to modernize our legal framework will be necessary to realize the full benefits of real-world evidence.","176":"","177":"Objectives: To provide an introduction to the 2017 IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics by the editors. Methods: We present a brief overview of the 2017 special topic \"Learning from experience: Secondary use of patient data\". We review our choice of special topic section editors, present the new section \"Health Information Management\", and discuss transitions in the editorial team. Results: In this edition of the Yearbook, we focused on one of the most important issues for the medical informatics community: The secondary use of clinical data. With the ubiquitous adoption of electronic health records (EHRs) and the increasing availability of genomic and environmental data, as well as the accessibility of unstructured data in social media, issues related to data integration, storage, and management, as well as the need for novel analytic approaches are clear challenges. The paradigm of Learning Health Systems (LHSs) is presented in the keynote paper and survey papers review the significant developments in allied fields such as clinical research, clinical systems, translational informatics, and public health over the past two years. IMIA Working Groups also contributed to this topic. Conclusion: The 2017 issue of the IMIA yearbook focuses on the secondary use of patient data and presents the difficulties that still need to be solved before witnessing the actual development of LHSs.","178":"","179":null,"180":"Objectives: The educational activities initiated by the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) have had global impacts and influenced national societies and local academic programs in the field of Biomedical and Health Informatics (BMHI). After the successful publication and dissemination of its educational recommendations, IMIA launched an accreditation procedure for educational programs in BMHI. The accreditation procedure was pilot tested by several BMHI academic programs in different countries and continents to obtain a global perspective. Methods: This paper presents an overview of IMIA quality assurance and accreditation procedures along with feedback on issues and problems which emerged during the pilot. Results: It appears that IMIA quality assurance and procedures worked quite well in different countries of Europe, the Middle East, South America, and Asia. These first experiences provided adequate information for adapting, modifying, and optimizing the procedures and finally for the planning of future activities. Conclusions: IMIA accreditation framework comprises a single set of standards that apply at various levels to both academic and professional BMHI programs. The pilot phase confirmed the robustness and generalizability of quality assurance standards and associated procedures on which IMIA accreditation is based at an international level.","181":"Objectives: To set the scientific context and then suggest principles for an evidence-based approach to secondary uses of clinical data, covering both evaluation of the secondary uses of data and evaluation of health systems and services based upon secondary uses of data. Method: Working Group review of selected literature and policy approaches. Results: We present important considerations in the evaluation of secondary uses of clinical data from the angles of governance and trust, theory, semantics, and policy. We make the case for a multi-level and multi-factorial approach to the evaluation of secondary uses of clinical data and describe a methodological framework for best practice. We emphasise the importance of evaluating the governance of secondary uses of health data in maintaining trust, which is essential for such uses. We also offer examples of the re-use of routine health data to demonstrate how it can support evaluation of clinical performance and optimize health IT system design. Conclusions: Great expectations are resting upon \"Big Data\" and innovative analytics. However, to build and maintain public trust, improve data reliability, and assure the validity of analytic inferences, there must be independent and transparent evaluation. A mature and evidence-based approach needs not merely data science, but must be guided by the broader concerns of applied health informatics.","182":"Objective: To give an overview of the role of Free\/Libre and Open Source Software (FLOSS) in the context of secondary use of patient data to enable Learning Health Systems (LHSs). Methods: We conducted an environmental scan of the academic and grey literature utilising the MedFLOSS database of open source systems in healthcare to inform a discussion of the role of open source in developing LHSs that reuse patient data for research and quality improvement. Results: A wide range of FLOSS is identified that contributes to the information technology (IT) infrastructure of LHSs including operating systems, databases, frameworks, interoperability software, and mobile and web apps. The recent literature around the development and use of key clinical data management tools is also reviewed. Conclusions: FLOSS already plays a critical role in modern health IT infrastructure for the collection, storage, and analysis of patient data. The nature of FLOSS systems to be collaborative, modular, and modifiable may make open source approaches appropriate for building the digital infrastructure for a LHS.","183":"Objective: To perform a review of recent research in clinical data reuse or secondary use, and envision future advances in this field. Methods: The review is based on a large literature search in MEDLINE (through PubMed), conference proceedings, and the ACM Digital Library, focusing only on research published between 2005 and early 2016. Each selected publication was reviewed by the authors, and a structured analysis and summarization of its content was developed. Results: The initial search produced 359 publications, reduced after a manual examination of abstracts and full publications. The following aspects of clinical data reuse are discussed: motivations and challenges, privacy and ethical concerns, data integration and interoperability, data models and terminologies, unstructured data reuse, structured data mining, clinical practice and research integration, and examples of clinical data reuse (quality measurement and learning healthcare systems). Conclusion: Reuse of clinical data is a fast-growing field recognized as essential to realize the potentials for high quality healthcare, improved healthcare management, reduced healthcare costs, population health management, and effective clinical research.","184":"Objectives: To identify common methodological challenges and review relevant initiatives related to the re-use of patient data collected in routine clinical care, as well as to analyze the economic benefits derived from the secondary use of this data. Through the use of several examples, this article aims to provide a glimpse into the different areas of application, namely clinical research, genomic research, study of environmental factors, and population and health services research. This paper describes some of the informatics methods and Big Data resources developed in this context, such as electronic phenotyping, clinical research networks, biorepositories, screening data banks, and wide association studies. Lastly, some of the potential limitations of these approaches are discussed, focusing on confounding factors and data quality. Methods: A series of literature searches in main bibliographic databases have been conducted in order to assess the extent to which existing patient data has been repurposed for research. This contribution from the IMIA working group on \"Data mining and Big Data analytics\" focuses on the literature published during the last two years, covering the timeframe since the working group's last survey. Results and Conclusions: Although most of the examples of secondary use of patient data lie in the arena of clinical and health services research, we have started to witness other important applications, particularly in the area of genomic research and the study of health effects of environmental factors. Further research is needed to characterize the economic impact of secondary use across the broad spectrum of translational research.","185":null,"186":"Introduction: Various health-related data, subsequently called Person Generated Health Data (PGHD), is being collected by patients or presumably healthy individuals as well as about them as much as they become available as measurable properties in their work, home, and other environments. Despite that such data was originally just collected and used for dedicated predefined purposes, more recently it is regarded as untapped resources that call for secondary use. Method: Since the secondary use of PGHD is still at its early evolving stage, we have chosen, in this paper, to produce an outline of best practices, as opposed to a systematic review. To this end, we identified key directions of secondary use and invited protagonists of each of these directions to present their takes on the primary and secondary use of PGHD in their sub-fields. We then put secondary use in a wider perspective of overarching themes such as privacy, interpretability, interoperability, utility, and ethics. Results: We present the primary and secondary use of PGHD in four focus areas: (1) making sense of PGHD in augmented Shared Care Plans for care coordination across multiple conditions; (2) making sense of PGHD from patient-held sensors to inform cancer care; (3) fitting situational use of PGHD to evaluate personal informatics tools in adaptive concurrent trials; (4) making sense of environment risk exposure data in an integrated context with clinical and omics-data for biomedical research. Discussion: Fast technological progress in all the four focus areas calls for a societal debate and decision-making process on a multitude of challenges: how emerging or foreseeable results transform privacy; how new data modalities can be interpreted in light of clinical data and vice versa; how the sheer mass and partially abstract mathematical properties of the achieved insights can be interpreted to a broad public and can consequently facilitate the development of patient-centered services; and how the remaining risks and uncertainties can be evaluated against new benefits. This paper is an initial summary of the status quo of the challenges and proposals that address these issues. The opportunities and barriers identified can serve as action items individuals can bring to their organizations when facing challenges to add value from the secondary use of patient-generated health data.","187":"Background: The Institute of Medicine framework defines six dimensions of quality for healthcare systems: (1) safety, (2) effectiveness, (3) patient centeredness, (4) timeliness of care, (5) efficiency, and (6) equity. Large health datasets provide an opportunity to assess quality in these areas. Objective: To perform an international comparison of the measurability of the delivery of these aims, in people with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T2DM) from large datasets. Method: We conducted a survey to assess healthcare outcomes data quality of existing databases and disseminated this through professional networks. We examined the data sources used to collect the data, frequency of data uploads, and data types used for identifying people with T2DM. We compared data completeness across the six areas of healthcare quality, using selected measures pertinent to T2DM management. Results: We received 14 responses from seven countries (Australia, Canada, Italy, the Netherlands, Norway, Portugal, Turkey and the UK). Most databases reported frequent data uploads and would be capable of near real time analysis of healthcare quality.The majority of recorded data related to safety (particularly medication adverse events) and treatment efficacy (glycaemic control and microvascular disease). Data potentially measuring equity was less well recorded. Recording levels were lowest for patient-centred care, timeliness of care, and system efficiency, with the majority of databases containing no data in these areas. Databases using primary care sources had higher data quality across all areas measured. Conclusion: Data quality could be improved particularly in the areas of patient-centred care, timeliness, and efficiency. Primary care derived datasets may be most suited to healthcare quality assessment.","188":"May 1st, 2017, will mark Dieter Bergemann's 80th birthday. As Chief Executive Officer and Owner of Schattauer Publishers from 1983 to 2016, the biomedical and health informatics community owes him a great debt of gratitude. The past and present editors of Methods of Information in Medicine, the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics, and Applied Clinical Informatics want to honour and thank Dieter Bergemann by providing a brief biography that emphasizes his contributions, by reviewing his critical role as an exceptionally supportive publisher for Schattauer's three biomedical and health informatics periodicals, and by sharing some personal anecdotes. Over the past 40 years, Dieter Bergemann has been an influential, if behind-the-scenes, driving force in biomedical and health informatics publications, helping to ensure success in the dissemination of our field's research and practice.","189":"Profound global challenges to individual and population health, alongside the opportunities to benefit from digital technology, have spawned the concept of the Learning Health System. Learning Health Systems (LHSs)--which can function at organizational, network, regional, and national levels of scale--have the capability of continuous data-driven self-study that promotes change and improvement. The LHS concept, which originated in the U.S. in 2007, is rapidly gaining attention around the world. LHSs require, but also transcend, the secondary use of health data. This paper describes the key features of LHSs, argues that effective and sustainable LHSs must be supported by infrastructures that allow them to function with economies of scale and scope, and describes the services that such infrastructures must provide. While it is relatively straightforward to describe LHSs, achieving them at the high level of capability necessary to promote significant health benefits will require advancements in science and engineering, engaging the field of informatics among a wider range of disciplines. It also follows from this vision that LHSs cannot be built from an imposed blueprint; LHSs will more likely evolve from efforts at smaller scales that compose into larger systems.","190":"Official recognition and certification for informatics professionals are essential aspects of workforce development. To describe the history, pathways, and nuances of certification in nursing informatics across the globe; compare and contrast those with board certification in clinical informatics for physicians. (1) A review of the representative literature on informatics certification and related competencies for nurses and physicians, and relevant websites for nursing informatics associations and societies worldwide; (2) similarities and differences between certification processes for nurses and physicians, and (3) perspectives on roles for nursing informatics professionals in healthcare Results: The literature search for 'nursing informatics certification' yielded few results in PubMed; Google Scholar yielded a large number of citations that extended to magazines and other non-peer reviewed sources. Worldwide, there are several nursing informatics associations, societies, and workgroups dedicated to nursing informatics associated with medical\/health informatics societies. A formal certification program for nursing informatics appears to be available only in the United States. This certification was established in 1992, in concert with the formation and definition of nursing informatics as a specialty practice of nursing by the American Nurses Association. Although informatics is inherently interprofessional, certification pathways for nurses and physicians have developed separately, following long-standing professional structures, training, and pathways aligned with clinical licensure and direct patient care. There is substantial similarity with regard to the skills and competencies required for nurses and physicians to obtain informatics certification in their respective fields. Nurses may apply for and complete a certification examination if they have experience in the field, regardless of formal training. Increasing numbers of informatics nurses are pursuing certification. The pathway to certification is clear and wellestablished for U.S. based informatics nurses. The motivation for obtaining and maintaining nursing informatics certification appears to be stronger for nurses who do not have an advanced informatics degree. The primary difference between nursing and physician certification pathways relates to the requirement of formal training and level of informatics practice. Nurse informatics certification requires no formal education or training and verifies knowledge and skill at a more basic level. Physician informatics certification validates informatics knowledge and skill at a more advanced level; currently this requires documentation of practice and experience in clinical informatics and in the future will require successful completion of an accredited two-year fellowship in clinical informatics. For the profession of nursing, a graduate degree in nursing or biomedical informatics validates specialty knowledge at a level more comparable to the physician certification. As the field of informatics and its professional organization structures mature, a common certification pathway may be appropriate. Nurses, physicians, and other healthcare professionals with informatics training and certification are needed to contribute their expertise in clinical operations, teaching, research, and executive leadership.

Unanticipated challenges arise frequently and unanticipated consequences may follow. Working from first principles, to understand why information technology (IT) is often challenging, identify which IT endeavors are more likely to succeed, and predict the best role that technology can play in different tasks and settings. The fundamental purpose of IT is to enhance our ability to undertake tasks, supplying new information that changes what we decide and ultimately what occurs in the world. The value of this information (VOI) can be calculated at different stages of the decision-making process and will vary depending on how technology is used. We can imagine a task space that describes the relative benefits of task completion by humans or computers and that contains specific areas where humans or computers are superior. There is a third area where neither is strong and a final joint workspace where humans and computers working in partnership produce the best results. By understanding that information has value and that VOI can be quantified, we can make decisions about how best to support the work we do. Evaluation of the expected utility of task completion by humans or computers should allow us to decide whether solutions should depend on technology, humans, or a partnership between the two.

The complete 2015 literature concerning public health and epidemiology informatics has been searched in PubMed and Web of Science, and the returned references were reviewed by the two section editors to select 14 candidate best papers. These papers were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers to allow the editorial team an enlightened selection of the best papers. Among the 1,272 references retrieved from PubMed and Web of Science, three were finally selected as best papers. The first one presents a language agnostic approach for epidemic event detection in news articles. The second paper describes a system using big health data gathered by a statewide system to forecast emergency department visits. The last paper proposes a rather original approach that uses machine learning to solve the old issue of outbreak detection and prediction. The increasing availability of data, now directly from health systems, will probably lead to a boom in public health surveillance systems and in large-scale epidemiologic studies. ","194":"The aim of this manuscript is to provide a brief overview of the scientific challenges that should be addressed in order to unlock the full potential of using data from a general point of view, as well as to present some ideas that could help answer specific needs for data understanding in the field of health sciences and epidemiology. A survey of uses and challenges of big data analyses for medicine and public health was conducted. The first part of the paper focuses on big data techniques, algorithms, and statistical approaches to identify patterns in data. The second part describes some cutting-edge applications of analyses and predictive modeling in public health. In recent years, we witnessed a revolution regarding the nature, collection, and availability of data in general. This was especially striking in the health sector and particularly in the field of epidemiology. Data derives from a large variety of sources, e.g. clinical settings, billing claims, care scheduling, drug usage, web based search queries, and Tweets. The exploitation of the information (data mining, artificial intelligence) relevant to these data has become one of the most promising as well challenging tasks from societal and scientific viewpoints in order to leverage the information available and making public health more efficient. ","195":"To summarize recent research and present a selection of the best papers published in 2015 in the field of clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP). A systematic review of the literature was performed by the two section editors of the IMIA Yearbook NLP section by searching bibliographic databases with a focus on NLP efforts applied to clinical texts or aimed at a clinical outcome. Section editors first selected a shortlist of candidate best papers that were then peer-reviewed by independent external reviewers. The clinical NLP best paper selection shows that clinical NLP is making use of a variety of texts of clinical interest to contribute to the analysis of clinical information and the building of a body of clinical knowledge. The full review process highlighted five papers analyzing patient-authored texts or seeking to connect and aggregate multiple sources of information. They provide a contribution to the development of methods, resources, applications, and sometimes a combination of these aspects. The field of clinical NLP continues to thrive through the contributions of both NLP researchers and healthcare professionals interested in applying NLP techniques to impact clinical practice. Foundational progress in the field makes it possible to leverage a larger variety of texts of clinical interest for healthcare purposes. ","196":"This paper reviews work over the past two years in Natural Language Processing (NLP) applied to clinical and consumer-generated texts. We included any application or methodological publication that leverages text to facilitate healthcare and address the health-related needs of consumers and populations. Many important developments in clinical text processing, both foundational and task-oriented, were addressed in community- wide evaluations and discussed in corresponding special issues that are referenced in this review. These focused issues and in-depth reviews of several other active research areas, such as pharmacovigilance and summarization, allowed us to discuss in greater depth disease modeling and predictive analytics using clinical texts, and text analysis in social media for healthcare quality assessment, trends towards online interventions based on rapid analysis of health-related posts, and consumer health question answering, among other issues. Our analysis shows that although clinical NLP continues to advance towards practical applications and more NLP methods are used in large-scale live health information applications, more needs to be done to make NLP use in clinical applications a routine widespread reality. Progress in clinical NLP is mirrored by developments in social media text analysis: the research is moving from capturing trends to addressing individual health-related posts, thus showing potential to become a tool for precision medicine and a valuable addition to the standard healthcare quality evaluation tools.

A bibliographic search using a combination of MeSH and free terms search over PubMed on Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) was performed followed by a double-blind review in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. A consensus meeting between the two section editors and the editorial team was finally organized to conclude on the selection of best papers. Among the 579 returned papers published in the past year in the various areas of Clinical Research Informatics (CRI) - i) methods supporting clinical research, ii) data sharing and interoperability, iii) re-use of healthcare data for research, iv) patient recruitment and engagement, v) data privacy, security and regulatory issues and vi) policy and perspectives - the full review process selected four best papers. The first selected paper evaluates the capability of the Clinical Data Interchange Standards Consortium (CDISC) Operational Data Model (ODM) to support the representation of case report forms (in both the design stage and with patient level data) during a complete clinical study lifecycle. The second selected paper describes a prototype for secondary use of electronic health records data captured in non-standardized text. The third selected paper presents a privacy preserving electronic health record linkage tool and the last selected paper describes how big data use in US relies on access to health information governed by varying and often misunderstood legal requirements and ethical considerations. A major trend in the 2015 publications is the analysis of observational, \"nonexperimental\" information and the potential biases and confounding factors hidden in the data that will have to be carefully taken into account to validate new predictive models. In addiction, researchers have to understand complicated and sometimes contradictory legal requirements and to consider ethical obligations in order to balance privacy and promoting discovery.

We selected key publications that highlight not only important recent advances in CRI but also notable events likely to have significant impact on CRI activities over the next few years or longer, and consulted the discussions in relevant scientific communities and an online living textbook for modern clinical trials. We also related the new concepts with old problems to improve the continuity of CRI research. The highlights in CRI in 2015 include the growing adoption of electronic health records (EHR), the rapid development of regional, national, and global clinical data research networks for using EHR data to integrate scalable clinical research with clinical care and generate robust medical evidence. Data quality, integration, and fusion, data access by researchers, study transparency, results reproducibility, and infrastructure sustainability are persistent challenges.

We provide a synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2016, from which we attempt to derive a synthetic overview of current and future activities in the field. As last year, a first step of selection was performed by querying MEDLINE with a list of MeSH descriptors completed by a list of terms adapted to the section. Each section editor has evaluated separately the set of 1,566 articles and the evaluation results were merged for retaining 14 articles for peer-review. The selection and evaluation process of this Yearbook's section on Bioinformatics and Translational Informatics yielded four excellent articles focusing this year on data management of large-scale datasets and genomic medicine that are mainly new method-based papers. Three articles explore the high potential of the re-analysis of previously collected data, here from The Cancer Genome Atlas project (TCGA) and one article presents an original analysis of genomic data from sub-Saharan Africa populations. The current research activities in Bioinformatics and Translational Informatics with application in the health domain continues to explore new algorithms and statistical models to manage and interpret large-scale genomic datasets. From population wide genome sequencing for cataloging genomic variants to the comprehension of functional impact on pathways and molecular interactions regarding a given pathology, making sense of large genomic data requires a necessary effort to address the issue of clinical translation for precise diagnostic and personalized medicine.

We conducted a systematic review of articles published in PubMed with a predefined set of queries, which lead to the selection of over 700 potential relevant articles. Section editors screened those papers on the title, abstract, and finally complete paper basis, taking into account the papers' relevance for the section topic. The 15 most representative papers were finally selected by consensus between the two section editors and submitted for full review and scoring to external reviewers and the yearbook editors. Based on the final scoring, section editors selected the best five papers. The five best papers can be grouped in two major areas: 1) Digital health literacy and 2) Quality and safety concerns. Regarding health literacy issues of patients with chronic conditions such as asthma, online interventions should rather focus on changing patient beliefs about the disease than on supporting them in the management of their pathology since personally controlled health management systems do not show expected benefits,. Nevertheless, encouraging and training chronic patients for an active online health information-seeking behaviour substantially decreases state anxiety level. Regarding safety and privacy issues, even recommended health-related apps available on mobile phones do not guarantee personal data protection. Furthermore, the analysis indicated that patients undergoing Internet interventions experienced at least one adverse event that might be related to treatment. At least, predictive factors have been identified in order to credit or not a health rumour. Trusting digital and connected health can be achieved if patients, health care professionals, and industrials build a shared model of health data management integrating ethics rules. Only increasing efforts in education with regards of digital health would help reach this goal., This would not resolve all frauds and security issues but at least improve their detection. ","202":"To summarize excellent current research in the field of Knowledge Representation and Management (KRM) within the health and medical care domain. We provide a synopsis of the 2016 IMIA selected articles as well as a related synthetic overview of the current and future field activities. A first step of the selection was performed through MEDLINE querying with a list of MeSH descriptors completed by a list of terms adapted to the KRM section. The second step of the selection was completed by the two section editors who separately evaluated the set of 1,432 articles. The third step of the selection consisted of a collective work that merged the evaluation results to retain 15 articles for peer-review. The selection and evaluation process of this Yearbook's section on Knowledge Representation and Management has yielded four excellent and interesting articles regarding semantic interoperability for health care by gathering heterogeneous sources (knowledge and data) and auditing ontologies. In the first article, the authors present a solution based on standards and Semantic Web technologies to access distributed and heterogeneous datasets in the domain of breast cancer clinical trials. The second article describes a knowledge-based recommendation system that relies on ontologies and Semantic Web rules in the context of chronic diseases dietary. The third article is related to concept-recognition and text-mining to derive common human diseases model and a phenotypic network of common diseases. In the fourth article, the authors highlight the need for auditing the SNOMED CT. They propose to use a crowdbased method for ontology engineering. The current research activities further illustrate the continuous convergence of Knowledge Representation and Medical Informatics, with a focus this year on dedicated tools and methods to advance clinical care by proposing solutions to cope with the problem of semantic interoperability. Indeed, there is a need for powerful tools able to manage and interpret complex, large-scale and distributed datasets and knowledge bases, but also a need for user-friendly tools developed for the clinicians in their daily practice. ","203":"Biomedical research is increasingly becoming a data-intensive science in several areas, where prodigious amounts of data is being generated that has to be stored, integrated, shared and analyzed. In an effort to improve the accessibility of data and knowledge, the Linked Data initiative proposed a well-defined set of recommendations for exposing, sharing and integrating data, information and knowledge, using semantic web technologies. The main goal of this paper is to identify the current status and future trends of knowledge representation and management in Life and Health Sciences, mostly with regard to linked data technologies. We selected three prominent linked data studies, namely Bio2RDF, Open PHACTS and EBI RDF platform, and selected 14 studies published after 2014 (inclusive) that cited any of the three studies. We manually analyzed these 14 papers in relation to how they use linked data techniques. The analyses show a tendency to use linked data techniques in Life and Health Sciences, and even if some studies do not follow all of the recommendations, many of them already represent and manage their knowledge using RDF and biomedical ontologies. These insights from RDF and biomedical ontologies are having a strong impact on how knowledge is generated from biomedical data, by making data elements increasingly connected and by providing a better description of their semantics. As health institutes become more data centric, we believe that the adoption of linked data techniques will continue to grow and be an effective solution to knowledge representation and management. ","204":"To summarize recent research and select the best papers published in 2015 in the field of computerized clinical decision support for the Decision Support section of the IMIA yearbook. A literature review was performed by searching two bibliographic databases for papers related to clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) and computerized provider order entry (CPOE) systems. The aim was to identify a list of candidate best papers from the retrieved papers that were then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. A consensus meeting between the two section editors and the IMIA editorial team was finally conducted to conclude in the best paper selection. Among the 974 retrieved papers, the entire review process resulted in the selection of four best papers. One paper reports on a CDSS routinely applied in pediatrics for more than 10 years, relying on adaptations of the Arden Syntax. Another paper assessed the acceptability and feasibility of an important CPOE evaluation tool in hospitals outside the US where it was developed. The third paper is a systematic, qualitative review, concerning usability flaws of medication-related alerting functions, providing an important evidence-based, methodological contribution in the domain of CDSS design and development in general. Lastly, the fourth paper describes a study quantifying the effect of a complex, continuous-care, guideline-based CDSS on the correctness and completeness of clinicians' decisions. While there are notable examples of routinely used decision support systems, this 2015 review on CDSSs and CPOE systems still shows that, despite methodological contributions, theoretical frameworks, and prototype developments, these technologies are not yet widely spread (at least with their full functionalities) in routine clinical practice. Further research, testing, evaluation, and training are still needed for these tools to be adopted in clinical practice and, ultimately, illustrate the benefits that they promise. ","205":"The introduction of health information technology into clinical settings is associated with unintended negative consequences, some with the potential to lead to error and patient harm. As adoption rates soar, the impact of these hazards will increase. Over the last decade, unintended consequences have received great attention in the medical informatics literature, and this paper seeks to identify the major themes that have emerged. Rich typologies of the causes of unintended consequences have been developed, along with a number of explanatory frameworks based on socio-technical systems theory. We however still have only limited data on the frequency and impact of these events, as most studies rely on data sets from incident reporting or patient chart reviews, rather than undertaking detailed observational studies. Such data are increasingly needed as more organizations implement health information technologies. When outcome studies have been done in different organizations, they reveal different outcomes for identical systems. From a theoretical perspective, recent advances in the emerging discipline of implementation science have much to offer in explaining the origin, and variability, of unintended consequences. The dynamic nature of health care service organizations, and the rapid development and adoption of health information technologies means that unintended consequences are unlikely to disappear, and we therefore must commit to developing robust systems to detect and manage them.

The set of MesH keywords used was provided by experts. The constant advances in medical technology allow ever more relevant diagnostic and therapeutic approaches to be designed. Nevertheless, there is a need to acquire expert knowledge of these innovations in order to identify precociously new associated problems for which new solutions need to be designed and developed.

A wide literature review on numerical and analytical simulation on simple or complex medical devices in MRI electromagnetic fields shows the evolutions through time and a growing concern for MRI safety over the years. Major issues and achievements are described, as well as current trends and perspectives in this research field. Numerical simulation of medical devices is constantly evolving, supported by calculation methods now well-established. Implants with simple geometry can often be simulated in a computational human model, but one issue remaining today is the experimental validation of these human models. A great concern is to assess RF heating on implants too complex to be traditionally simulated, like pacemaker leads. Thus, ongoing researches focus on alternative hybrids methods, both numerical and experimental, with for example a transfer function method. For the static field and gradient fields, analytical models can be used for dimensioning simple implants shapes, but limited for complex geometries that cannot be studied with simplifying assumptions. Numerical simulation is an essential tool for MRI safety testing of medical devices. The main issues remain the accuracy of simulations compared to real life and the studies of complex devices; but as the research field is constantly evolving, some promising ideas are now under investigation to take up the challenges.

The query which had been used last year to retrieve articles for the CIS section of the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2015 was refined. It again aimed at identifying relevant publications in the field of CIS and comprised search terms from the Medical Subject Headings (MeSH) catalog as well as additional free text search terms from PubMed and Web of Science. The retrieved articles were categorized in a multi-pass review carried out separately by the two section editors. The final selection of 15 candidate papers was then peer-reviewed by Yearbook editors and external reviewers. Based on the review results the four best papers were then selected at the best papers selection meeting with the IMIA Yearbook editorial board. To get an overview on the content of the retrieved articles we applied text mining and term co-occurrence mapping techniques. The query was carried out in mid-January 2016, yielding a combined result set of 1851 articles which were published in 790 different journals. The most relevant terms from abstracts and titles of these articles were assigned to six different clusters. A majority of articles dealt with two thematic blocks, problems and solutions in the CIS field. The majority of the 2016 CIS candidate papers and all four best papers could be assigned to these two thematic blocks.

Whilst the fundamental drivers to ensure that data access is ethical and satisfies privacy requirements are similar, they are often dealt with in varying ways by different approval processes. To achieve a consensus across an international panel of health care and informatics professionals on an integrated set of privacy and ethics principles that could accelerate health data access in data-driven health research projects. A three-round consensus development process was used. In round one, we developed a baseline framework for privacy, ethics, and data access based on a review of existing literature in the health, informatics, and policy domains. This was further developed using a two-round Delphi consensus building process involving 20 experts who were members of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) and European Federation of Medical Informatics (EFMI) Primary Health Care Informatics Working Groups. To achieve consensus we required an extended Delphi process. The first round involved feedback on and development of the baseline framework. This consisted of four components: (1) ethical principles, (2) ethical guidance questions, (3) privacy and data access principles, and (4) privacy and data access guidance questions. Round two developed consensus in key areas of the revised framework, allowing the building of a newly, more detailed and descriptive framework. In the final round panel experts expressed their opinions, either as agreements or disagreements, on the ethics and privacy statements of the framework finding some of the previous round disagreements to be surprising in view of established ethical principles. This study develops a framework for an integrated approach to ethics and privacy. Privacy breech risk should not be considered in isolation but instead balanced by potential ethical benefit.

The cases of IT failure through ransomware at the beginning of 2016 are impressive examples of the dependence of clinical processes on IT. Although IT risk management attempts to reduce the risk of IT blackouts, the probability of partial\/total data loss, or even worse, data falsification, is not zero. The objective of this paper is to present the state of the art with respect to strategies, processes, and governance to deal with the failure of IT systems. This article is conducted as a narrative review. Worst case scenarios are needed, dealing with methods as to how to survive the downtime of clinical systems, for example through alternative workflows. These workflows have to be trained regularly. We categorize the most important types of IT system failure, assess the usefulness of classic counter measures, and state that most risk management approaches fall short on exactly this matter. To ensure that continuous, evidence-based improvements to the recommendations for IT emergency concepts are made, it is essential that IT blackouts and IT disasters are reported, analyzed, and critically discussed. This requires changing from a culture of shame and blame to one of error and safety in healthcare IT. This change is finding its way into other disciplines in medicine. In addition, systematically planned and analyzed simulations of IT disaster may assist in IT emergency concept development.

However, greater knowledge and wider dissemination of human factors methods is needed to ensure more usable and safer health information technology (IT) systems. This paper reports on work done by the IMIA Human Factors Working Group and discusses some successful approaches that have been applied in using human factors to mitigate negative unintended consequences of health IT. The paper addresses challenges in bringing human factors approaches into mainstream health IT development. A framework for bringing human factors into the improvement of health IT is described that involves a multi-layered systematic approach to detecting technology-induced errors at all stages of a IT system development life cycle (SDLC). Such an approach has been shown to be needed and can lead to reduced risks associated with the release of health IT systems into live use with mitigation of risks of negative unintended consequences. Negative unintended consequences of the introduction of IT into healthcare (i.e. potential for technology-induced errors) continue to be reported. It is concluded that methods and approaches from the human factors and usability engineering literatures need to be more widely applied, both in the vendor community and in local and regional hospital and healthcare settings. This will require greater efforts at dissemination and knowledge translation, as well as greater interaction between the academic and vendor communities.

We searched PubMed (2014-2015) for studies evaluating the impact of patient-centered eHealth applications on patient care (behavior change, self-efficacy, and patient health-related outcomes). The Systems Engineering Initiative for Patient Safety (SEIPS 2.0) model was used as a guidance framework to identify the reported human factors possibly impacting the effectiveness of an eHealth intervention. Of the 348 potentially relevant papers, 10 papers were included for data analysis. None of the 10 papers reported a negative impact of the eHealth intervention. Seven papers involved a randomized controlled trial (RCT) study. Six of these RCTs reported a positive impact of the eHealth intervention on patient care. All 10 papers reported on human factor issues possibly mediating effects of patient-centered eHealth. Human factors involved patient characteristics, perceived social support, and (type of) interaction between patient and provider. While the amount of patient-centered eHealth interventions increases, many questions remain as to whether and to what extent human factors mediate their use and impact. Future research should adopt a formal theory-driven approach towards human factors when investigating those factors' influence on the effectiveness of these interventions. Insights could then be used to better tailor the content and design of eHealth solutions according to patient user profiles, so as to enhance eHealth interventions impact on patient behavior, self-efficacy, and health-related outcomes.

It systematically searched peer-reviewed journals in databases PubMed, Proquest, Cochrane Library, Elsevier, Sage and the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers (IEEE Digital Library) using a set of pre-defined keywords. It then employed an iterative process to filter out less relevant publications. From an initial search return of 1,519,682 results returned, twenty nine of the most relevant peer reviewed articles were identified as most relevant. Based on the results we conclude that innovative eHealth and its subset mHealth initiatives are rapidly emerging as an important means of managing cancer and other chronic diseases. The adoption is following different paths in the developed and developing worlds. Besides governance and regulatory issues, barriers still exist around information management, interoperability and integration. These include medical records available online information for clinicians and consumers on cancer and other chronic diseases, mobile app bundles that can help manage co-morbidities and the capacity of supporting communication technologies.

Literature searches in several areas of scholarship, including IT, human factors, evaluation studies, medical errors, medical informatics, and implementation science. Also, because the specific terms \"unintended consequences\" were not often included in abstracts and titles, a more nuanced search algorithm was developed. We identified 754 papers that had some empirical research on unintended consequences of HIT. An initial screen of titles and abstracts reduced this to 171 papers of potential interest. We then further filtered out papers that did not meet the following criteria: 1) the paper had to report an original empirical investigation, and 2) the impact reported had to be not negligible, i.e., in quantitative studies, the results related to unintended consequences were statistically significant; and in qualitative studies the relevant themes emerged were prominent. This resulted in 33 papers of which 15 were selected as best paper candidates. Each of these 15 papers was then separately evaluated by four reviewers. The final selection of four papers was made jointly by the external reviewers and the two section editors. There is a growing awareness of the importance of HIT's unintended consequences-be they generated by the HIT vendors, the implementation process, the consultants, the users, or most probably, some combination of the above. There has also been greater creativity in use of data sources, including secondary data (e.g., medical malpractice cases and surveys) and a wider acceptance of mixed methods to identify unintended consequences. Unfortunately, the complexity of causes mitigates the value of recommendations to avoid unwanted outcomes. Suggestions are often contentious rather than obvious, setting-specific, and not universally applicable. \"Lessons learned\" often take on generalized-and perhaps platitudinous-forms, such as: \"plan extra time,\" \"involve all of the stakeholders,\" \"recognize the different needs of different units or disciplines.\" The greater awareness of these problems, and the increased desire to identify and eliminate them is clearly reflected in the area's growing literature. We are hopeful the topic will receive additional attention and the discipline will improve its ability to identify and address these unexpected and usually adverse outcomes. ","217":"As wearable sensors take the consumer market by storm, and medical device manufacturers move to make their devices wireless and appropriate for ambulatory use, this revolution brings with it some unintended consequences, which we aim to discuss in this paper. We discuss some important unintended consequences, both beneficial and unwanted, which relate to: modifications of behavior; creation and use of big data sets; new security vulnerabilities; and unforeseen challenges faced by regulatory authorities, struggling to keep pace with recent innovations. Where possible, we proposed potential solutions to unwanted consequences. Intelligent and inclusive design processes may mitigate unintended modifications in behavior. For big data, legislating access to and use of these data will be a legal and political challenge in the years ahead, as we trade the health benefits of wearable sensors against the risk to our privacy. The wireless and personal nature of wearable sensors also exposes them to a number of unique security vulnerabilities. Regulation plays an important role in managing these security risks, but also has the dual responsibility of ensuring that wearable devices are fit for purpose. However, the burden of validating the function and security of medical devices is becoming infeasible for regulators, given the many software apps and wearable sensors entering the market each year, which are only a subset of an even larger 'internet of things'. Wearable sensors may serve to improve wellbeing, but we must be vigilant against the occurrence of unintended consequences. With collaboration between device manufacturers, regulators, and end-users, we balance the risk of unintended consequences occurring against the incredible benefit that wearable sensors promise to bring to the world. ","218":"Patient safety concerns every healthcare organization. Adoption of Health information technology (HIT) appears to have the potential to address this issue, however unanticipated and undesirable consequences from implementing HIT could lead to new and more complex hazards. This could be particularly problematic in developing countries, where regulations, policies and implementations are few, less standandarized and in some cases almost non-existing. Based on the available information and our own experience, we conducted a review of unintended consequences of HIT implementations, as they affect patient safety in developing countries. We found that user dependency on the system, alert fatigue, less communications among healthcare actors and workarounds topics should be prioritize. Institution should consider existing knowledge, learn from other experiences and model their implementations to avoid known consequences. We also recommend that they monitor and communicate their own efforts to expand knowledge in the region. ","219":"With growing use of IT by healthcare professionals and patients, the opportunity for any unintended effects of technology to disrupt care health processes and outcomes is intensified. The objectives of this position paper by the IMIA Working Group (WG) on Technology Assessment and Quality Development are to highlight how our ongoing initiatives to enhance evaluation are also addressing the unintended consequences of health IT. Review of WG initiatives Results: We argue that an evidence-based approach underpinned by rigorous evaluation is fundamental to the safe and effective use of IT, and for detecting and addressing its unintended consequences in a timely manner. We provide an overview of our ongoing initiatives to strengthen study design, execution and reporting by using evaluation frameworks and guidelines which can enable better characterization and monitoring of unintended consequences, including the Good Evaluation Practice Guideline in Health Informatics (GEP-HI) and the Statement on Reporting of Evaluation Studies in Health Informatics (STARE-HI). Indicators to benchmark the adoption and impact of IT can similarly be used to monitor unintended effects on healthcare structures, processes and outcome. We have also developed EvalDB, a web-based database of evaluation studies to promulgate evidence about unintended effects and are developing the content for courses to improve training in health IT evaluation. Evaluation is an essential ingredient for the effective use of IT to improve healthcare quality and patient safety. WG resources and skills development initiatives can facilitate a proactive and evidence-based approach to detecting and addressing the unintended effects of health IT. ","220":"No framework exists to identify and study unintended consequences (UICs) with a focus on organizational and social issues (OSIs). To address this shortcoming, we conducted a literature review to develop a framework for considering UICs and health information technology (HIT) from the perspective of OSIs. A literature review was conducted for the period 2000- 2015 using the search terms \"unintended consequences\" and \"health information technology\". 67 papers were screened, of which 18 met inclusion criteria. Data extraction was focused on the types of technologies studied, types of UICs identified, and methods of data collection and analysis used. A thematic analysis was used to identify themes related to UICs. We identified two overarching themes. One was the definition and terminology of how people classify and discuss UICs. Second was OSIs and UICs. For the OSI theme, we also identified four sub-themes: process change and evolution, individual-collaborative interchange, context of use, and approaches to model, study, and understand UICs. While there is a wide body of research on UICs, there is a lack of overall consensus on how they should be classified and reported, limiting our ability to understand the implications of UICs and how to manage them. More mixed-methods research and better proactive identification of UICs remain priorities. Our findings and framework of OSI considerations for studying UICs and HIT extend existing work on HIT and UICs by focusing on organizational and social issues. ","221":"Social media is increasingly being used in conjunction with health information technology (health IT). The objective of this paper is to identify some of the undesirable outcomes that arise from this integration and to suggest solutions to these problems. After a discussion with experts to elicit the topics that should be included in the survey, we performed a narrative review based on recent literature and interviewed multidisciplinary experts from different areas. In each case, we identified and analyzed the unintended effects of social media in health IT. Each analyzed topic provided a different set of unintended consequences. Most relevant consequences include lack of privacy with ethical and legal issues, patient confusion in disease management, poor information accuracy in crowdsourcing, unclear responsibilities, misleading and biased information in the prevention and detection of epidemics, and demotivation in gamified health solutions with social components. Using social media in healthcare offers several benefits, but it is not exempt of potential problems, and not all of these problems have clear solutions. We recommend careful design of digital systems in order to minimize patient's feelings of demotivation and frustration and we recommend following specific guidelines that should be created by all stakeholders in the healthcare ecosystem. ","222":"Assess unforeseen consequences of Telehealth and suggest solutions Methods: An outline was created collecting all possible ill effects classified into Clinical considerations, Administrative concerns including interpersonal relations, Technical issues, Legal \/ Ethical concerns and Miscellaneous. Each topic was assigned to a particular WG member to lead, gather opinion and review existing literature. A wide array of problems have been described. Except for technical issues, literature on this topic is scant, so this article is based more on personal experience and data collected from surveys. Much can be done to prevent such problems, such as a need for standardization with related clinical studies for devices as well as processes used for telehealth is underlined, besides evaluation of outcomes of projects undertaken. ","223":"The objectives of this paper are to review and discuss the methods that are being used internationally to report on, mitigate, and eliminate technology-induced errors. The IMIA Working Group for Health Informatics for Patient Safety worked together to review and synthesize some of the main methods and approaches associated with technology- induced error reporting, reduction, and mitigation. The work involved a review of the evidence-based literature as well as guideline publications specific to health informatics. The paper presents a rich overview of current approaches, issues, and methods associated with: (1) safe HIT design, (2) safe HIT implementation, (3) reporting on technology-induced errors, (4) technology-induced error analysis, and (5) health information technology (HIT) risk management. The work is based on research from around the world. Internationally, researchers have been developing methods that can be used to identify, report on, mitigate, and eliminate technology-induced errors. Although there remain issues and challenges associated with the methodologies, they have been shown to improve the quality and safety of HIT. Since the first publications documenting technology-induced errors in healthcare in 2005, we have seen in a short 10 years researchers develop ways of identifying and addressing these types of errors. We have also seen organizations begin to use these approaches. Knowledge has been translated into practice in a short ten years whereas the norm for other research areas is of 20 years. ","224":"To summarize recent research on unintended consequences associated with implementation and use of health information technology (health IT). Included in the review are original empirical investigations published in English between 2014 and 2015 that reported unintended effects introduced by adoption of digital interventions. Our analysis focuses on the trends of this steam of research, areas in which unintended consequences have continued to be reported, and common themes that emerge from the findings of these studies. Most of the papers reviewed were retrieved by searching three literature databases: MEDLINE, Embase, and CINAHL. Two rounds of searches were performed: the first round used more restrictive search terms specific to unintended consequences; the second round lifted the restrictions to include more generic health IT evaluation studies. Each paper was independently screened by at least two authors; differences were resolved through consensus development. The literature search identified 1,538 papers that were potentially relevant; 34 were deemed meeting our inclusion criteria after screening. Studies described in these 34 papers took place in a wide variety of care areas from emergency departments to ophthalmology clinics. Some papers reflected several previously unreported unintended consequences, such as staff attrition and patients' withholding of information due to privacy and security concerns. A majority of these studies (71%) were quantitative investigations based on analysis of objectively recorded data. Several of them employed longitudinal or time series designs to distinguish between unintended consequences that had only transient impact, versus those that had persisting impact. Most of these unintended consequences resulted in adverse outcomes, even though instances of beneficial impact were also noted. While care areas covered were heterogeneous, over half of the studies were conducted at academic medical centers or teaching hospitals. Recent studies published in the past two years represent significant advancement of unintended consequences research by seeking to include more types of health IT applications and to quantify the impact using objectively recorded data and longitudinal or time series designs. However, more mixed-methods studies are needed to develop deeper insights into the observed unintended adverse outcomes, including their root causes and remedies. We also encourage future research to go beyond the paradigm of simply describing unintended consequences, and to develop and test solutions that can prevent or minimize their impact. ","225":"Although the health information technology industry has made considerable progress in the design, development, implementation, and use of electronic health records (EHRs), the lofty expectations of the early pioneers have not been met. In 2006, the Provider Order Entry Team at Oregon Health &amp; Science University described a set of unintended adverse consequences (UACs), or unpredictable, emergent problems associated with computer-based provider order entry implementation, use, and maintenance. Many of these originally identified UACs have not been completely addressed or alleviated, some have evolved over time, and some new ones have emerged as EHRs became more widely available. The rapid increase in the adoption of EHRs, coupled with the changes in the types and attitudes of clinical users, has led to several new UACs, specifically: complete clinical information unavailable at the point of care; lack of innovations to improve system usability leading to frustrating user experiences; inadvertent disclosure of large amounts of patient-specific information; increased focus on computer-based quality measurement negatively affecting clinical workflows and patient-provider interactions; information overload from marginally useful computer-generated data; and a decline in the development and use of internally-developed EHRs. While each of these new UACs poses significant challenges to EHR developers and users alike, they also offer many opportunities. The challenge for clinical informatics researchers is to continue to refine our current systems while exploring new methods of overcoming these challenges and developing innovations to improve EHR interoperability, usability, security, functionality, clinical quality measurement, and information summarization and display.","226":"To provide an introduction to the 2016 IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics by the editors. We present a brief overview of the 2016 special topic \"Unintended consequences of Health IT: new problems, new solutions\", we review our choice of special topic section editors, and discuss the transitions in the editorial team for next year. This edition of the Yearbook acknowledges the fact that implementation and use of Health Information Technology (HIT) may result in unintended consequences, which may lead to both adverse and sometimes beneficial outcomes. However to date, in the literature, undesired outcomes are emphasized with a focus on the complex causes and the many sources that may generate them. The growing awareness of the importance of HIT's unintended consequences and their increasing documentation reflect a wider acceptance of HIT by users (more use generating more consequences) and and a new type of users (a shift from early adopters to late adopters and laggards), whith great expectations regarding the improvement of care quality through HIT solutions. Different points of view on new problems and new solutions of unintended consequences of Health IT are presented through the keynote paper, survey papers, and the working group contributions. The regular 2016 issue of the IMIA yearbook focuses on new unintended consequences of Health IT - brought on by wider adoption and different types of users as well as solutions to addressing them. ","227":"","228":"","229":"This paper presents the development of medical informatics education during the years from the establishment of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) until today. A search in the literature was performed using search engines and appropriate keywords as well as a manual selection of papers. The search covered English language papers and was limited to search on papers title and abstract only. The aggregated papers were analyzed on the basis of the subject area, origin, time span, and curriculum development, and conclusions were drawn. From the results, it is evident that IMIA has played a major role in comparing and integrating the Biomedical and Health Informatics educational efforts across the different levels of education and the regional distribution of educators and institutions. A large selection of references is presented facilitating future work on the field of education in biomedical and health informatics. ","230":"The fields of health terminology, classification, ontology, and related information models have evolved dramatically over the past 25 years. Our objective was to review notable trends, described emerging or enabling technologies, and highlight major terminology systems during the interval. We review the progression in health terminology systems informed by our own experiences as part of the community involved in this work, reinforced with literature review and citation. The transformation in size, scope, complexity, and adoption of health terminological systems and information models has been tremendous, on the scale of orders of magnitude. The present \"big science\" era of inference and discovery in biomedicine would not have been possible or scalable absent the growth and maturation of health terminology systems and information models over the past 25 years. ","231":"We sought to explore, via a systematic review of the literature, the state of the art of knowledge discovery in biomedical databases as it existed in 1992, and then now, 25 years later, mainly focused on supervised learning. We performed a rigorous systematic search of PubMed and latent Dirichlet allocation to identify themes in the literature and trends in the science of knowledge discovery in and between time periods and compare these trends. We restricted the result set using a bracket of five years previous, such that the 1992 result set was restricted to articles published between 1987 and 1992, and the 2015 set between 2011 and 2015. This was to reflect the current literature available at the time to researchers and others at the target dates of 1992 and 2015. The search term was framed as: Knowledge Discovery OR Data Mining OR Pattern Discovery OR Pattern Recognition, Automated. A total 538 and 18,172 documents were retrieved for 1992 and 2015, respectively. The number and type of data sources increased dramatically over the observation period, primarily due to the advent of electronic clinical systems. The period 1992- 2015 saw the emergence of new areas of research in knowledge discovery, and the refinement and application of machine learning approaches that were nascent or unknown in 1992. Over the 25 years of the observation period, we identified numerous developments that impacted the science of knowledge discovery, including the availability of new forms of data, new machine learning algorithms, and new application domains. Through a bibliometric analysis we examine the striking changes in the availability of highly heterogeneous data resources, the evolution of new algorithmic approaches to knowledge discovery, and we consider from legal, social, and political perspectives possible explanations of the growth of the field. Finally, we reflect on the achievements of the past 25 years to consider what the next 25 years will bring with regard to the availability of even more complex data and to the methods that could be, and are being now developed for the discovery of new knowledge in biomedical data. ","232":"The objective of this review is to summarize the state of the art of clinical decision support (CDS) circa 1990, review progress in the 25 year interval from that time, and provide a vision of what CDS might look like 25 years hence, or circa 2040. Informal review of the medical literature with iterative review and discussion among the authors to arrive at six axes (data, knowledge, inference, architecture and technology, implementation and integration, and users) to frame the review and discussion of selected barriers and facilitators to the effective use of CDS. In each of the six axes, significant progress has been made. Key advances in structuring and encoding standardized data with an increased availability of data, development of knowledge bases for CDS, and improvement of capabilities to share knowledge artifacts, explosion of methods analyzing and inferring from clinical data, evolution of information technologies and architectures to facilitate the broad application of CDS, improvement of methods to implement CDS and integrate CDS into the clinical workflow, and increasing sophistication of the end-user, all have played a role in improving the effective use of CDS in healthcare delivery. CDS has evolved dramatically over the past 25 years and will likely evolve just as dramatically or more so over the next 25 years. Increasingly, the clinical encounter between a clinician and a patient will be supported by a wide variety of cognitive aides to support diagnosis, treatment, care-coordination, surveillance and prevention, and health maintenance or wellness. ","233":"The last 25 years have been a period of innovation in the area of medical informatics. The International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) has published, every year for the last quarter century, the Yearbook of Medical Informatics, collating selected papers from various journals in an attempt to provide a summary of the academic medical informatics literature. The objective of this paper is to visualize the evolution of the medical informatics field over the last 25 years according to the frequency of word occurrences in the papers published in the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics. A literature review was conducted examining the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics between 1992 and 2015. These references were collated into a reference manager application to examine the literature using keyword searches, word clouds, and topic clustering. The data was considered in its entirety, as well as segregated into 3 time periods to examine the evolution of main trends over time. Several methods were used, including word clouds, cluster maps, and custom developed web-based information dashboards. The literature search resulted in a total of 1210 references published in the Yearbook, of which 213 references were excluded, resulting in 997 references for visualization. Overall, we found that publications were more technical and methods-oriented between 1992 and 1999; more clinically and patient-oriented between 2000 and 2009; and noted the emergence of \"big data\", decision support, and global health in the past decade between 2010 and 2015. Dashboards were additionally created to show individual reference data, as well as, aggregated information. Medical informatics is a vast and expanding area with new methods and technologies being researched, implemented, and evaluated. Determining visualization approaches that enhance our understanding of literature is an active area of research, and like medical informatics, is constantly evolving as new software and algorithms are developed. This paper examined several approaches for visualizing the medical informatics literature to show historical trends, associations, and aggregated summarized information to illustrate the state and changes in the IMIA Yearbook publications over the last quarter century. ","234":"The science and applications of informatics in medical imaging have advanced dramatically in the past 25 years. This article provides a selective overview of key developments in medical imaging informatics. Advances in standards and technologies for compression and transmission of digital images have enabled Picture Archiving and Communications Systems (PACS) and teleradiology. Research in speech recognition, structured reporting, ontologies, and natural language processing has improved the ability to generate and analyze the reports of imaging procedures. Informatics has provided tools to address workflow and ergonomic issues engendered by the growing volume of medical image information. Research in computeraided detection and diagnosis of abnormalities in medical images has opened new avenues to improve patient care. The growing number of medical-imaging examinations and their large volumes of information create a natural platform for \"big data\" analytics, particularly when joined with high-dimensional genomic data. Radiogenomics investigates relationships between a disease's genetic and gene-expression characteristics and its imaging phenotype; this emerging field promises to help us better understand disease biology, prognosis, and treatment options. The next 25 years offer remarkable opportunities for informatics and medical imaging together to lead to further advances in both disciplines and to improve health. ","235":"To review the history of clinical information systems over the past twenty-five years and project anticipated changes to those systems over the next twenty-five years. Over 250 Medline references about clinical information systems, quality of patient care, and patient safety were reviewed. Books, Web resources, and the author's personal experience with developing the HELP system were also used. There have been dramatic improvements in the use and acceptance of clinical computing systems and Electronic Health Records (EHRs), especially in the United States. Although there are still challenges with the implementation of such systems, the rate of progress has been remarkable. Over the next twenty-five years, there will remain many important opportunities and challenges. These opportunities include understanding complex clinical computing issues that must be studied, understood and optimized. Dramatic improvements in quality of care and patient safety must be anticipated as a result of the use of clinical information systems. These improvements will result from a closer involvement of clinical informaticians in the optimization of patient care processes. Clinical information systems and computerized clinical decision support have made contributions to medicine in the past. Therefore, by using better medical knowledge, optimized clinical information systems, and computerized clinical decision, we will enable dramatic improvements in both the quality and safety of patient care in the next twenty-five years. ","236":"During the last decades, health-enabling and ambient assistive technologies became of considerable relevance for new informatics-based forms of diagnosis, prevention, and therapy. To describe the state of the art of health-enabling and ambient assistive technologies in 1992 and today, and its evolution over the last 25 years as well as to project where the field is expected to be in the next 25 years. In the context of this review, we define health-enabling and ambient assistive technologies as ambiently used sensor-based information and communication technologies, aiming at contributing to a person's health and health care as well as to her or his quality of life. Systematic review of all original articles with research focus in all volumes of the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics. Surveying authors independently on key projects and visions as well as on their lessons learned in the context of health-enabling and ambient assistive technologies and summarizing their answers. Surveying authors independently on their expectations for the future and summarizing their answers. IMIA Yearbook papers containing statements on health-enabling and ambient assistive technologies appear first in 2002. These papers form a minor part of published research articles in medical informatics. However, during recent years the number of articles published has increased significantly. Key projects were identified. There was a clear progress on the use of technologies. However proof of diagnostic relevance and therapeutic efficacy remains still limited. Reforming health care processes and focussing more on patient needs are required. Health-enabling and ambient assistive technologies remain an important field for future health care and for interdisciplinary research. More and more publications assume that a person's home and their interaction therein, are becoming important components in health care provision, assessment, and management. ","237":"Describe the state of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) in 1992 and their evolution by 2015 and where EHRs are expected to be in 25 years. Further to discuss the expectations for EHRs in 1992 and explore which of them were realized and what events accelerated or disrupted\/derailed how EHRs evolved. Literature search based on \"Electronic Health Record\", \"Medical Record\", and \"Medical Chart\" using Medline, Google, Wikipedia Medical, and Cochrane Libraries resulted in an initial review of 2,356 abstracts and other information in papers and books. Additional papers and books were identified through the review of references cited in the initial review. By 1992, hardware had become more affordable, powerful, and compact and the use of personal computers, local area networks, and the Internet provided faster and easier access to medical information. EHRs were initially developed and used at academic medical facilities but since most have been replaced by large vendor EHRs. While EHR use has increased and clinicians are being prepared to practice in an EHR-mediated world, technical issues have been overshadowed by procedural, professional, social, political, and especially ethical issues as well as the need for compliance with standards and information security. There have been enormous advancements that have taken place, but many of the early expectations for EHRs have not been realized and current EHRs still do not meet the needs of today's rapidly changing healthcare environment. The current use of EHRs initiated by new technology would have been hard to foresee. Current and new EHR technology will help to provide international standards for interoperable applications that use health, social, economic, behavioral, and environmental data to communicate, interpret, and act intelligently upon complex healthcare information to foster precision medicine and a learning health system. ","238":"Consumer Health Informatics (CHI) is a rapidly growing domain within the field of biomedical and health informatics. The objective of this paper is to reflect on the past twenty five years and showcase informatics concepts and applications that led to new models of care and patient empowerment, and to predict future trends and challenges for the next 25 years. We discuss concepts and systems based on a review and analysis of published literature in the consumer health informatics domain in the last 25 years. The field was introduced with the vision that one day patients will be in charge of their own health care using informatics tools and systems. Scientific literature in the field originally focused on ways to assess the quality and validity of available printed health information, only to grow significantly to cover diverse areas such as online communities, social media, and shared decision-making. Concepts such as home telehealth, mHealth, and the quantified-self movement, tools to address transparency of health care organizations, and personal health records and portals provided significant milestones in the field. Consumers are able to actively participate in the decision-making process and to engage in health care processes and decisions. However, challenges such as health literacy and the digital divide have hindered us from maximizing the potential of CHI tools with a significant portion of underserved populations unable to access and utilize them. At the same time, at a global scale consumer tools can increase access to care for underserved populations in developing countries. The field continues to grow and emerging movements such as precision medicine and the sharing economy will introduce new opportunities and challenges. ","239":"The promise of the field of Medical Informatics has been great and its impact has been significant. In 1999, the Yearbook editors of the International Medical Informatics Association (IMIA) - also the authors of the present paper - sought to assess this impact by selecting a number of seminal papers in the field, and asking experts to comment on these articles. In particular, it was requested whether and how the expectations, represented by these papers, had been fulfilled since their publication several decades earlier. Each expert was also invited to comment on what might be expected in the future. In the present paper, these areas are briefly reviewed again. Where did these early papers have an impact and where were they not as successful as originally expected? It should be noted that the extraordinary developments in computer technology observed in the last two decades could not have been foreseen by these early researchers. In closing, some of the possibilities and limitations of research in medical informatics are outlined in the context of a framework that considers six levels of computer applications in medicine and health care. For each level, some predictions are made for the future, concluded with thoughts on fruitful areas for ongoing research in the field. ","240":"Medical workstations are getting more and more powerful - however for the last decades they have been slow in making their way into the everyday life in medical care. In some resource rich organisations or smaller countries, their advance has gone further than elsewhere - however, a tipping point has not been reached. Again and again, new technologies and developments are pushing the need for integration of workstations into medical processes - currently the quantified self wave - however more options lead to more complexity and this growing complexity makes it more difficult to integrate the power of medical workstations in given culturally primed scenarios. ","241":"To review and update the Preface to the 1998 Yearbook of Medical Informatics, which had as its Special Topic \"Health Informatics and the Internet\". Assessment of the accuracy of predictions made in 1998 and consideration of key developments in informatics since that time. Predictions made in 1998 were generally accurate regarding reduced dependence on keyboards, expansion of multimedia, medical data privacy policy development, impact of molecular biology on knowledge and treatment of neoplasms, and use of imaging and informatics to advance understanding of brain structure and function. Key developments since 1998 include the huge increase in publicly available electronic information; acknowledgement by leaders in government and science of the importance of biomedical informatics to societal goals for health, health care, and scientific discovery; the influence of the public in promoting clinical research transparency and free access to government-funded research results; the long-awaited arrival of electronic health records; and the \"Cloud\" as a 21st century reformulation of contracting out the computer center. There are many challenging and important problems that deserve the attention of the informatics community. Informatics researchers will be best served by embracing a very broad definition of medical informatics and by promoting public understanding of the field. ","242":"The authors highlight IMIA's progress over the past twenty years as a key bridging organization that translates health informatics theory into practice. In contrast, they describe that electronic health record (EHR) systems built in the 20th Century are not meeting the needs of clinical users. Moreover, these EHRs are not architected to keep pace with the rapid changes in the evolving health ecosystem. They conclude that 21st Century health IT systems need to be architected into an ecosystem-wide suite of interacting complex adaptive systems that support individuals, clinicians, managers and policy-makers with the high value\/high usability computing paradigm that dominates the Internet today.

In the intervening decade, \"translational biomedical informatics\" has emerged as the umbrella term for the work that brings together biological entities and clinical entities. The major challenges continue: understanding the clinical significance of basic 'omics' (and other) measurements, and communicating this to increasingly empowered patients\/consumers who often have access to this information outside usual medical channels. It has become clear that basic molecular information must be combined with environmental and lifestyle data to fully define, predict, and manage health status..

We conducted a review of English-language research works conducted in the domain of public health informatics (PHI), and published in MEDLINE between January 2012 and December 2014, where information and communication technology (ICT) was a primary subject, or a main component of the study methodology. Selected articles were synthesized using a thematic analysis using the Essential Services of Public Health as a typology. Based on themes that emerged, we organized the advances into a model where applications that support the Essential Services are, in turn, supported by a socio-technical infrastructure that relies on government policies and ethical principles. That infrastructure, in turn, depends upon education and training of the public health workforce, development that creates novel or adapts existing infrastructure, and research that evaluates the success of the infrastructure. Finally, the persistence and growth of infrastructure depends on financial sustainability. Public health informatics is a field that is growing in breadth, depth, and complexity. Several Essential Services have benefited from informatics, notably, \"Monitor Health,\" \"Diagnose &amp; Investigate,\" and \"Evaluate.\" Yet many Essential Services still have not yet benefited from advances such as maturing electronic health record systems, interoperability amongst health information systems, analytics for population health management, use of social media among consumers, and educational certification in clinical informatics. There is much work to be done to further advance the science of PHI as well as its impact on public health practice.

A systematic review of the literature was performed by the two section editors of the IMIA Yearbook NLP section by searching bibliographic databases with a focus on NLP efforts applied to clinical texts or aimed at a clinical outcome. A shortlist of candidate best papers was first selected by the section editors before being peer-reviewed by independent external reviewers. The clinical NLP best paper selection shows that the field is tackling text analysis methods of increasing depth. The full review process highlighted five papers addressing foundational methods in clinical NLP using clinically relevant texts from online forums or encyclopedias, clinical texts from Electronic Health Records, and included studies specifically aiming at a practical clinical outcome. The increased access to clinical data that was made possible with the recent progress of de-identification paved the way for the scientific community to address complex NLP problems such as word sense disambiguation, negation, temporal analysis and specific information nugget extraction. These advances in turn allowed for efficient application of NLP to clinical problems such as cancer patient triage. Another line of research investigates online clinically relevant texts and brings interesting insight on communication strategies to convey health-related information. The field of clinical NLP is thriving through the contributions of both NLP researchers and healthcare professionals interested in applying NLP techniques for concrete healthcare purposes. Clinical NLP is becoming mature for practical applications with a significant clinical impact. ","250":"We present a review of recent advances in clinical Natural Language Processing (NLP), with a focus on semantic analysis and key subtasks that support such analysis. We conducted a literature review of clinical NLP research from 2008 to 2014, emphasizing recent publications (2012-2014), based on PubMed and ACL proceedings as well as relevant referenced publications from the included papers. Significant articles published within this time-span were included and are discussed from the perspective of semantic analysis. Three key clinical NLP subtasks that enable such analysis were identified: 1) developing more efficient methods for corpus creation (annotation and de-identification), 2) generating building blocks for extracting meaning (morphological, syntactic, and semantic subtasks), and 3) leveraging NLP for clinical utility (NLP applications and infrastructure for clinical use cases). Finally, we provide a reflection upon most recent developments and potential areas of future NLP development and applications. There has been an increase of advances within key NLP subtasks that support semantic analysis. Performance of NLP semantic analysis is, in many cases, close to that of agreement between humans. The creation and release of corpora annotated with complex semantic information models has greatly supported the development of new tools and approaches. Research on non-English languages is continuously growing. NLP methods have sometimes been successfully employed in real-world clinical tasks. However, there is still a gap between the development of advanced resources and their utilization in clinical settings. A plethora of new clinical use cases are emerging due to established health care initiatives and additional patient-generated sources through the extensive use of social media and other devices. ","251":"To summarize excellent current research in the field of Bioinformatics and Translational Informatics with application in the health domain and clinical care. We provide a synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2015, from which we attempt to derive a synthetic overview of current and future activities in the field. As last year, a first step of selection was performed by querying MEDLINE with a list of MeSH descriptors completed by a list of terms adapted to the section. Each section editor has evaluated separately the set of 1,594 articles and the evaluation results were merged for retaining 15 articles for peer-review. The selection and evaluation process of this Yearbook's section on Bioinformatics and Translational Informatics yielded four excellent articles regarding data management and genome medicine that are mainly tool-based papers. In the first article, the authors present PPISURV a tool for uncovering the role of specific genes in cancer survival outcome. The second article describes the classifier PredictSNP which combines six performing tools for predicting disease-related mutations. In the third article, by presenting a high-coverage map of the human proteome using high resolution mass spectrometry, the authors highlight the need for using mass spectrometry to complement genome annotation. The fourth article is also related to patient survival and decision support. The authors present datamining methods of large-scale datasets of past transplants. The objective is to identify chances of survival. The current research activities still attest the continuous convergence of Bioinformatics and Medical Informatics, with a focus this year on dedicated tools and methods to advance clinical care. Indeed, there is a need for powerful tools for managing and interpreting complex, large-scale genomic and biological datasets, but also a need for user-friendly tools developed for the clinicians in their daily practice.

","254":"In order to realize the promise of personalized medicine, Translational Bioinformatics (TBI) research will need to continue to address implementation issues across the clinical spectrum. In this review, we aim to evaluate the expanding field of TBI towards clinical applications, and define common themes and current gaps in order to motivate future research. Here we present the state-of-the-art of clinical implementation of TBI-based tools and resources. Our thematic analyses of a targeted literature search of recent TBI-related articles ranged across topics in genomics, data management, hypothesis generation, molecular epidemiology, diagnostics, therapeutics and personalized medicine. Open areas of clinically-relevant TBI research identified in this review include developing data standards and best practices, publicly available resources, integrative systemslevel approaches, user-friendly tools for clinical support, cloud computing solutions, emerging technologies and means to address pressing legal, ethical and social issues. There is a need for further research bridging the gap from foundational TBI-based theories and methodologies to clinical implementation. We have organized the topic themes presented in this review into four conceptual foci - domain analyses, knowledge engineering, computational architectures and computation methods alongside three stages of knowledge development in order to orient future TBI efforts to accelerate the goals of personalized medicine. ","255":"To summarize the 2014 state of the art in the areas related to consumer health informatics and social media. We conducted a systematic review of articles published in 2014 in PubMed with a predefined set of queries. We identified 439 articles relevant for the review. The two section editors independently screened those papers taking into account their relevance to the topics covered by the section. In a second step, they jointly selected the 20 most representative papers as candidate best papers. Candidate best papers were then submitted for full review and scoring by external reviewers. Based on the scoring, section editors together with the IMIA Yearbook editorial board selected the four best papers published in 2014 in consumer health informatics. Helping patients acquire a healthier lifestyle is a crucial part of patient empowerment. In this line of work, new studies are exploring the efficacy of online health interventions for patient behavioral change. The special case of smoking cessation for consumers with low socio-economic status is particularly noticeable. Another study has explored how an online intervention can reduce the anxiety of women who experience an abnormal mammography. The team of PatientsLikeMe has studied how online support groups could play a role in the quality of life of organ transplant recipients. The patient perspective of online forums' users is also analyzed in the domain of anticoagulation therapy. Online health interventions, many of them using social media, have confirmed their potential to impact consumer behavioral change. However, there are still many methodological issues that need to be addressed in order to prove cost-effectiveness. ","256":"Social media, web and mobile technologies are increasingly used in healthcare and directly support patientcentered care. Patients benefit from disease self-management tools, contact to others, and closer monitoring. Researchers study drug efficiency, or recruit patients for clinical studies via these technologies. However, low communication barriers in socialmedia, limited privacy and security issues lead to problems from an ethical perspective. This paper summarizes the ethical issues to be considered when social media is exploited in healthcare contexts. Starting from our experiences in social-media research, we collected ethical issues for selected social-media use cases in the context of patient-centered care. Results were enriched by collecting and analyzing relevant literature and were discussed and interpreted by members of the IMIA Social Media Working Group. Most relevant issues in social-media applications are confidence and privacy that need to be carefully preserved. The patient-physician relationship can suffer from the new information gain on both sides since private information of both healthcare provider and consumer may be accessible through the Internet. Physicians need to ensure they keep the borders between private and professional intact. Beyond, preserving patient anonymity when citing Internet content is crucial for research studies. Exploiting medical social-media in healthcare applications requires a careful reflection of roles and responsibilities. Availability of data and information can be useful in many settings, but the abuse of data needs to be prevented. Preserving privacy and confidentiality of online users is a main issue, as well as providing means for patients or Internet users to express concerns on data usage. ","257":"To summarize the best papers in the field of Knowledge Representation and Management (KRM). A comprehensive review of medical informatics literature was performed to select some of the most interesting papers of KRM published in 2014. Four articles were selected, two focused on annotation and information retrieval using an ontology. The two others focused mainly on ontologies, one dealing with the usage of a temporal ontology in order to analyze the content of narrative document, one describing a methodology for building multilingual ontologies. Semantic models began to show their efficiency, coupled with annotation tools.

However, the evolution of a domain's knowledge directly impacts these terminologies and generates inconsistencies in the underlying biomedical information systems. In this article, we review existing work addressing the dynamic aspect of terminologies as well as their effects on mappings and semantic annotations. We investigate approaches related to the identification, characterization and propagation of changes in terminologies, mappings and semantic annotations including techniques to update their content. Based on the explored issues and existing methods, we outline open research challenges requiring investigation in the near future. ","259":"To summarize recent research and propose a selection of best papers published in 2014 in the field of computerized clinical decision support for the Decision Support section of the IMIA yearbook. A literature review was performed by searching two bibliographic databases for papers related to clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) and computerized provider order entry systems in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be then peer-reviewed by external reviewers. A consensus meeting between the two section editors and the editorial team was finally organized to conclude on the selection of best papers. Among the 1,254 returned papers published in 2014, the full review process selected four best papers. The first one is an experimental contribution to a better understanding of unintended uses of CDSSs. The second paper describes the effective use of previously collected data to tailor and adapt a CDSS. The third paper presents an innovative application that uses pharmacogenomic information to support personalized medicine. The fourth paper reports on the long-term effect of the routine use of a CDSS for antibiotic therapy. As health information technologies spread more and more meaningfully, CDSSs are improving to answer users' needs more accurately. The exploitation of previously collected data and the use of genomic data for decision support has started to materialize. However, more work is still needed to address issues related to the correct usage of such technologies, and to assess their effective impact in the long term. ","260":"This survey aims at highlighting the latest trends (2012-2014) on the development, use, and evaluation of Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) based decision support systems (DSSs) in medicine, with a particular focus on patient-centered and personalized care. We considered papers published on scientific journals, by querying PubMed and Web of ScienceTM. Included studies focused on the implementation or evaluation of ICT-based tools used in clinical practice. A separate search was performed on computerized physician order entry systems (CPOEs), since they are increasingly embedding patient-tailored decision support. We found 73 papers on DSSs (53 on specific ICT tools) and 72 papers on CPOEs. Although decision support through the delivery of recommendations is frequent (28\/53 papers), our review highlighted also DSSs only based on efficient information presentation (25\/53). Patient participation in making decisions is still limited (9\/53), and mostly focused on risk communication. The most represented medical area is cancer (12%). Policy makers are beginning to be included among stakeholders (6\/73), but integration with hospital information systems is still low. Concerning knowledge representation\/management issues, we identified a trend towards building inference engines on top of standard data models. Most of the tools (57%) underwent a formal assessment study, even if half of them aimed at evaluating usability and not effectiveness. Overall, we have noticed interesting evolutions of medical DSSs to improve communication with the patient, consider the economic and organizational impact, and use standard models for knowledge representation. However, systems focusing on patient-centered care still do not seem to be available at large.

A set of MeSH keywords provided by experts was used. This selection was peer-reviewed by external reviewers. The review process highlighted articles illustrating two current trends related to care coordination and patient centered care: the enhanced capacity to predict the evolution of a disease based on patient-specific information can impact care coordination; similarly, better perception of the patient and his treatment could lead to enhanced personalized care with a potential impact on care coordination. This review shows the multiplicity of angles from which the question of patient-centered care can be addressed, with consequences on care coordination that will need to be confirmed and demonstrated in the future. ","262":"The aim of this paper is to review existing technologies for the nociception \/ anti-nociception balance evaluation during surgery under general anesthesia. General anesthesia combines the use of analgesic, hypnotic and muscle-relaxant drugs in order to obtain a correct level of patient non-responsiveness during surgery. During the last decade, great efforts have been deployed in order to find adequate ways to measure how anesthetic drugs affect a patient's response to surgical nociception. Nowadays, though some monitoring devices allow obtaining information about hypnosis and muscle relaxation, no gold standard exists for the nociception \/ anti-nociception balance evaluation. Articles from the PubMed literature search engine were reviewed. As this paper focused on surgery under general anesthesia, articles about nociception monitoring on conscious patients, in post-anesthesia care unit or in intensive care unit were not considered. In this article, we present a review of existing technologies for the nociception \/ anti-nociception balance evaluation, which is based in all cases on the analysis of the autonomous nervous system activity. Presented systems, based on sensors and physiological signals processing algorithms, allow studying the patients' reaction regarding anesthesia and surgery. Some technological solutions for nociception \/ antinociception balance monitoring were described. Though presented devices could constitute efficient solutions for individualized anti-nociception management during general anesthesia, this review of current literature emphasizes the fact that the choice to use one or the other mainly relies on the clinical context and the general purpose of the monitoring.

With the rise of the concept of integrated care organizational borders, the sole focus on data aggregation or healthcare professionals as users disappear more and more. The manuscript discusses the concept of CISs and investigates critical success factors for CISs in the context of integrated care and in the course of time. In order to identify critical success factors and barriers for CISs a systematic literature review was conducted based on the results from PubMed and Cochrane, using MaxQDA. Search results were thereby limited to reviews or meta-analysis. We have found 1919 references of which 40 met the inclusion criteria. The analysis of the manuscripts resulted in a comprehensive list of success factors and barriers related to CISs in integrated care settings. Most barriers were user-related whereas for the success factors an even distribution of organizational, technical and user-related factors was observed. The vast majority of publications was focused on healthcare professionals. It is important to incorporate experiences made\/ collected over time, as the problems encountered seem to remain almost unvaried.

We searched MEDLINE and EMBASE (2013-2014) for studies describing the design or the evaluation of a mobile health application that aimed to support patients' active involvement in the coordination of their care. 34 papers met the inclusion criteria. Applications ranged from tools that supported self-management of specific conditions (e.g. asthma) to tools that provided coaching or education. Twelve of the 15 papers describing the design or development of an app reported the use of a human factors approach. The most frequently used methods were interviews and surveys, which often included an exploration of participants' current use of information technology. Sixteen papers described the evaluation of a patient application in practice. All of them adopted a human factors approach, typically an examination of the use of app features and\/or surveys or interviews which enquired about patients' views of the effects of using the app on their behaviors (e.g. medication adherence), knowledge, and relationships with healthcare providers. No study in our review assessed the impact of mobile applications on health outcomes. The potential of mobile health applications to assist patients to more actively engage in the management of their care has resulted in a large number of applications being developed. Our review showed that human factors approaches are nearly always adopted to some extent in the design, development, and evaluation of mobile applications.

We bring together a broad body of literature, aiming to identify those leading examples of health informatics that have advanced the methodology of machine learning. While individual methods may have further examples that might be added, we have chosen some of the most representative, informative exemplars in each case. Our survey highlights that, while much research is taking place in this high-profile field, examples of those that affect the clinical management of patients are seldom found. We show that substantial progress is being made in terms of methodology, often by data scientists working in close collaboration with clinical groups.

The second selected paper illustrates several unintended consequences of HIT designed to improve care coordination. The third selected paper shows that advanced analytic techniques in medical informatics can be instrumental in studying patient-centered care coordination. The realization of true patient-centered care coordination is dependent upon a number of factors. Standardization of clinical documentation and HIT interoperability across organization and settings is a critical prerequisite for HIT to support patient-centered care coordination.

The objective of this paper is to identify the current status and future trends of patient-centered care and the role of informatics systems and tools in facilitating this model of care. In this paper we review recent scientific literature of the past four years to identify trends and state of current evidence when it comes to patient-centered care overall, and more specifically medical homes. There are several studies that indicate growth and development in seven informatics areas within patient-centered care, namely clinical decision support, registries, team care, care transitions, personal health records, telehealth, and measurement. In some cases we are still lacking large randomized clinical trials and the evidence base is not always solid, but findings strongly indicate the potential of informatics to support patient-centered care. Current evidence indicates that advancements have been made in implementing and evaluating patient-centered care models. Technical, legal, and practical challenges still remain.

To begin to address this and other issues, health care reform was passed, including the notion of accountable care. Under acountable care arrangements, providers are at risk for the costs of the care they provide to groups of patients. Evaluation of costs has made it clear that a large proportion of these costs are in the post-acute setting, and also that many specific problems such as adverse events and unnecessary readmissions occur following transitions. However, the electronic health records of today do not provide a great deal of assistance with the coordination of care, and even the best organizations have relatively primitive systems with respect to care coordination, even though communication is absolutely central to better coordination of care and health information technology (HIT) is a powerful lever for improving communication. This paper identifies specific gaps in care coordination today, presents a framework for better coordinating care using HIT, then describes how specific technologies can be leveraged.

We provide a brief overview of the 2015 special topic \"Patient-Centered Care Coordination\", discuss the addition of two new sections to the Yearbook, Natural Language Processing and Public Health &amp; Epidemiology Informatics, and present our editorial plans for the upcoming celebration of the 25th anniversary of the Yearbook. Care delivery currently occurs through the processing of complex clinical pathways designed for increasingly multi-morbid patients by various practitioners in different settings. To avoid the consequences of the fragmentation of services, care should be organized to coordinate all providers, giving them the opportunity to share the same holistic view of the patient's condition, and to be informed of the planned clinical pathway that establishes the roles and interventions of each one. The adoption and use of electronic health records (EHRs) is a solution to address health information sharing and care coordination challenges. However, while EHRs are necessary, they are not sufficient to achieve care coordination, creating information availability does not mean the information will be accessed. This edition of the Yearbook acknowledges the fact that health information technology (HIT), and EHRs in particular, are not yet fully addressing the challenges in care coordination. Emerging trends, tools, and applications of HIT to support care coordination are presented through the keynote paper, survey papers, and working group contributions. In 2015, the IMIA Yearbook has been extended to emphasize two fields of biomedical informatics through new sections. Next year, the 25th anniversary of the Yearbook will be celebrated in grand style!

By 1975, several prototype systems had been developed and clinically tested, and the Rutgers Research Resource on Computers in Biomedicine hosted the first in a series of workshops on AI in Medicine that helped researchers and clinicians share their ideas, demonstrate their models, and comment on the prospects for the field. These developments and the workshops themselves benefited considerably from Stanford's SUMEX-AIM pioneering experiment in biomedical computer networking.

We discuss the need for changing organisational processes as well as the current mixed evidence regarding patient portals as a logical tool, and the reasons for this dichotomy, together with the evaluation principles supported by theoretical frameworks so as to yield robust evidence. There is expressed commitment to coordinated care and to putting the patient in the centre. However to achieve this, new interactive patient portals will be needed to enable peer communication by all stakeholders including patients and professionals.

User Driven Health Care offers the dynamic integration of patient values and evidence based solutions for improved medical communication in medical care. This paper conceptualizes patient care-coordination through the lens of engaged stakeholders using digital infrastructures tools to integrate information technology. We distinguish this lens from the prevalent conceptualization of dyadic ties between clinician-patient, patient-nurse, clinician-nurse, and offer the holistic integration of all stakeholder inputs, in the clinic and augmented by online communication in a multi-national setting. We analyze an instance of the user-driven health care (UDHC), a network of providers, patients, students and researchers working together to help manage patient care. The network currently focuses on patients from LMICs, but the provider network is global in reach. We describe UDHC and its opportunities and challenges in care-coordination to reduce costs, bring equity, and improve care quality and share evidence. UDHC has resulted in coordinated global based local care, affecting multiple facets of medical practice.

Discussions about PCCC emerged from a brief guide that posed questions about what is PCCC, why consider PCCC important, barriers to grow in this direction and ask about resources considered relevant in the topic. PCCC encompasses a broad definition, includes physical, mental, socio-environmental and self care. Even benefits are proved, in developing countries the lack of a comprehensive and integrated healthcare network is one of the main barriers to reach this objective. Working hard to reach strong health policies, focus on patients, and optimizing the use of resources could improve the performance in the devolvement of PCCC programs. International collaboration could bring benefits. We believe information IT, and education in this field will play an important role in PCCC. PCCC in developing countries has the potential to improve quality of care.

There has been no previous attempt to systematically explore the consequences of usability flaws in such systems on users (i.e. usage problems) and work systems (i.e. negative outcomes). This paper aims at exploring and synthesizing the consequences of usability flaws in terms of usage problems and negative outcomes on the work system. A secondary analysis of 26 papers included in a prior systematic review of the usability flaws in medication alerting was performed. Usage problems and negative outcomes were extracted and sorted. Links between usability flaws, usage problems, and negative outcomes were also analyzed. Poor usability generates a large variety of consequences. It impacts the user from a cognitive, behavioral, emotional, and attitudinal perspective. Ultimately, usability flaws have negative consequences on the workflow, the effectiveness of the technology, the medication management process, and, more importantly, patient safety. Only few complete pathways leading from usability flaws to negative outcomes were identified. Usability flaws in medication alerting systems impede users, and ultimately their work system, and negatively impact patient safety. Therefore, the usability dimension may act as a hidden explanatory variable that could explain, at least partly, the (absence of) intended outcomes of new technology.

The consensus building exercise involved 20 individuals, five general practitioners and 15 informatics academics, members of the International Medical Informatics Association Primary Care Informatics Working Group. A thematic analysis of the literature was carried out according to the defined themes. The first round of the analysis developed 27 statements on how the CMR, or any other information system, including paper-based medical records, supports care delivery. Round 2 aimed at achieving a consensus about the statements of round one. Round 3 stated that there was an agreement on informatics principles and structures that should be put in place. However, there was a disagreement about the processes involved in the implementation, and about the clinical interaction with the systems after the implementation. The panel had a strong agreement about the core concepts and structures that should be put in place to support high quality care. However, this agreement evaporated over statements related to implementation. These findings reflect literature and personal experiences: whilst there is consensus about how informatics structures and processes support good quality care, implementation is difficult.

New and emerging diseases present opportunities for repurposing existing technologies and for stimulating the development of new HIT innovation. Innovative technologies may be developed such as new software used for tracking patients during new or emerging disease outbreaks or by repurposing and extending existing technologies so they can be used to support patients, families and health professionals who may have been exposed to a disease. The paper describes the development of new technologies and the repurposing and extension of existing ones (such as electronic health records) using the most recent outbreak of Ebola as an example. ","282":"To select and summarize key contributions to current research in the field of Clinical Research Informatics (CRI). A bibliographic search using a combination of MeSH and free terms search over PubMed was performed followed by a blinded review. The review process resulted in the selection of four papers illustrating various aspects of current research efforts in the area of CRI. The first paper tackles the challenge of extracting accurate phenotypes from Electronic Healthcare Records (EHRs). Privacy protection within shared de-identified, patient-level research databases is the focus of the second selected paper. Two other papers exemplify the growing role of formal representation of clinical data - in metadata repositories - and knowledge - in ontologies - for supporting the process of reusing data for clinical research. The selected articles demonstrate how concrete platforms are currently achieving interoperability across clinical research and care domains and have reached the evaluation phase. When EHRs linked to genetic data have the potential to shift the research focus from research driven patient recruitment to phenotyping in large population, a key issue is to lower patient re-identification risks for biomedical research databases. Current research illustrates the potential of knowledge engineering to support, in the coming years, the scientific lifecycle of clinical research. ","283":"The goal of this survey is to discuss the impact of the growing availability of electronic health record (EHR) data on the evolving field of Clinical Research Informatics (CRI), which is the union of biomedical research and informatics. Major challenges for the use of EHR-derived data for research include the lack of standard methods for ensuring that data quality, completeness, and provenance are sufficient to assess the appropriateness of its use for research. Areas that need continued emphasis include methods for integrating data from heterogeneous sources, guidelines (including explicit phenotype definitions) for using these data in both pragmatic clinical trials and observational investigations, strong data governance to better understand and control quality of enterprise data, and promotion of national standards for representing and using clinical data. The use of EHR data has become a priority in CRI. Awareness of underlying clinical data collection processes will be essential in order to leverage these data for clinical research and patient care, and will require multi-disciplinary teams representing clinical research, informatics, and healthcare operations. Considerations for the use of EHR data provide a starting point for practical applications and a CRI research agenda, which will be facilitated by CRI's key role in the infrastructure of a learning healthcare system. ","284":"To summarize excellent current research in the field of Bioinformatics and Translational Informatics with application in the health domain. We provide a synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2014, from which we attempt to derive a synthetic overview of current and future activities in the field. A first step of selection was performed by querying MEDLINE with a list of MeSH descriptors completed by a list of terms adapted to the section. Each section editor evaluated independently the set of 1,851 articles and 15 articles were retained for peer-review. The selection and evaluation process of this Yearbook's section on Bioinformatics and Translational Informatics yielded three excellent articles regarding data management and genome medicine. In the first article, the authors present VEST (Variant Effect Scoring Tool) which is a supervised machine learning tool for prioritizing variants found in exome sequencing projects that are more likely involved in human Mendelian diseases. In the second article, the authors show how to infer surnames of male individuals by crossing anonymous publicly available genomic data from the Y chromosome and public genealogy data banks. The third article presents a statistical framework called iCluster+ that can perform pattern discovery in integrated cancer genomic data. This framework was able to determine different tumor subtypes in colon cancer. The current research activities still attest the continuous convergence of Bioinformatics and Medical Informatics, with a focus this year on large-scale biological, genomic, and Electronic Health Records data. Indeed, there is a need for powerful tools for managing and interpreting complex data, but also a need for user-friendly tools developed for the clinicians in their daily practice. All the recent research and development efforts are contributing to the challenge of impacting clinically the results and even going towards a personalized medicine in the near future. ","285":"Given the quickening speed of discovery of variant disease drivers from combined patient genotype and phenotype data, the objective is to provide methodology using big data technology to support the definition of deep phenotypes in medical records. As the vast stores of genomic information increase with next generation sequencing, the importance of deep phenotyping increases. The growth of genomic data and adoption of Electronic Health Records (EHR) in medicine provides a unique opportunity to integrate phenotype and genotype data into medical records. The method by which collections of clinical findings and other health related data are leveraged to form meaningful phenotypes is an active area of research. Longitudinal data stored in EHRs provide a wealth of information that can be used to construct phenotypes of patients. We focus on a practical problem around data integration for deep phenotype identification within EHR data. The use of big data approaches are described that enable scalable markup of EHR events that can be used for semantic and temporal similarity analysis to support the identification of phenotype and genotype relationships. Stead and colleagues' 2005 concept of using light standards to increase the productivity of software systems by riding on the wave of hardware\/processing power is described as a harbinger for designing future healthcare systems. The big data solution, using flexible markup, provides a route to improved utilization of processing power for organizing patient records in genotype and phenotype research.

Survey of key themes in translational bioinformatics, primarily from 2012 and 2013. This survey focuses on four major themes: the growing use of Electronic Health Records (EHRs) as a source for genomic discovery, adoption of genomics and pharmacogenomics in clinical practice, the possible use of genomic technologies for drug repurposing, and the use of personal genomics to guide care. Reuse of abundant clinical data for research is speeding discovery, and implementation of genomic data into clinical medicine is impacting care with new classes of data rarely used previously in medicine.

Yet, what makes mobile-phone-based services succeed in low and middle-income countries (LMIC) and what opportunities does the future hold that still need to be studied. We showcase demonstrator services that leverage mobile phones in the hands of patients to promote health and facilitate health care. We surveyed the recent biomedical literature for demonstrator services that illustrate well-considered examples of mobile phone interventions for consumer health. We draw upon those examples to discuss enabling factors, scalability, reach, and potential of mHealth as well as obstacles in LMIC. Among the 227 articles returned by a PubMed search, we identified 55 articles that describe services targeting health consumers equipped with mobile phones. From those articles, we showcase 19 as demonstrator services across clinical care, prevention, infectious diseases, and population health. Services range from education, reminders, reporting, and peer support, to epidemiologic reporting, and care management with phone communication and messages. Key achievements include timely adherence to treatment and appointments, clinical effectiveness of treatment reminders, increased vaccination coverage and uptake of screening, and capacity for efficient disease surveillance. We discuss methodologies of delivery and evaluation of mobile-phone-based mHealth in LMIC, including service design, social context, and environmental factors to success. Demonstrated promises using mobile phones in the poorest countries encourage a future in which IMIA takes a lead role in leveraging mHealth for citizen empowerment through Consumer Health Informatics.

This has many implications for informatics, not only in terms of implementing and evaluating information systems, but also for the work and training of informatics researchers and professionals. This article addresses the question: What do biomedical and health informaticians working in analytics and Big Data need to know? We hypothesize a set of skills that we hope will be discussed among academic and other informaticians. The set of skills includes: Programming - especially with data-oriented tools, such as SQL and statistical programming languages; Statistics - working knowledge to apply tools and techniques; Domain knowledge - depending on one's area of work, bioscience or health care; and Communication - being able to understand needs of people and organizations, and articulate results back to them. Biomedical and health informatics educational programs must introduce concepts of analytics, Big Data, and the underlying skills to use and apply them into their curricula. The development of new coursework should focus on those who will become experts, with training aiming to provide skills in \"deep analytical talent\" as well as those who need knowledge to support such individuals. ","290":"Address current topics in consumer health informatics. Literature review. Current health care delivery systems need to be more effective in the management of chronic conditions as the population turns older and experiences escalating chronic illness that threatens to consume more health care resources than countries can afford. Most health care systems are positioned poorly to accommodate this. Meanwhile, the availability of ever more powerful and cheaper information and communication technology, both for professionals and consumers, has raised the capacity to gather and process information, communicate more effectively, and monitor the quality of care processes. Adapting health care systems to serve current and future needs requires new streams of data to enable better self-management, improve shared decision making, and provide more virtual care. Changes in reimbursement for health care services, increased adoption of relevant technologies, patient engagement, and calls for data transparency raise the importance of patient-generated health information, remote monitoring, non-visit based care, and other innovative care approaches that foster more frequent contact with patients and better management of chronic conditions.

A comprehensive review of medical informatics literature was performed to select some of the most interesting papers of KRM and natural language processing (NLP) published in 2013. Four articles were selected, one focuses on Electronic Health Record (EHR) interoperability for clinical pathway personalization based on structured data. The other three focus on NLP (corpus creation, de-identification, and co-reference resolution) and highlight the increase in NLP tools performances. NLP tools are close to being seriously concurrent to humans in some annotation tasks. Their use could increase drastically the amount of data usable for meaningful use of EHR.

Two literature reviews were performed by the two section editors from bibliographic databases with a focus on clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) and computer provider order entry in order to select a list of candidate best papers to be peer-reviewed by external reviewers. The full review process highlighted three papers, illustrating current trends in the domain of clinical decision support. The first trend is the development of theoretical approaches for CDSSs, and is exemplified by a paper proposing the integration of family histories and pedigrees in a CDSS. The second trend is illustrated by well-designed CDSSs, showing good theoretical performances and acceptance, while failing to show a clinical impact. An example is given with a paper reporting on scorecards aiming to reduce adverse drug events. The third trend is represented by research works that try to understand the limits of CDSS use, for instance by analyzing interactions between general practitioners, patients, and a CDSS. CDSSs can achieve good theoretical results in terms of sensibility and specificity, as well as a good acceptance, but evaluations often fail to demonstrate a clinical impact. Future research is needed to better understand the causes of this observation and imagine new effective solutions for CDSS implementation.

Some problems in healthcare and strategies for change are described. It is argued that change requires better decisions, which, in turn, require better use of the many kinds of healthcare information. Analytic resources that address each of the information challenges are described. Examples of the role of each of the resources are given. There are powerful analytic tools that utilize the various kinds of big data in healthcare to help clinicians make more personalized, evidenced-based decisions. Such resources can extract relevant information and provide insights that clinicians can use to make evidence-supported decisions. There are early suggestions that these resources have clinical value. As with all analytic tools, they are limited by the amount and quality of data. Big data is an inevitable part of the future of healthcare. There is a compelling need to manage and use big data to make better decisions to support the transformation of healthcare to the personalized, evidence-supported model of the future. Cognitive computing resources are necessary to manage the challenges in employing big data in healthcare. Such tools have been and are being developed.

A set of MeSH keywords provided by experts was used. Big Data are collections of large and complex datasets which have the potential to capture the whole variability of a study population. More and more innovative sensors are emerging, allowing to enrich these big databases. However they become more and more challenging to process (i.e. capture, store, search, share, transfer, exploit) because traditional tools are not adapted anymore. This review shows that it is necessary not only to develop new tools specifically designed for Big Data, but also to evaluate their performance on such large datasets. ","295":"To discuss how current research in the area of smart homes and ambient assisted living will be influenced by the use of big data. A scoping review of literature published in scientific journals and conference proceedings was performed, focusing on smart homes, ambient assisted living and big data over the years 2011-2014. The health and social care market has lagged behind other markets when it comes to the introduction of innovative IT solutions and the market faces a number of challenges as the use of big data will increase. First, there is a need for a sustainable and trustful information chain where the needed information can be transferred from all producers to all consumers in a structured way. Second, there is a need for big data strategies and policies to manage the new situation where information is handled and transferred independently of the place of the expertise. Finally, there is a possibility to develop new and innovative business models for a market that supports cloud computing, social media, crowdsourcing etc. The interdisciplinary area of big data, smart homes and ambient assisted living is no longer only of interest for IT developers, it is also of interest for decision makers as customers make more informed choices among today's services. In the future it will be of importance to make information usable for managers and improve decision making, tailor smart home services based on big data, develop new business models, increase competition and identify policies to ensure privacy, security and liability.

The article draws on the scientific literature to support the opinions presented by the IMIA Wearable Sensors in Healthcare Working Group. The following is discussed: the potential for wearable sensors to generate big data; how complementary technologies, such as a smartphone, will augment the concept of a wearable sensor and alter the nature of the monitoring data created; how standards would enable sharing of data and advance scientific progress. Importantly, attention is drawn to statistical inference problems for which big datasets provide little assistance, or may hinder the identification of a useful solution. Finally, a discussion is presented on risks to privacy and possible negative consequences arising from intensive wearable sensor monitoring. Wearable sensors systems have the potential to generate datasets which are currently beyond our capabilities to easily organize and interpret. In order to successfully utilize wearable sensor data to infer wellbeing, and enable proactive health management, standards and ontologies must be developed which allow for data to be shared between research groups and between commercial systems, promoting the integration of these data into health information systems. However, policy and regulation will be required to ensure that the detailed nature of wearable sensor data is not misused to invade privacies or prejudice against individuals. ","297":"The goal of this paper is to review some important issues occurring during the past year in Implantable devices. First cardiac implantable device was proposed to maintain an adequate heart rate, either because the heart's natural pacemaker is not fast enough, or there is a block in the heart's electrical conduction system. During the last forty years, pacemakers have evolved considerably and become programmable and allow to configure specific patient optimum pacing modes. Various technological aspects (electrodes, connectors, algorithms diagnosis, therapies, ...) have been progressed and cardiac implants address several clinical applications: management of arrhythmias, cardioversion \/ defibrillation and cardiac resynchronization therapy. Observed progress was the miniaturization of device, increased longevity, coupled with efficient pacing functions, multisite pacing modes, leadless pacing and also a better recognition of supraventricular or ventricular tachycardia's in order to deliver appropriate therapy. Subcutaneous implant, new modes of stimulation (leadless implant or ultrasound lead), quadripolar lead and new sensor or new algorithm for the hemodynamic management are introduced and briefly described. Each times, the main result occurring during the two past years are underlined and repositioned from the history, remaining limitations are also addressed.

The articles were identified based on keywords and initially selected for further study based on titles and abstracts. A grounded theory-inspired method was applied to categorize the selected articles in main focus areas. Subsequent frequency analysis was performed on the identified articles in areas of infectious and non-infectious diseases and continent of origin. A total of 865 articles were included. Four conceptual domains within GIS in health sciences comprise the framework: spatial analysis of disease, spatial analysis of health service planning, public health, health technologies and tools. Frequency analysis by disease status and location show that malaria and schistosomiasis are the most commonly analyzed infectious diseases where cancer and asthma are the most frequently analyzed non-infectious diseases. Across categories, articles from North America predominate, and in the category of spatial analysis of diseases an equal number of studies concern Asia. Spatial analysis of diseases and health service planning are well-established research areas.

Standardization has been organized by standard development organizations (SDOs) such as ISO (International Organization for Standardization), CEN (European Committee for Standardization), IHE (Integrating the Healthcare Enterprise), and HL7 (Health Level 7), etc. This paper reports the status of these SDOs' activities. In this workshop, we reviewed the past activities and the current situation of standardization in health care informatics with the standard development organizations such as ISO, CEN, IHE, and HL7. Then we discussed the future direction of standardization in health informatics toward \"future medicine\" based on standardized technologies. We could share the status of each SDO through exchange of opinions in the workshop. Some WHO members joined our discussion to support this constructive activity. At this meeting, the workshop speakers have been appointed as new members of the IMIA working groups of Standards in Health Care Informatics (WG16). We could reach to the conclusion that we collaborate for the international standardization in health informatics toward \"future medicine\". ","301":"Implementation of Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems continues to expand. The massive number of patient encounters results in high amounts of stored data. Transforming clinical data into knowledge to improve patient care has been the goal of biomedical informatics professionals for many decades, and this work is now increasingly recognized outside our field. In reviewing the literature for the past three years, we focus on \"big data\" in the context of EHR systems and we report on some examples of how secondary use of data has been put into practice. We searched PubMed database for articles from January 1, 2011 to November 1, 2013. We initiated the search with keywords related to \"big data\" and EHR. We identified relevant articles and additional keywords from the retrieved articles were added. Based on the new keywords, more articles were retrieved and we manually narrowed down the set utilizing predefined inclusion and exclusion criteria. Our final review includes articles categorized into the themes of data mining (pharmacovigilance, phenotyping, natural language processing), data application and integration (clinical decision support, personal monitoring, social media), and privacy and security. The increasing adoption of EHR systems worldwide makes it possible to capture large amounts of clinical data. There is an increasing number of articles addressing the theme of \"big data\", and the concepts associated with these articles vary.

Papers were evaluated based on pre-defined exclusion and inclusion criteria from their title, keywords, and abstract to select 15 candidate best papers, finally reviewed by 4 external reviewers using a standard evaluation grid. Five papers were selected as best papers to illustrate how human factors approaches can improve EHR adoption and design. Among other contributions, these works: (i) make use of the observational and analysis methodologies of social and cognitive sciences to understand clinicians' attitudes towards EHRs, EHR use patterns, and impact on care processes, workflows, information exchange, and coordination of care; (ii) take into account macro- (environmental) and meso- (organizational) level factors to analyze EHR adoption or lack thereof; (iii) highlight the need for qualitative studies to analyze the unexpected side effects of EHRs on cognitive and work processes as well as the persistent use of paper. Selected papers tend to demonstrate that HFOI approaches and methodologies are essential to bridge the gap between EHR systems and end users, and to reduce regularly reported adoption failures and unexpected consequences. ","303":"While big data offers enormous potential for improving healthcare delivery, many of the existing claims concerning big data in healthcare are based on anecdotal reports and theoretical vision papers, rather than scientific evidence based on empirical research. Historically, the implementation of health information technology has resulted in unintended consequences at the individual, organizational and social levels, but these unintended consequences of collecting data have remained unaddressed in the literature on big data. The objective of this paper is to provide insights into big data from the perspective of people, social and organizational considerations. We draw upon the concept of persona to define the digital persona as the intersection of data, tasks and context for different user groups. We then describe how the digital persona can serve as a framework to understanding sociotechnical considerations of big data implementation. We then discuss the digital persona in the context of micro, meso and macro user groups across the 3 Vs of big data. We provide insights into the potential benefits and challenges of applying big data approaches to healthcare as well as how to position these approaches to achieve health system objectives such as patient safety or patient-engaged care delivery. We also provide a framework for defining the digital persona at a micro, meso and macro level to help understand the user contexts of big data solutions.

Several different methods are discussed in case studies from Denmark, Finland and Canada. They range from small scale qualitative studies involving usability testing of systems to larger scale national level questionnaire studies aimed at assessing the use and usability of health information systems by entire groups of health professionals. It was found that regional and national usability studies can complement smaller scale usability studies, and that they are needed in order to understand larger trends regarding system usability. Despite adoption of EHRs, many health professionals rate the usability of the systems as low. A range of usability issues have been noted when data is collected on a large scale through use of widely distributed questionnaires and websites designed to monitor user perceptions of usability. As health information systems are deployed on a widespread basis, studies that examine systems used regionally or nationally are required. In addition, collection of large scale data on the usability of specific IT products is needed in order to complement smaller scale studies of specific systems.

We reviewed literature (2007-2013) on the use of HFE approaches in healthcare settings, from databases such as Pubmed, CINAHL, and Cochran. Based on the review, we discuss the systems-oriented models, their use in the evaluation of HIT, and examples of their use in the evaluation of EHR systems, clinical workflow processes, and medication errors. We also discuss the opportunities for better integrating HFE methods within biomedical informatics research and its potential advantages. The use of HFE methods is still in its infancy - better integration of HFE within the design lifecycle, and quality improvement efforts can further the ability of informatics researchers to address the key concerns regarding the complexity in clinical settings and develop HIT solutions that are designed within the social fabric of the considered setting.

We discuss sources of big datasets, survey infrastructures for big data storage and big data processing, and describe the main challenges that arise when analyzing big data. The life and biomedical sciences are massively contributing to the big data revolution through secondary use of data that were collected during routine care and through new data sources such as social media. Efficient processing of big datasets is typically achieved by distributing computation over a cluster of computers. Data analysts should be aware of pitfalls related to big data such as bias in routine care data and the risk of false-positive findings in high-dimensional datasets.

A non-systematic review of the literature was performed in PubMed and Google Scholar. The following keywords were used: \"big data\", \"developing countries\", \"data mining\", \"health information systems\", and \"computing methodologies\". A thematic review of selected articles was performed. There are challenges when implementing any Big Data program including exponential growth of data, special infrastructure needs, need for a trained workforce, need to agree on interoperability standards, privacy and security issues, and the need to include people, processes, and policies to ensure their adoption.

Big data generated by increasingly affordable personalised computing, and from pervasive computing devices is rapidly growing and low cost, high volume, cloud computing makes the processing of these data inexpensive. To describe how big data and related analytical methods might be applied to assess the benefits and risks of vaccines. We reviewed the literature on the use of big data to improve health, applied to generic vaccine use cases, that illustrate benefits and risks of vaccination. We defined a use case as the interaction between a user and an information system to achieve a goal. We used flu vaccination and pre-school childhood immunisation as exemplars. We reviewed three big data use cases relevant to assessing vaccine benefits and risks: (i) Big data processing using crowdsourcing, distributed big data processing, and predictive analytics, (ii) Data integration from heterogeneous big data sources, e.g. the increasing range of devices in the \"internet of things\", and (iii) Real-time monitoring for the direct monitoring of epidemics as well as vaccine effects via social media and other data sources.

The concept of analytics aims to understand data. We set out to portray and discuss perspectives of the evolving use of Big Data in science and healthcare and, to examine some of the opportunities and challenges. A literature review was conducted to highlight the implications associated with the use of Big Data in scientific research and healthcare innovations, both on a large and small scale. Scientists and health-care providers may learn from one another when it comes to understanding the value of Big Data and analytics. Small data, derived by patients and consumers, also requires analytics to become actionable. Connectivism provides a framework for the use of Big Data and analytics in the areas of science and healthcare. This theory assists individuals to recognize and synthesize how human connections are driving the increase in data. Despite the volume and velocity of Big Data, it is truly about technology connecting humans and assisting them to construct knowledge in new ways. Concluding Thoughts: The concept of Big Data and associated analytics are to be taken seriously when approaching the use of vast volumes of both structured and unstructured data in science and health-care. Future exploration of issues surrounding data privacy, confidentiality, and education are needed. A greater focus on data from social media, the quantified self-movement, and the application of analytics to \"small data\" would also be useful.

Survey of trends in this work, and exploration of literature describing how large-scale structured and unstructured data sources are being used to support applications from clinical decision making and health policy, to drug design and pharmacovigilance, and further to systems biology and genetics. The survey highlights ongoing development of powerful new methods for turning that large-scale, and often complex, data into information that provides new insights into human health, in a range of different areas. Consideration of this body of work identifies several important paradigm shifts that are facilitated by Big Data resources and methods: in clinical and translational research, from hypothesis-driven research to data-driven research, and in medicine, from evidence-based practice to practice-based evidence. The increasing scale and availability of large quantities of health data require strategies for data management, data linkage, and data integration beyond the limits of many existing information systems, and substantial effort is underway to meet those needs. As our ability to make sense of that data improves, the value of the data will continue to increase. Health systems, genetics and genomics, population and public health; all areas of biomedicine stand to benefit from Big Data and the associated technologies.

A brief overview of the 2014 special topic, Big Data - Smart Health Strategies, and an outline of the novel publishing model is provided in conjunction with a call for proposals to celebrate the 25th anniversary of the Yearbook. 'Big Data' has become the latest buzzword in informatics and promise new approaches and interventions that can improve health, well-being, and quality of life. This edition of the Yearbook acknowledges the fact that we just started to explore the opportunities that 'Big Data' will bring. However, it will become apparent to the reader that its pervasive nature has invaded all aspects of biomedical informatics - some to a higher degree than others. It was our goal to provide a comprehensive view at the state of 'Big Data' today, explore its strengths and weaknesses, as well as its risks, discuss emerging trends, tools, and applications, and stimulate the development of the field through the aggregation of excellent survey papers and working group contributions to the topic. For the first time in history will the IMIA Yearbook be published in an open access online format allowing a broader readership especially in resource poor countries. For the first time, thanks to the online format, will the IMIA Yearbook be published twice in the year, with two different tracks of papers. We anticipate that the important role of the IMIA yearbook will further increase with these changes just in time for its 25th anniversary in 2016.

","319":"Big data are receiving an increasing attention in biomedicine and healthcare. It is therefore important to understand the reason why big data are assuming a crucial role for the biomedical informatics community. The capability of handling big data is becoming an enabler to carry out unprecedented research studies and to implement new models of healthcare delivery. Therefore, it is first necessary to deeply understand the four elements that constitute big data, namely Volume, Variety, Velocity, and Veracity, and their meaning in practice. Then, it is mandatory to understand where big data are present, and where they can be beneficially collected. There are research fields, such as translational bioinformatics, which need to rely on big data technologies to withstand the shock wave of data that is generated every day. Other areas, ranging from epidemiology to clinical care, can benefit from the exploitation of the large amounts of data that are nowadays available, from personal monitoring to primary care. However, building big data-enabled systems carries on relevant implications in terms of reproducibility of research studies and management of privacy and data access; proper actions should be taken to deal with these issues. An interesting consequence of the big data scenario is the availability of new software, methods, and tools, such as map-reduce, cloud computing, and concept drift machine learning algorithms, which will not only contribute to big data research, but may be beneficial in many biomedical informatics applications. The way forward with the big data opportunity will require properly applied engineering principles to design studies and applications, to avoid preconceptions or over-enthusiasms, to fully exploit the available technologies, and to improve data processing and data management regulations. ","320":"This paper discusses the early history and development of a clinical analyser system in Sweden (AutoChemist, 1965). It highlights the importance of such high capacity system both for clinical use and health care screening. The device was developed to assure the quality of results and to automatically handle the orders, store the results in digital form for later statistical analyses and distribute the results to the patients' physicians by using the computer used for the analyser. The most important result of the construction of an analyser able to produce analytical results on a mass scale was the development of a mechanical multi-channel analyser for clinical laboratories that handled discrete sample technology and could prevent carry-over to the next test samples while incorporating computer technology to improve the quality of test results. The AutoChemist could handle 135 samples per hour in an 8-hour shift and up to 24 possible analyses channels resulting in 3,200 results per hour. Later versions would double this capacity. Some customers used the equipment 24 hours per day. With a capacity of 3,000 to 6,000 analyses per hour, pneumatic driven pipettes, special units for corrosive liquids or special activities, and an integrated computer, the AutoChemist system was unique and the largest of its kind for many years. Its follower - The AutoChemist PRISMA (PRogrammable Individually Selective Modular Analyzer) - was smaller in size but had a higher capacity. Both analysers established new standards of operation for clinical laboratories and encouraged others to use new technologies for building new analysers.

From the many lessons learned during my professional career, I tried to identify a fair sampling of such factors. On the occasion of giving the IMIA Award of Excellence lecture during MedInfo 2013, they were presented for discussion. Sixteen determining factors (df) have been identified: early identification and promotion (df1), appropriate education (df2), stimulating persons and environments (df3), sufficient time and backtracking opportunities (df4), breadth of medical informatics competencies (df5), considering the necessary preconditions for good medical informatics research (df6), easy access to high-quality knowledge (df7), sufficient scientific career opportunities (df8), appropriate conditions for sustainable research (df9), ability to communicate and to solve problems (df10), as well as to convey research results (df11) in a highly inter- and multidisciplinary environment, ability to think for all and, when needed, taking the lead (df12), always staying unbiased (df13), always keeping doubt (df14), but also always trying to provide solutions (df15), and, finally, being aware that life is more (df16). Medical Informatics is an inter- and multidisciplinary discipline \"avant la lettre\". Compared to monodisciplinary research, inter- and multidisciplinary research does not only provide significant opportunities for solving major problems in science and in society. It also faces considerable additional challenges for medical informatics as a scientific field. The determining factors, presented here, are in my opinion crucial for conducting successful research and for developing a research career. Since medical informatics as a field has today become an important driving force for research progress, especially in biomedicine and health care, but also in fields like computer science, it may be helpful to consider such factors in relation with research and education in our discipline.

It focuses on the topics of medical informatics education and decision support methods and systems. Several conferences held in Czechoslovakia and in the Czech Republic organized in cooperation with IMIA or EFMI are described. Support of European Union and Czech agencies in several European and national projects focused on medical informatics topics highly contributed to medical informatics development in Czechoslovakia and the Czech Republic and to the establishment of the European Center for Medical Informatics, Statistics and Epidemiology as the joint workplace of Charles University in Prague and Academy of Sciences of the Czech Republic in 1994.

Specifically, it aims to give a general overview of the Moroccan healthcare system, the challenges it is facing, and the efforts undertaken by the informatics community and Moroccan government in terms of education, research and practice to reform the country's health sector. Through the experience of establishing Medical Informatics as a medical specialty in 2008, creating a Moroccan Medical Informatics Association in 2010 and holding a first national congress took place in April 2012, the authors present their assessment of some important priorities for health informatics in Morocco. These Moroccan initiatives are facilitating collaboration in education, research, and implementation of clinical information systems. In particular, the stakeholders have recognized the need for a national coordinator office and the development of a national framework for standards and interoperability. For developing countries like Morocco, new health IT approaches like mobile health and trans-media health advertising could help optimize scarce resources, improve access to rural areas and focus on the most prevalent health problems, optimizing health care access, quality, and cost for Morocco population.

An iterative \"scoping review\" of the literature published in scientific journals and conference proceedings that are relevant to CRI, from late 2009 to early 2013. 212 articles were identified, and 64 were selected to illustrate recent advances in the field. Based on those, six categories of CRI activity were identified: Data and Knowledge Management, Discovery and Standards; Clinical Data Re-Use for Research; Researcher Support and Resources; Participant Recruitment; Patients\/Consumers and CRI; Policy, Regulatory and Fiscal Matters. This survey demonstrates that the field of CRI has matured and is now well established. The ongoing work is essential to overcome many of the challenges the clinical research enterprise is facing and more work is needed. Even as work continues to establish necessary infrastructure, methods, and best practices, CRI researchers should strive for more rigorous study designs to evaluate the impacts of the work in the field. There is little doubt that the field is poised for rapid growth, and that the CRI literature will continue to reflect that growth in years to come. ","328":"To summarize excellent current research in the field of Bioinformatics and Translational Informatics with application in the health domain and evidence-based medicine. We provide a synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2013, from which we attempt to derive a synthetic overview of current and future activities in the field. Three steps of selection were performed by querying PubMed and Web of Science. A first set of 5,549 articles was refined into a second set of 1,272 articles from which 15 articles were retained for peer-review. The selection and evaluation process of this Yearbook's section on Bioinformatics and Translational Informatics yielded four excellent articles regarding the Human Genome and Medicine. Exploiting genomic data depends on having the appropriate reference annotation available. In the first article, the goal of the GENCODE Consortium is to produce and publish The GENCODE human reference gene set. As a result it is composed by merged manual and automatic annotations, which are frequently updated from public experimental databases. The quality of genome sequencing is platform-dependant. In the second article, a generic database independent from the sequencing technologies, Huvariome, can help to identify errors and inconsistencies in sequencing. To understand complex diseases of patients it will be of great importance to detect rare gene variants. This is the aim of the third study. Finally, in the last article, the plasma's DNA of healthy individual and patients suffering from cancer is compared. The current research activities attest to the continuous convergence of Bioinformatics and Medical Informatics for clinical practice. For instance, a direct use of high throughput sequencing technologies for patients could aid the diagnosis of complex diseases (such as cancer) without invasive surgery (such as biopsy) but only with blood analysis. However, ongoing genomic tests will generate massive amounts of data and will imply new trends in the near future: \"Big Data\" and smart health management.

Two major themes emerged as areas of focus in 2012: (1) integration of genomic data into electronic health records; and (2) determining the clinical utility of genomic tests. Significant advances are being made towards the integration of genomic data such that they may useful for clinical decision making. While the short term advances will likely still be seen in clinically valid genotype-phenotype research, there have been promising advances towards developing genomic tests that may be of clinical utility in the near future. ","330":"To provide an overview of outstanding current research conducted in Education and Consumer Informatics. Synopsis of the articles on education and consumer health informatics published in 2012 and selected for the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2013. Architecture of monitoring or telehealth information systems for patients with chronic disease must include wireless devices to aid in the collection of personal data. Data acquisition technologies have an impact on patients' willingness to participate in telehealth programmes. Patients are more likely to prefer mobile applications over web-based applications. Social media is widely used by clinicians. Especially younger clinicians use it for personal purposes and for reference materials retrieval. Questions remain on optimal training requirements and on the effects on clinician behavior and on patient outcomes. A high level of e-Health literacy by patients will promote increased adoption and utilization of personal health records. The selected articles highlight the need for training of clinicians to become aware of existing telehealth systems, in order to correctly inform and guide patients to take part in telehealth systems and adopt personal healthcare records (PHR). ","331":"As health information is becoming increasingly accessible, social media offers ample opportunities to track, be informed, share and promote health. These authors explore how social media and holistic care may work together; more specifically however, our objective is to document, from different perspectives, how social networks have impacted, supported and helped sustain holistic self-participatory care. A literature review was performed to investigate the use of social media for promoting health in general and complementary alternative care. We also explore a case study of an intervention for improving the health of Greek senior citizens through digital and other means. The Health Belief Model provides a framework for assessing the benefits of social media interventions in promoting comprehensive participatory self-care. Some interventions are particularly effective when integrating social media with real-world encounters. Yet not all social media tools are evidence-based and efficacious. Interestingly, social media is also used to elicit patient ratings of treatments (e.g., for depression), often demonstrating the effectiveness of complementary treatments, such as yoga and mindfulness meditation. To facilitate the use of social media for the promotion of complementary alternative medicine through self-quantification, social connectedness and sharing of experiences, exploration of concrete and abstract ideas are presented here within. The main mechanisms by which social support may help improve health - emotional support, an ability to share experiences, and non-hierarchal roles, emphasizing reciprocity in giving and receiving support - are integral to social media and provide great hope for its effective use. ","332":"The rapid evolution in the world-wide use of Social Media tools suggests the emergence of a global phenomenon that may have implications in the Personal Health and Consumer Health Informatics domains. However the impact of these tools on health outcomes is not known. The goal of this research was to review the randomized controlled trial (RCT) evidence of the impact of health oriented Social Media informatics tools on health outcomes. Evaluations of Social Media consumer health tools were systematically reviewed. Research was limited to studies published in the English language, published in Medline, published in the calendar year 2012 and limited to studies that utilized a RCT methodological design. Two high quality Randomized Controlled Trials among over 600 articles published in Medline were identified. These studies indicate that Social Media interventions may be able to significantly improve pain control among patients with chronic pain and enhance weight loss maintenance among individuals attempting to lose weight. Significantly more research needs to be done to confirm these early findings, evaluate additional health outcomes and further evaluate emerging health oriented Social Media interventions. Chronic pain and weight control have both socially oriented determinants. These studies suggest that understanding the social component of a disease may ultimately provide novel therapeutic targets and socio-clinical interventional strategies.

A synopsis of the four selected articles for the IMIA Yearbook 2013 KRM section is provided, as well as highlights of current KRM trends, in particular, of the semantic web in daily health practice. The manual selection was performed in three stages: first a set of 3,106 articles, then a second set of 86 articles followed by a third set of 15 articles, and finally the last set of four chosen articles. Among the four selected articles (see Table 1), one focuses on knowledge engineering to prevent adverse drug events; the objective of the second is to propose mappings between clinical archetypes and SNOMED CT in the context of clinical practice; the third presents an ontology to create a question-answering system; the fourth describes a biomonitoring network based on semantic web technologies. These four articles clearly indicate that the health semantic web has become a part of daily practice of health professionals since 2012. In the review of the second set of 86 articles, the same topics included in the previous IMIA yearbook remain active research fields: Knowledge extraction, automatic indexing, information retrieval, natural language processing, management of health terminologies and ontologies. ","334":"Most chronic diseases are managed in primary and ambulatory care. The chronic care model (CCM) suggests a wide range of community, technological, team and patient factors contribute to effective chronic disease management. Ontologies have the capability to enable formalised linkage of heterogeneous data sources as might be found across the elements of the CCM. To describe the evidence base for using ontologies and other semantic integration methods to support chronic disease management. We reviewed the evidence-base for the use of ontologies and other semantic integration methods within and across the elements of the CCM. We report them using a realist review describing the context in which the mechanism was applied, and any outcome measures. Most evidence was descriptive with an almost complete absence of empirical research and important gaps in the evidence-base. We found some use of ontologies and semantic integration methods for community support of the medical home and for care in the community. Ubiquitous information technology (IT) and other IT tools were deployed to support self-management support, use of shared registries, health behavioural models and knowledge discovery tools to improve delivery system design. Data quality issues restricted the use of clinical data; however there was an increased use of interoperable data and health system integration. Ontologies and semantic integration methods are emergent with limited evidence-base for their implementation. However, they have the potential to integrate the disparate community wide data sources to provide the information necessary for effective chronic disease management. ","335":"Medical decision support and other intelligent applications in the life sciences depend on increasing amounts of digital information. Knowledge bases as well as formal ontologies are being used to organize biomedical knowledge and data. However, these two kinds of artefacts are not always clearly distinguished. Whereas the popular RDF(S) standard provides an intuitive triple-based representation, it is semantically weak. Description logics based ontology languages like OWL-DL carry a clear-cut semantics, but they are computationally expensive, and they are often misinterpreted to encode all kinds of statements, including those which are not ontological. We distinguish four kinds of statements needed to comprehensively represent domain knowledge: universal statements, terminological statements, statements about particulars and contingent statements. We argue that the task of formal ontologies is solely to represent universal statements, while the non-ontological kinds of statements can nevertheless be connected with ontological representations. To illustrate these four types of representations, we use a running example from parasitology. We finally formulate recommendations for semantically adequate ontologies that can efficiently be used as a stable framework for more context-dependent biomedical knowledge representation and reasoning applications like clinical decision support systems. ","336":"To summarize excellent research and to select best papers published in 2012 in the field of computer-based decision support in healthcare. A bibliographic search focused on clinical decision support systems (CDSSs) and computer provider order entry was performed, followed by a double-blind literature review. The review process yielded six papers, illustrating various aspects of clinical decision support. The first paper is a systematic review of CDSS intervention trials in real settings, and considers different types of possible outcomes. It emphasizes the heterogeneity of studies and confirms that CDSSs can improve process measures but that evidence lacks for other types of outcomes, especially clinical or economic. Four other papers tackle the safety of drug prescribing and show that CDSSs can be efficient in reducing prescription errors. The sixth paper exemplifies the growing role of ontological resources which can be used for several applications including decision support. CDSS research has to be continuously developed and assessed. The wide variety of systems and of interventions limits the understanding of factors of success of CDSS implementations. A standardization in the characterization of CDSSs and of intervention trial reporting will help to overcome this obstacle.

Issues related to knowledge capture and synthesis, problems in knowledge transformation at the interface between knowledge authors and CDS developers, and problems specific to local CDS design and implementation can interfere with CDS development. Best practices, tools and techniques to manage them are described. CDS, when used well, can be effective, but further research is needed for it to reach its full potential.

Methods discussed are considered on a continuum from traditional laboratory-based usability testing to clinical simulations. Clinical simulations can be conducted in a simulation laboratory and they can also be conducted in real-world settings. The clinical simulation approach attempts to bring the dimension of clinical context into stronger focus. This involves testing of systems with representative users doing representative tasks, in representative settings\/environments. Application of methods where realistic clinical scenarios are used to drive the study of users interacting with systems under realistic conditions and settings can lead to identification of problems and issues with systems that may not be detected using traditional usability engineering methods. In conducting such studies, careful consideration is needed in creating ecologically valid test scenarios. The evidence obtained from such evaluation can be used to improve both the usability and safety of HIT. In addition, recent work has shown that clinical simulations, in particular those conducted in-situ, can lead to considerable benefits when compared to the costs of running such studies.

The authors have selected the most prominent of these recent regulations and initiatives, which rely on validated HF and usability methods and concepts and aim at enhancing the specific process of identification and prevention of technology-induced errors throughout the lifecycle of HIT. The analysis highlights several points of consensus: 1) safety initiatives or regulations applicable to Medical Devices (MD) tend to extend to HIT, 2) Usability is considered a fundamental dimension of HIT safety, 3) HF\/Usability methods and the overall Human Centred Design (HCD) approach are considered efficient solutions to ensure the design of safe and usable HIT. However, it appears that MD manufacturers, and a fortiori HIT designers and developers are still far from being able to routinely apply HCD to their products. On the research side, we need to analyze manufacturers' difficulties with the application of the HCD process and imposed standards. For each given category of HIT, we need to identify the fundamental usability dimensions and design principles likely to impact patient safety independently of workplace settings or organizations.

Synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2012 and an invited opinion paper written by leading scientists in this field. Evidence based health informatics is an important and ubiquitous trend in biomedical informatics. However, this research field has to be enhanced even further and, more importantly, achievements have to be put in practice. ","350":"To present the importance of Evidence-based Health Informatics (EBHI) and the ethical imperative of this approach; to highlight the work of the IMIA Working Group on Technology Assessment and Quality Improvement and the EFMI Working Group on Assessment of Health Information Systems; and to introduce the further important evaluation and evidence aspects being addressed. Reviews of IMIA, EFMA and other initiatives, together with literature reviews on evaluation methods and on published systematic reviews. Presentation of the rationale for the health informatics domain to adopt a scientific approach by assessing impact, avoiding harm, and empirically demonstrating benefit and best use; reporting of the origins and rationale of the IMIA- and EQUATOR-endorsed Statement on Reporting of Evaluation Studies in Health Informatics (STARE-HI) and of the IMIA WG's Guideline for Good Evaluation Practice in Health Informatics (GEP-HI); presentation of other initiatives for objective evaluation; and outlining of further work in hand on usability and indicators; together with the case for development of relevant evaluation methods in newer applications such as telemedicine. The focus is on scientific evaluation as a reliable source of evidence, and on structured presentation of results to enable easy retrieval of evidence. EBHI is feasible, necessary for efficiency and safety, and ethically essential. Given the significant impact of health informatics on health systems, care delivery and personal health, it is vital that cultures change to insist on evidence-based policies and investment, and that emergent global moves for this are supported. ","351":"An evidence-base is important for medicine and health informatics. Despite numerous publications showing the benefits of health informatics, the emergence of health information systems in developing countries has been slower than expected. The aim of this paper is to identify systematic reviews on the domain of health informatics in developing countries, and classify the different types of applications covered. A systematic review of reviews was conducted. The literature search spanned the time period between 2000 and 2012 and included PubMed, EMBASE, CINAHL, Scopus, Cochrane Systematic Reviews, LILACS, and Google Scholar. The search term was 'systematic reviews of health informatics in developing countries', and transparent and systematic procedures were applied to limit bias at all stages. Of the 982 identified articles, only 10 met the inclusion criteria and one more article was added in a second manual search, resulting in a total of 11 systematic reviews for the analysis. Although it was difficult to find high quality resources on the selected domain, the best evidence available allowed us to generate this report and create an incipient review of the state of the art in health informatics in the developing countries. More studies will be needed to optimize the results. ","352":"Issues related to lack of system usability and potential safety hazards continue to be reported in the health information technology (HIT) literature. Usability engineering methods are increasingly used to ensure improved system usability and they are also beginning to be applied more widely for ensuring the safety of HIT applications. These methods are being used in the design and implementation of many HIT systems. In this paper we describe evidence-based approaches to applying usability engineering methods. A multi-phased approach to ensuring system usability and safety in healthcare is described. Usability inspection methods are first described including the development of evidence-based safety heuristics for HIT. Laboratory-based usability testing is then conducted under artificial conditions to test if a system has any base level usability problems that need to be corrected. Usability problems that are detected are corrected and then a new phase is initiated where the system is tested under more realistic conditions using clinical simulations. This phase may involve testing the system with simulated patients. Finally, an additional phase may be conducted, involving a naturalistic study of system use under real-world clinical conditions. The methods described have been employed in the analysis of the usability and safety of a wide range of HIT applications, including electronic health record systems, decision support systems and consumer health applications. It has been found that at least usability inspection and usability testing should be applied prior to the widespread release of HIT. However, wherever possible, additional layers of testing involving clinical simulations and a naturalistic evaluation will likely detect usability and safety issues that may not otherwise be detected prior to widespread system release. The framework presented in the paper can be applied in order to develop more usable and safer HIT, based on multiple layers of evidence. ","353":"The field of clinical informatics has expanded substantially in the six decades since its inception. Early research focused on simple demonstrations that health information technology (HIT) such as electronic health records (EHRs), computerized provider order entry (CPOE), and clinical decision support (CDS) systems were feasible and potentially beneficial in clinical practice. In this review, we present recent evidence on clinical informatics in the United States covering three themes: 1) clinical informatics systems and interventions for providers, including EHRs, CPOE, CDS, and health information exchange; 2) consumer health informatics systems, including personal health records and web-based and mobile HIT; and 3) methods and governance for clinical informatics, including EHR usability; data mining, text mining, natural language processing, privacy, and security. Substantial progress has been made in demonstrating that various clinical informatics methodologies and applications improve the structure, process, and outcomes of various facets of the healthcare system. Over the coming years, much more will be expected from the field. As we move past the \"early adopters\" in Rogers' diffusion of innovations' curve through the \"early majority\" and into the \"late majority,\" there will be a crucial need for new research methodologies and clinical applications that have been rigorously demonstrated to work (i.e., to improve health outcomes) in multiple settings with different types of patients and clinicians. ","354":"Is healthcare information technology (HIT) based on evidence of efficacy? Are the trillions of dollars already devoted and in the pipeline for HIT implementations based on systematic evaluations? If evaluated, would those evaluations focus on patient safety, return on investment, clinical efficiency, improved clinician satisfaction, and\/or workflow integration? Do we have reliable evidence of usable interfaces, of successful implementations, of data standards allowing interoperability, of continuous improvement, of responsiveness to clinician feedback? While measurement of HIT's efficacy is extraordinarily difficult-complicated by a myriad of other factors involved in providing healthcare and in organizational dynamics-it is not impossible. But is such evidence required before most implementations? Any implementation? Or are the goals of patient safety and efficiency so self-evident, profoundly desired, and laudable that HIT's beneficence is accepted without rigorous data? Note that lack of systematic evidence does not mean HIT is ineffective. HIT may provide untold benefits even if there is no hard proof of those benefits. We find that HIT is seldom objectively measured, and that evidence of its efficacy is at best spotty, and often influenced by self-promotion. Most measures, especially those associated with cost-benefit analyses, are aspirational or hubris transubstantiated into numbers. ","355":"To provide an editorial introduction to the 2013 IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics with an overview of its contents and contributors. A brief overview of the main theme, and an outline of the purposes, contents, format, and acknowledgment of contributions. Health information technology (HIT) is currently widely implemented to improve healthcare quality and patient safety while reducing costs. Although these benefits are expected and largely advertised, the evidence for these benefits is still missing. Unintended consequences are often reported and some applications have been shown to be wasteful, harmful, and even fatal. Evidence-based health informatics has been defined as \"the conscientious, explicit and judicious use of current best evidence when making decisions about the introduction and operation of information technology in a given health care setting\". The 2013 issue of the IMIA Yearbook highlights important contributions about the significant challenges that arise from the assessment of HIT solutions. Progress towards evidence-based health informatics is identified to elicit what works, what doesn't work, and why. In an environment where resources are limited, budgets lower than in past years, and the need to improve care is becoming ever more pressing, focusing on this topic should guide institutions and providers in the implementation of the best health information technology. This overview of progress and current challenges across the spectrum of the discipline shows many great examples of evidence that have been gathered on the effectiveness of HIT. However, evidence remains limited and a significant work should be conducted to improve the development, testing, and implementation of HIT applications.

They exemplify current key advances in the use of patient information for translational research and health surveillance. First, two proof-of-concept studies demonstrated the cross-institutional and -geographic use of Electronic Health Records (EHR) for clinical trial subjects identification and drug safety signals detection. These reports pave ways to global large-scale population monitoring. Second, there is further evidence on the importance of coupling phenotypic information in EHR with genotypic information (either in biobank or in gene association studies) for new biomedical knowledge discovery. Third, patient data gathered via social media and self-reporting was found to be comparable to existent data and less labor intensive. This alternative means could potentially overcome data collection challenge in cohort and prospective studies. Finally, it can be noted that metagenomic studies are gaining momentum in bioinformatics and system-level analysis of human microbiome sheds important light on certain human diseases.

Many important initiatives, projects, and plans with promising results have been identified. The common themes focus on supporting the individual patients who are playing an increasing central role in their own care decision processes. New collaborative decision making paradigms and information infrastructures are required to ensure effective continuity of care. Human factors and usability are crucial for the successful development and deployment of the relevant systems, tools, and aids. Advances in personalized medicine can be achieved through integrating genomic, phenotypic and other biological, individual, and population level information, and gaining useful insights from building and analyzing biological and other models at multiple levels of abstraction. Therefore, new Information and Communication Technologies and evaluation approaches are needed to effectively manage the scale and complexity of biomedical and health information, and adapt to the changing nature of clinical decision support. Recent research in decision support and knowledge management combines heterogeneous information and personal data to provide cost-effective, calibrated, personalized support in shared decision making at the point of care.

Mobility is a complex construct that cannot be addressed with a single monitoring approach or a single intervention. Instead, tailored interventions that address specific needs and behaviors of individuals and take into consideration preferences of older adults and potentially their social network are needed to effectively enforce positive behavior change. Smart home systems have the ability to capture details of one's daily living that could otherwise not be easily obtained; however, such data repositories alone are not sufficient to improve clinical outcomes if appropriate mechanisms for data mining and analysis, as well as tailored response systems are not in place.

Some of the reasons for the changes in medical informatics are that nobody was able to predict the advent of the personal computer in the 1970s, the world-wide web in 1991, and the public start of the Internet in 1992, but foremost that nobody expected that it was not primarily the hardware or the software, but human factors that would be crucial for successful applications of computers in health care. In the past sometimes unrealistic expectations were held, such as on the impact of medical decision-support systems, or on the overly optimistic contributions of electronic health records. Although the technology is widely available, some applications appear to be far more complex than expected. Health care processes can seldom be fully standardized. Humans enter at least in two very different roles in the loop of information processing: as subjects conducting care - the clinicians - and as subjects that are the objects of care - the patients. CONCLUSIONS. Medical informatics lacks a specific methodology; methods are borrowed from adjacent disciplines such as physics, mathematics and, of course, computer science. Human factors play a major role in applying computers in health care. Everyone pursuing a career in biomedical informatics needs to be very aware of this. It is to be expected that the quality of health care will increasingly be assessed by computer systems to fulfill the requirements of medical evidence.","390":"This paper describes a documentation project to create, collect and preserve previously unavailable sources on informatics in Sweden (including health care as one of 16 subgroups), and making them available on the Web. Time was critical as the personal documentation and artifacts of early pioneers could be irretrievably lost. The criteria for participation were that a person had developed a system in a clinical environment which was used by others prior to 1980. Participants were interviewed and asked for early documentation such as notes, minutes from meetings, drawings, test results and early models - together with related artifacts. The approach included traditional oral history interviews, collection of autobiographies and new self-structuring and time saving methods, such as witness seminars and an Internet-based repository of their recollections (the Writers' Web). The combination of methods obtained new information on system errors, and challenges in reaching the goals due partly to inadequacies of the early technology, and partly to the insufficient understanding of the complexity of the many problems which needed to be solved before a useful electronic patient record could be realized. A very important result was the development of a method to collect information in an easier, faster and much less expensive way than using the traditional scientific method, and still reach results that are qualitative and quantitative for the purpose of documenting the early period of computer-based health care technology. The witness seminars and the Writers' Web yielded especially large amounts of hitherto-unknown information. With all material in one database available to everyone on the Web, it is accessed very frequently - especially by students, researchers, journalists and teachers. Study of the materials explains and clarifies the reasons behind the delays and difficulties that have been encountered in developing electronic patient records, as described in an article [3] published in the IMIA Yearbook 2006.

Since 1993, the Information Technology Institute (ITI) has been leading the development of the Information Technology (IT) professional training and education in Egypt to produce top quality IT professionals who are considered now the backbone of the IT revolution in Egypt. For the past five years, ITI has been adopting the objective of building high caliber health professionals who can effectively serve the ever-growing information society. Academic links have been established with internationally renowned universities, e.g., Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU) in US, University of Leipzig in Germany, in addition those with the Egyptian Fellowship Board in order to enrich ITI Medical Informatics Education and Research. The ITI Biomedical and Health Informatics (BMHI) education and training programs target fresh graduates as well as life-long learners. Therefore, the program's learning objectives are framed within the context of the four specialization tracks: Healthcare Management (HCM), Biomedical Informatics Research (BMIR), Bioinformatics Professional (BIP), and Healthcare Professional (HCP). The ITI BMHI research projects tackle a wide-range of current challenges in this field, such as knowledge management in healthcare, providing tele-consultation services for diagnosis and treatment of infectious diseases for underserved regions in Egypt, and exploring the cultural and educational aspects of Nanoinformatics. Since 2006, ITI has been positively contributing to develop the discipline of BMHI in Egypt in order to support improved healthcare services.

Synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2011. The selection process for this yearbook's section on Bioinformatics results in six excellent articles highlighting the continuous progress towards a better understanding of human phenotype. Compared to the selection in Yearbook 2010, several key advancements can be noted. First, year 2010 marked the inaugural use of a complete human genome in a clinical context. This proof-of-principle study represents a large step towards personalized medicine. Second, there is a clear trend to understand diseases beyond the genome level, namely to include environmental and epigenetic information. Third, an innovative framework making use of the web to harness participant-driven genotype-phenotype information sets a new scene for conducting research in an era where social media plays an increasingly important role. The current literature showed that all pieces are now present to enable a much more comprehensive understanding of human diseases and traits, beyond the highly focused genetic or genomic studies seen previously.

A critical review of articles in the literature of Bioinformatics over the past year. Our main results suggest that Bioinformatics continues to be a major catalyst for progress in Biology and Translational Medicine, as a consequence of new assaying technologies, most pre-dominantly Next Generation Sequencing, which are changing the landscape of modern biological and medical research. These assays critically depend on bioinformatics and have led to quick growth of corresponding informatics methods development. Clinical-grade molecular signatures are proliferating at a rapid rate. However, a highly publicized incident at a prominent university showed that deficiencies in informatics methods can lead to catastrophic consequences for important scientific projects. Developing evidence-driven protocols and best practices is greatly needed given how serious are the implications for the quality of translational and basic science. Several exciting new methods have appeared over the past 18 months, that open new roads for progress in bioinformatics methods and their impact in biomedicine. At the same time, the range of open problems of great significance is extensive, ensuring the vitality of the field for many years to come.

Describe a new scenario in education and training known as \"Education 3.0\" that can help in the promotion of learning in health informatics in a collaborative way. Review of the current standards available for curricula and learning activities in in Biomedical and Health Informatics (BMHI) for a Web 3.0 scenario. A new scenario known as \"Education 3.0\" can provide open educational resources created and reused throughout different institutions and improved by means of an international collaborative knowledge powered by the use of E-learning. Currently there are standards that could be used in identifying and deliver content in education in BMHI in the semantic web era such as Resource Description Format (RDF), Web Ontology Language (OWL) and Sharable Content Object Reference Model (SCORM). In addition, there are other standards to support healthcare education and training. There are few experiences in the use of standards in e-learning in BMHI published in the literature. Web 3.0 can propose new approaches to building the BMHI workforce so there is a need to build tools as knowledge infrastructure to leverage it. The usefulness of standards in the content and competencies of training programs in BMHI needs more experience and research so as to promote the interoperability and sharing of resources in this growing discipline.

A directed review of recent literature. : We discuss the limitations and challenges of social media, ranging from social network sites (SNSs), computer games, mobile applications, to online videos. An overview of current users of social media (Generation Y), and potential users (such as low socioeconomic status and the chronically ill populations) is also presented. Future directions in social media research are also discussed. : We encourage the health informatics community to consider the socioeconomic class, age, culture, and literacy level of their populations, and select an appropriate medium and platform when designing social networked interventions for health. Little is known about the impact of second-hand experiences faciliated by social media, nor the quality and safety of social networks on health. Methodologies and theories from human computer interaction, human factors engineering and psychology may help guide the challenges in designing and evaluating social networked interventions for health.

A study was conducted by King Saud bin Abdulaziz University for Health Sciences in collaboration with Health on the Net (HON) Foundation to review the quality of Arabic health information on the internet. A review of health portals in other languages was performed. Meetings were conducted to investigate areas of collaboration with different stakeholders including: WHO, HON, the U.S. National Library of Medicine, and the NHS. The results of the assessment of Arabic health sites showed that a very small percentage (almost 4%) meets international standards. The study results call for immediate action to improve the trustworthiness of Arabic health information on the net. This will be achieved by establishing a reliable Arabic health encyclopedia and by encouraging health professionals from all Arab countries to contribute to its creation. It is important for the 300 million Arabic citizens around the world to be able to access valuable health information on the internet. More than 300 million Arab citizens around the world have missed the opportunity to use the internet to provide them with quality health information. Hence, to bridge this gap, a new project was launched to develop an online Arabic health encyclopedia. Moreover, this study proposes an Arabic health information foundation be established to govern and accredit the Arabic health websites, and to work in collaboration with HON, to regulate and promote the quality of health information on the internet in Arab countries.

A synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2011 is provided and an attempt to highlight the current trends in the field is sketched. This last decade, with the extension of the text-based web towards a semantic-structured web, NLP techniques have experienced a renewed interest in knowledge extraction. This trend is corroborated through the five papers selected for the KRM section of the Yearbook 2011. They all depict outstanding studies that exploit NLP technologies whenever possible in order to accurately extract meaningful information from various biomedical textual sources. Bringing semantic structure to the meaningful content of textual web pages affords the user with cooperative sharing and intelligent finding of electronic data. As exemplified by the best paper selection, more and more advanced biomedical applications aim at exploiting the meaningful richness of free-text documents in order to generate semantic metadata and recently to learn and populate domain ontologies. These later are becoming a key piece as they allow portraying the semantics of the Semantic Web content. Maintaining their consistency with documents and semantic annotations that refer to them is a crucial challenge of the Semantic Web for the coming years. ","399":"To define the key concepts which inform whether a system for collecting, aggregating and processing routine clinical data for research is fit for purpose. Literature review and shared experiential learning from research using routinely collected data. We excluded socio-cultural issues, and privacy and security issues as our focus was to explore linking clinical data. Six key concepts describe data: (1) DATA QUALITY: the core Overarching concept - Are these data fit for purpose? (2) Data provenance: defined as how data came to be; incorporating the concepts of lineage and pedigree. Mapping this process requires metadata. New variables derived during data analysis have their own provenance. (3) Data extraction errors and (4) Data processing errors, which are the responsibility of the investigator extracting the data but need quantifying. (5) Traceability: the capability to identify the origins of any data cell within the final analysis table essential for good governance, and almost impossible without a formal system of metadata; and (6) Curation: storing data and look-up tables in a way that allows future researchers to carry out further research or review earlier findings. There are common distinct steps in processing data; the quality of any metadata may be predictive of the quality of the process. Outputs based on routine data should include a review of the process from data origin to curation and publish information about their data provenance and processing method. ","400":"Health informatics is generally less committed to a scientific evidence-based approach than any other area of health science, which is an unsound position. Introducing the new Web 3.0 paradigms into health IT applications can unleash a further great potential, able to integrate and distribute data from multiple sources. The counter side is that it makes the user and the patient evermore dependent on the 'black box' of the system, and the re-use of the data remote from the author and initial context. Thus anticipatory consideration of uses, and proactive analysis of evidence of effects, are imperative, as only when a clinical technology can be proven to be trustworthy and safe should it be implemented widely - as is the case with other health technologies. To argue for promoting evidence-based health informatics as systems become more powerful and pro-active yet more dispersed and remote; and evaluation as the means of generating the necessary scientific evidence base. To present ongoing IMIA and EFMI initiatives in this field. Critical overview of recent developments in health informatics evaluation, alongside the precedents of other health technologies, summarising current initiatives and the new challenges presented by Health Informatics 3.0. Web 3.0 should be taken as an opportunity to move health informatics from being largely unaccountable to one of being an ethical and responsible science-based domain. Recent and planned activities of the EFMI and IMIA working groups have significantly progressed key initiatives.

From these issues, the authors propose cost-effective strategies that can fast track health informatics development in these low to medium income countries (LMICs). The authors conducted a review of literature and consulted key opinion leaders who have experience with health informatics implementations around the world. Despite geographic and cultural differences, many LMICs share similar challenges and opportunities in developing health informatics. Partnerships, standards, and inter-operability are well known components of successful informatics programs. Establishing partnerships can be comprised of formal inter-institutional collaborations on training and research, collaborative open source software development, and effective use of social networking. Lacking legacy systems, LMICs can discuss standards and inter-operability more openly and have greater potential for success. Lastly, since cellphones are pervasive in developing countries, they can be leveraged as access points for delivering and documenting health services in remote under-served areas. Mobile health or mHealth gives LMICs a unique opportunity to leapfrog through most issues that have plagued health informatics in developed countries. By employing this proposed roadmap, LMICs can now develop capacity for health informatics using appropriate and cost-effective technologies.

The paper summarizes FLOSS-related trends in health care as anticipated by members of the IMIA Open Source Working Group. Data were obtained through literature review and personal experience and observations of the authors in the last two decades. A status quo is given by a frequency analysis of the database of Medfloss.org, one of the world's largest platforms dedicated to FLOSS-HC. The authors discuss current problems in the field of health care and finally give a prospective roadmap, a projection of the potential influences of FLOSS in health care. FLOSS-HC already exists for more than 2 decades. Several projects have shown that FLOSS may produce highly competitive alternatives to proprietary solutions that are at least equivalent in usability and have a better total cost of ownership ratio. The Medfloss.org database currently lists 221 projects of diverse application types. FLOSS principles hold a great potential for addressing several of the most critical problems in health care IT. The authors argue that an ecosystem perspective is relevant and that FLOSS principles are best suited to create health IT systems that are able to evolve over time as medical knowledge, technologies, insights, workflows etc. continuously change. All these factors that inherently influence the development of health IT systems are changing at an ever growing pace. Traditional models of software engineering are not able to follow these changes and provide up-to-date systems for an acceptable cost\/value ratio. To allow FLOSS to positively influence Health IT in the future a \"FLOSS-friendly\" environment has to be provided. Policy makers should resolve uncertainties in the legal framework that disfavor FLOSS. Certification procedures should be specified in a way that they do not raise additional barriers for FLOSS.

Smart Home and Ambient Assisted Living (SHAAL) systems utilize advanced and ubiquitous technologies including sensors and other devices that are integrated in the residential infrastructure or wearable, to capture data describing activities of daily living and health related events. This paper highlights how data from SHAAL systems can lead to information and knowledge that ultimately improves clinical outcomes and quality of life for older adults as well as quality of health care services. We conducted a review of personal health record applications specifically for older adults and approaches to using information to improve elder care. We present a framework that showcases how data captured from SHAAL systems can be processed to provide meaningful information that becomes part of a personal health record. Synthesis and visualization of information resulting from SHAAL systems can lead to knowledge and support education, delivery of tailored interventions and if needed, transitions in care. Such actions can involve multiple stakeholders as part of shared decision making. SHAAL systems have the potential to support aging and improve quality of life and decision making for older adults and their families. The framework presented in this paper demonstrates how emphasis needs to be placed into extracting meaningful information from new innovative systems that will support decision making.

While the most salient challenge and obsessional target of the semantic web remains its ambition to simply interconnect all available information, it is interesting to observe the developments of complementary research fields such as information sciences and text analytics. The combined expression power and virtually unlimited data aggregation skills of Web 3.0 technologies make it a disruptive instrument to discover new biomedical knowledge. In parallel, such an unprecedented situation creates new threats for patients participating in large-scale genetic studies as Wjst demonstrate how various data set can be coupled to re-identify anonymous genetic information. The best paper selection of articles on decision support shows examples of excellent research on methods concerning original development of core semantic web techniques as well as transdisciplinary achievements as exemplified with literature-based analytics. This selected set of scientific investigations also demonstrates the needs for computerized applications to transform the biomedical data overflow into more operational clinical knowledge with potential threats for confidentiality directly associated with such advances.

This paper aims to show how five educators have used social media tools in medical and health education to attempt to add value to the education they provide. We conducted a review of the literature about the use of social media tools in medical and health education. Each of the authors reported on their use of social media in their educational projects and collaborated on a discussion of the advantages and disadvantages of this approach to delivering educational projects. We found little empirical evidence to support the use of social media tools in medical and health education. Social media are, however, a rapidly evolving range of tools, websites and online experiences and it is likely that the topic is too broad to draw definitive conclusions from any particular study. As practitioners in the use of social media, we have recognised how difficult it is to create evidence of effectiveness and have therefore presented only our anecdotal opinions based on our personal experiences of using social media in our educational projects. The authors feel confident in recommending that other educators use social media in their educational projects. Social media appear to have unique advantages over non-social educational tools. The learning experience appears to be enhanced by the ability of students to virtually build connections, make friends and find mentors. Creating a scientific analysis of why these connections enhance learning is difficult, but anecdotal and preliminary survey evidence appears to be positive and our experience reflects the hypothesis that learning is, at heart, a social activity.

Underlying technology to support Telehealth has been developed commercially. However, its widespread adoption has been hindered by numerous clinical, social, political, economic and management factors. This paper examines trends which may help to address this situation. First we consider the current status of Telehealth based on some state-of-the-art reviews. Then we present some new future modes of Telehealth services, as described by various prominent authors. From these we identify some common directional themes and fundamental issues affecting the success of future Telehealth innovations. This position paper advances a view that Telehealth in the future will be much more driven by widespread pressure from two different drivers: more ubiquitous connectivity and related technological capabilities due to greater diversity in human communication practices, and new models of care emerging from diverse widespread movements towards health services reform. The IMIA Working Group on Telehealth work agenda will address some specific items within the areas described above.

To grasp the potential of Web 3.0 we will need well-harmonised semantic resources that can richly connect virtual teams and link their strategies to real-time and tailored evidence. Facts, decision logic, care pathway steps, alerts, education need to be embedded within components that can interact with multiple EHR systems and services consistently. Using Health Informatics 3.0 a patient's current situation could be compared with the outcomes of very similar patients (from across millions) to deliver personalised care recommendations. The integration of EHRs with biomedical sciences ('omics) research results and predictive models such as the Virtual Physiological Human could help speed up the translation of new knowledge into clinical practice.

In Belgium, a Ministerial Decree in 2001 established criteria for the certification of Physician Specialist in Health Data Management. Such recognition of a new competence is a natural complement to a University Master's degree and can have a major influence on the salary scale and on professional recognition and development in public and private sectors. Teaching and training programmes in Belgium were adapted according to the Decree. Ninety-seven physicians were certified in the French community and 72 in the Flemish community between 2002 and 2009, with a prerequisite of this title for engagement in several official and private positions, and a salary increase. In other countries, recognition of a specific competence in health informatics remains, at best, a voluntary registration process and University programs vary widely. The implications of this Decree, with recognition of Physician Specialist in Health Data Management as a special competence, rather than a medical specialty, are discussed.

To assess the current situation regarding the opportunities for research and education in Medical Informatics in India and related issues like availability of career options. A survey questionnaire was sent by postal mail to well-known Indian institutions engaged in medical informatics training and research. In addition, key stakeholders working towards imparting education and awareness on the principles and practice of medical informatics were contacted to provide information about training and research in medical informatics in India. This was a purposive sampling based on prior knowledge. The responses were thematically analyzed. A total of six courses were identified in the survey. These were administered through face to face (F2F), e-learning and other modes of distance learning. In general, most of the students are graduates in medicine (allopathic, homeopathic, ayurvedic), allied sciences (nursing, physiotherapy) and medical administrators or graduates in engineering or library and information sciences. Most of them are also working, thus, the majority of the courses are for part-timers and act as on-job value addition. Most of the courses however do not directly train for jobs. Therefore, as most of the participants are already working somewhere, the question of placement due to the course may not be measurable directly. Since most of the students from India are already employed, by attending this course they gain further insights into health informatics that they want to pursue as a career. ","423":"Substantial global and national commitment will be required for current healthcare systems and health professional practices to become learning care systems utilizing information and communications technology (ICT) empowered by informatics. To engage this multifaceted challenge, a vision is required that shifts the emphasis from silos of activities toward integrated systems. Successful systems will include a set of essential elements, e.g., a sufficient ICT infrastructure, evolving health care processes based on evidence and harmonized to local cultures, a fresh view toward educational preparation, sound and sustained policy support, and ongoing applied research and development. Increasingly, leaders are aware that ICT empowered by informatics must be an integral part of their national and regional visions. This paper sketches out the elements of what is needed in terms of objectives and some steps toward achieving them. It summarizes some of the progress that has been made to date by the American and International Medical Informatics Associations working separately as well as collaborating to conceptualize informatics capacity building in order to bring this vision to reality in low resource nations in particular.","424":"To summarize major current developments and research in the field of mobile health (mHealth) services. Reports on the unique characteristics of mHealth platform and its role in delivering health services to the resource poor settings. Also, it evaluates different mHealth applications and identifies key success factors and challenges. mHealth, based on the most ubiquitous and widely accepted technology, offers an unprecedented opportunity to serve the unserved by right time medical information services. There is growing evidence that it has already transformed healthcare delivery in many resource poor settings through its low cost, high reach and versatile applications. However, challenges still remain with regard to the development of consumer centric solutions, and services quality in terms of knowledge and competence of the provider, integration of the information systems and interoperability of the information services. Additional problems arise from the collaboration, partnership and regulation perspectives. There are noticeable trends towards solutions for these problems. ","425":"The aim of this paper is to identify and report the issues facing human capacity development through the use of telemedicine in Sub-Saharan Africa. Data were obtained through literature review and personal observation. Sub-Saharan Africa has a great burden of disease and an extreme shortage of health workers. Its countries are poor and the majority of its population rural. Telemedicine for clinical practice and education of health workers is seen as a possible means of addressing some of the health problems of Africa. A number of factors have been identified that impede the use of telemedicine in sub-Saharan Africa. These include, poverty, shortage of human resources, very limited existing infrastructure, lack of connectivity, high connectivity costs, lack of capacity development and policy issues. Examples of successful use of telemedicine and tele-educational programmes in Africa to develop capacity in health are given. Initiatives to develop capacity through tele-education appear to have been well received and are more successful than clinical telemedicine. There is need to raise awareness of telemedicine if it is to assist in developing ehealth capacity in Africa. ","426":"To summarize current excellent research in the field of bioinformatics. Synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2010. The selection process for this yearbook's section on Bioinformatics results in five excellent articles highlighting the progress made in advancing the understanding of genotype-phenotype relationship, and their concrete application in clinical settings. First, next generation sequencing techniques have allowed the discovery of an ever larger number of genetic variations at a greater resolution, and methods were developed to ensure accurate data analysis. Second, innovative approaches were applied to gene expression data to allow its link to a wider phenotypic spectrum and to enhance its use for disease understanding. Third, there is a notable trend in visualizing diseases as network rather than individual entities, and this has provided new insights for disease interpretation. The progress mentioned above is further aided by continual development in bio-ontologies which provide means for semantic, and thus phenotype, comparison. The current literature showed a tightening link between genotype and phenotype, placing us one step closer to a better disease classification, patient stratification as well as the development of personalized medicine. ","427":"Tissue microarray (TMA) techniques are among the most promising developments in biomedicine during the last decade. Bioinformatics techniques are indispensable for storing and processing the masses of data related with tissue archive administration and investigation of raw data. Interrelationship between experimental and computational work will be shown. Tissue specimen arrays allow parallel analysis of huge amounts of samples. TMA techniques thus produce enormous masses of raw data, and optimal use of data can only be made using modern bioinformatics techniques based on huge storage systems, scalable multilayer software architecture and high-throughput algorithms for retrieval and statistical processing. Further crucial issues addressed by informatics techniques are specimen identification during the whole processing chain, and anonymization whenever scientific work is performed without regard to a certain patient. TMA supported by bioinformatics methods has helped in identification of biomarkers, mainly in cancer diagnosis. Moreover, it provides powerful means of quality assurance and training in histopathology. Further statistical analyses seem to be necessary to detect if certain biomarkers are present in nearly all kinds of specimen of the concerned patient, which would allow effective mass screening based on easily accessible specimen. Some investigations showed low dependence on the specimen localization, whereas others suggest to be extremely careful in material selection for the recipient block.

Synopsis of the articles on education and consumer health informatics selected for the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2010. A growing number of individuals are actively seeking health information through a varying selection of resources. The Internet is now seen as a major source of health information alongside with books and other means of paper-based literature. However, it is not clear how the Internet is perceived by varied groups such as those coming from differing age groups. The papers selected attempt to obtain a better understanding about how the public perceives and uses the Internet as an information gathering tool-especially for health information. The papers also explore into how the Internet is used by different groups of people. As all online health information is not of uniform quality, it is important to access and rely on quality medical information. This issue is also dealt with, where the popularity of Wikipedia is measured with the popularity of reliable web sources such as Medline Plus and NHS Direct.

Four interesting papers, dealing with structured knowledge, have been selected for the section knowledge representation and management. Combining the newest techniques in computational linguistics and natural language processing with the latest methods in statistical data analysis, machine learning and text mining has proved to be efficient for turning unstructured textual information into meaningful knowledge. Three of the four selected papers for the section knowledge representation and management corroborate this approach and depict various experiments conducted to .extract meaningful knowledge from unstructured free texts such as extracting cancer disease characteristics from pathology reports, or extracting protein-protein interactions from biomedical papers, as well as extracting knowledge for the support of hypothesis generation in molecular biology from the Medline literature. Finally, the last paper addresses the level of formally representing and structuring information within clinical terminologies in order to render such information easily available and shareable among the health informatics community. Delivering common powerful tools able to automatically extract meaningful information from the huge amount of electronically unstructured free texts is an essential step towards promoting sharing and reusability across applications, domains, and institutions thus contributing to building capacities worldwide. ","431":"Can social computing efforts materially alter the distributed creation and maintenance of complex biomedical terminologies and ontologies; a review of distributed authoring history and status. Social computing projects, such as Wikipedia, have dramatically altered the perception and reality of large-scale content projects and the labor required to create and maintain them. Health terminologies have become large, complex, interdependent content artifacts of increasing importance to biomedical research and the communities understanding of biology, medicine, and optimal healthcare practices. The question naturally arises as to whether social computing models and distributed authoring platforms can be applied to the voluntary, distributed authoring of high-quality terminologies and ontologies. An historical review of distributed authoring developments. The trajectory of description logic-driven authoring tools, group process, and web-based platforms suggests that public distributed authoring is likely feasible and practical; however, no compelling example on the order of Wikipedia is yet extant. Nevertheless, several projects, including the Gene Ontology and the new revision of the International Classification of Disease (ICD-11) hold promise.

Thus, clearly, the importance of studies related to computerized prescription order entry (CPOE) systems and guidelines management systems for both medical decision making and care providers, occupies a central role in the field, with application affecting also EHR vendors. In parallel, we observe translational interests for developing bridges with results generated by molecular biology, where the mass of data generated by high\/throughput experiments and large-scale genome analysis projects, raises specific processing challenges. The best paper selection of articles on decision support shows examples of excellent research on methods concerning original development as well as quality assurance of previously reported studies.

Scientific and gray literature reviews complemented by expert interviews. Various domains of decision support are developed and deployed in Sub-Saharan Africa: public health information systems, clinical decision-support systems, and patient-centred decision-support systems. Until recently, most of these systems have been deployed by international organizations without a real ownership policy entrusted to the African stakeholders. Many of these endeavours have remained or ceased at the experimentation stage. The multiplicity of organizations has led to the deployment of fragmented systems causing serious interoperability problems. In addition to basic infrastructures, these studies also highlight the importance of good organization, training and support, as key to the success and sustainability of these decision support systems.

Recent articles on imaging informatics and related articles from PubMed were reviewed and analyzed. Some new developments and challenges that recent research in imaging informatics will meet are identified and discussed. While much literature continues to be devoted to traditional imaging informatics topics of image processing, visualization, and computerized detection, three new trends are emerging: (1) development of ontologies to describe radiology reports and images, (2) structured reporting and image annotation methods to make image semantics explicit and machine-accessible, and (3) applications that use semantic image information for decision support to improve radiologist interpretation performance. The informatics methods being developed have similarities and synergies with recent work in the biomedical informatics community that leverage large high-throughput data sets, and future research in imaging informatics will build on these advances to enable discovery by mining large image databases. Imaging informatics is beginning to develop and apply knowledge representation and analysis methods to image datasets. This type of work, already commonplace in biomedical research with large scale molecular and clinical datasets, will lead to new ways for computers to work with image data.

The field of health information systems development has been studied extensively. Despite this, failed implementations are still common. Theoretical frameworks for HIS development are available that can guide implementers. As awareness, acceptance, and demand for health information systems increase globally, the variety of approaches and strategies will also follow. For developing countries with scarce resources, a trial-and-error approach can be very costly. Lessons from the successes and failures of initial HIS implementations have been abstracted into theoretical frameworks. These frameworks organize complex HIS concepts into methodologies that standardize techniques in implementation. As globalization continues to impact healthcare in the developing world, demand for more responsive health systems will become urgent. More comprehensive frameworks and practical tools to guide HIS implementers will be imperative.

Over the last three years, decisions have been made and steps have been initiated which will lead to significant changes for IMIA. In addition to its continuing activities in being involved (1) in organizing conferences, with Medinfo 2010 as this year's highlight, (2) in publication, and (3) in working\/special interest group activities, new steps were (4) extending IMIA's conference portfolio, leading to a biennial Medinfo cycle from 2015 on, (5) launching the journal Applied Clinical Informatics as a bridge from informatics theory to applications, (6) endorsing and publishing White Papers, such as the revised IMIA recommendations on education, (7) strengthening ties with WHO, and (8) establishing the Middle East Association of Health Informatics (MEAHI) as an IMIA region in order to start formalising regional organization and health and biomedical informatics activities in the Middle East. Last, but not least, IMIA's internal organization is being adapted in order to better meet future demands.

","443":"To review the rapid evolution of imaging informatics dealing with issues of management and communication of digital images starting from the era of simple storage and transfer of images to today's world of interactive navigation in large sets of multidimensional data. This paper will review the initial concepts of Picture Archiving and Communication Systems (PACS) and the early developments and standardization efforts that lead to the deployment of large intra-institutional networks of image distribution allowing radiologists and physicians to access and review images digitally. With the deployment of PACS came along the need for advanced tools for image visualization and image analysis. Review of the history of PACS and Imaging Informatics clearly shows that the early developments were focused on the radiologist's requirements for diagnosis and image interpretation. These early developments lagged behind the rapid adoption of digital imaging in areas outside radiology. Only recently, imaging informatics shifted toward the development of new tools geared toward the needs of other users such as surgeons, referring physicians and care-providers, and even for the patients themselves. Also in the recent years, the development of multimedia and communication tools in the consumer market has influenced the design and strategic development of image management platforms inside and outside healthcare institutions. The focus of imaging informatics has clearly shifted in the last decade from basic infrastructure design to complete data and image navigation systems. While the challenge of storing and managing large volumes of imaging data have slowly vanished with the rapid development if information technology, the new challenge emerged from the new requirements of image manipulation and analysis in clinical practice.

Some of the lessons learned from adapting the course to meet local needs are described and discussed. Simply attempting to transpose a successful course from one country and culture to another is not a guarantee of success. Educational staff delivering such courses need to take account of local context and culture, be flexible and prepared to adapt to students' needs and circumstances, which may be beyond anyone's control.

The nine data mining steps proposed by Fayyad in 1996 [4] were used as the main themes of the review. MEDLINE was used as primary source and 84 papers were retained based on our inclusion criteria. Clinical data mining has three objectives: understanding the clinical data, assist healthcare professionals, and develop a data analysis methodology suitable for medical data. Classification is the most frequently used data mining function with a predominance of the implementation of Bayesian classifiers, neural networks, and SVMs (Support Vector Machines). A myriad of quantitative performance measures were proposed with a predominance of accuracy, sensitivity, specificity, and ROC curves. The latter are usually associated with qualitative evaluation. Clinical data mining respects its commitment to extracting new and previously unknown knowledge from clinical databases. More efforts are still needed to obtain a wider acceptance from the healthcare professionals and for generalization of the knowledge and reproducibility of its extraction process: better description of variables, systematic report of algorithm parameters including the method to obtain them, use of easy-to-understand models and comparisons of the efficiency of clinical data mining with traditional statistical analyses.

The selection process for this yearbook's section on Bioinformatics results in six excellent articles highlighting several important trends First, it can be noted that Semantic Web technology continues to play an important role in heterogeneous data integration. Novel applications also put more emphasis on its ability to make logical inferences leading to new insights and discoveries. Second, translational research, due to its complex nature, increasingly relies on collective intelligence made available through the adoption of community-defined protocols or software architectures for secure data annotation, sharing and analysis. Advances in systems biology, bio-ontologies and text-ming can also be noted. Current biomedical research gradually evolves towards an environment characterized by intensive collaboration and more sophisticated knowledge processing activities.

The entire corpus of publications indexed by the National Library of Medicine in the PubMed repository was reviewed for articles tagged as belonging to the discipline of bioinformatics by Medical Subject Heading or by term in the title or abstract of the article. Selected summary statistics of this corpus were then used to motivate additional exploration. Over ten thousand articles published in 2008 populated the bioinformatics corpus. Significantly, there were at least as many publications in genomics and genetics that used computational techniques but that were not identified as bioinformatics research. Genomics and proteomics continued to be the leading application domains of bioinformatics research but despite the proliferation of human studies, the genes most studied in the corpus were from yeast rather than the human organism. The growth in the genomic studies of human disease was accompanied by a growing critical literature regarding the methods, results and impact of these studies. Concurrently, the availability of full genome sequences at commodity prices has increased the computational challenges of human studies by several orders of magnitude. Further concerns were raised about the consequences of public disclosure of comprehensive or even aggregate genomic data. The impressive size of the bioinformatics bibliome is easily dwarfed by the challenges generated by the continued increased growth of high-throughput biological data sets. The demand for bioinformatics expertise and tools is therefore likely to continue to increase, at least in the near term.

We conducted an extensive Internet and literature search to establish the current status of nursing terminology education, research, and clinical use. We also surveyed 40 experts in nursing terminology from 15 countries to obtain more detailed information on nursing terminology education and clinical use. We found that there are gaps in nursing terminology education, research, and use, with the area of research being the most advanced. Nursing terminology is not taught widely in either informatics or nursing programs. Where it is taught, it constitutes only up to several hours of an informatics or nursing course. Research into nursing terminology has been very active, focusing mainly on the development and evaluation\/validation of nursing terminology, using reference terminology models, and mapping between these and nursing terminologies. However, little research has been carried out on the use of nursing terminologies in clinical information systems. In addition, there are very few systems in which a standardized nursing terminology has been implemented. In order to close the gaps in nursing terminology education, research, and clinical use, qualified personnel are required to educate potential users as to the importance of terminology-based information systems for semantic interoperability. In addition, more research is required into the implementation of nursing terminologies in information systems, and we must demonstrate the usefulness and effectiveness of nursing terminology-based information systems.

Four excellent papers have been selected for the section knowledge representation and management. All these papers are concerned with terminological systems whether it is to detect equivalent concept definitions, to structure narratives, to compare existing lay and professional terms or to reformulate the SNOMED's logical formalism towards a more expressive language. The ability of one computer system to access and use the resources of another system becomes crucial in a world where the amount of electronically stored data increases continuously. The selected papers for the section knowledge representation and management corroborate that interoperable medical terminologies play a growing and strategic role in Electronic Health Record (EHR) systems. Indeed, they allow data in clinical systems to be defined in a more uniform and granular manner, thus leading to flexible, semantically interoperable and trust-worthy health information systems.

We provide a synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2009, from which we attempt to derive a synthetic overview of the activity and new trends in the field. Five papers from international peer reviewed journals have been selected for the section on decision support. While the state of the research in the field of decision-support systems is illustrated by a set of fairly heterogeneous studies, it is possible to identify trends. Thus, issues related to guidelines processing implementation occupies a central role in today's field with two alternative directions: 1. broad medical applications, which attempts to assist decision-makers to process large patient sets; 2. narrow clinical applications focused on in-depth real-time signal processing for a specific population or medical specialty. The best paper selection of articles on decision-supports shows examples of excellent research on methods concerning original development as well as quality assurance of reported studies. It is also observed that this year's selection point directly to more original research areas such as temporal signal processing, although more traditionally related areas, such as information retrieval and\/or natural language processing, remain fairly active in the field. Altogether these papers support the idea that more elaborated computer tools, likely to combine together textual and highly structured data, including real-time data contents, are needed. ","457":"To review the recent research literature in clinical decision support systems (CDSS). A review of recent literature was undertaken, focussing on CDSS evaluation, consumers and public health, the impact of translational bioinformatics on CDSS design, and CDSS safety. In recent years, researchers have concentrated much less on the development of decision technologies, and have focussed more on the impact of CDSS in the clinical world. Recent work highlights that traditional process measures of CDSS effectiveness, such as document relevance are poor proxy measures for decision outcomes. Measuring the dynamics of decision making, for example via decision velocity, may produce a more accurate picture of effectiveness. Another trend is the broadening of user base for CDSS beyond front line clinicians. Consumers are now a major focus for biomedical informatics, as are public health officials, tasked with detecting and managing disease outbreaks at a health system, rather than individual patient level. Bioinformatics is also changing the nature of CDSS. Apart from personalisation of therapy recommendations, translational bioinformatics is creating new challenges in the interpretation of the meaning of genetic data. Finally, there is much recent interest in the safety and effectiveness of computerised physician order entry (CPOE) systems, given that prescribing and administration errors are a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. Of note, there is still much controversy surrounding the contention that poorly designed, implemented or used CDSS may actually lead to harm. CDSS research remains an active and evolving area of research, as CDSS penetrate more widely beyond their traditional domain into consumer decision support, and as decisions become more complex, for example by involving sequence level genetic data.

The best paper selection of articles on sensors, signal, and imaging informatics shows examples of excellent research on methods concerning theoretically sound original development in this field. Imaging and particularly multi-dimensional imaging has had in 2008 by far the largest number of publications compared to signals and sensors. ","459":"To provide an overview of the state-of-the-art of closed-loop systems in the field of mechanical ventilation. This survey is reviewing the literature and proposes an overview of existing closed-loop systems, in different areas of mechanical ventilation. It discusses the key points that guided their development and addresses specific issues such as their performance and penetration at the bedside. Much research has been undertaken in the hope of improving patient-ventilator interaction and shortening the weaning process. This led to the development of new modes of ventilation and expert weaning systems that are starting to achieve a wider clinical audience. Intensive care unit personnel are facing increasing work load during care for patients with severe, multi-system illness, using sophisticated equipment that generate high information flows requiring quick processing. Mechanical ventilation is a good example of a process that requires skillful and timely management of multiple parameters that could be delegated to closed-loop systems. Availability of commercial offerings, validated by randomized controlled trials in a well-defined set of clinical situations, is starting to fulfill the promise of intelligent systems skillfully assisting caregivers at the bedside.

The elected articles highlight the new shifts in health information management and challenges faced by hospitals regarding IT infrastructures. ","461":"To identify core challenges and first steps on the way to sustainable information systems in healthcare. Recent articles on healthcare information technology and related articles from Medical Informatics and Computer Science were reviewed and analyzed. Core challenges that couldn't be solved over the years are identified. The two core problem areas are process integration, meaning to effectively embed IT-systems into routine workflows, and systems integration, meaning to reduce the effort for interconnecting independently developed IT-components. Standards for systems integration have improved a lot, but their usefulness is limited where system evolution is needed. Sustainable Healthcare Information Systems should be based on system architectures that support system evolution and avoid costly system replacements every five to ten years. Some basic principles for the design of such systems are separation of concerns, loose coupling, deferred systems design, and service oriented architectures. ","462":"To summarize current excellent research in the field of bio-medical informatics human factors. We provide a synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA yearbook 2009, from which we attempt to derive a synthetic overview of the activity and new trends in the field. A special attention was made to pick papers also from non bio-medical informatics specialized journals and to perform a worldwide selection. while the state of the research in the field of human factors is illustrated by a set of fairly heterogeneous studies, it is possible to identify trends. Thus, clearly, the importance of issues related to healthcare information technologies (HIT) adoption, still occupies a central role in the field. Convincing the clinicians of the HIT potential gains is still a challenge. But the HIT community will also have to give birth to interdisciplinary research and clear methods to optimize implementations and subsequent achievement of managerial objectives. The best paper selection of articles on human factors shows examples of excellent research on methods concerning original options to once again assess the importance of HIT and take into account the healthcare personnel psychology when confronted to the adoption of new tools and processes. ","463":"Clinical information system (CIS) developers and implementers have begun to look to other scientific disciplines for new methods, tools, and techniques to help them better understand clinicians and their organizational structures, clinical work environments, capabilities of clinical information and communications technology, and the way these structures and processes interact. The goal of this article is to help CIS researchers, developers, implementers, and evaluators better understand the methods, tools, techniques, and literature of the field of human factors. We developed a framework that explains how six key human factors topics relate to the design, implementation, and evaluation of CISs. Using this framework we discuss the following six topics: 1) informatics and patient safety; 2) user interface design and evaluation; 3) workflow and task analysis; 4) clinical decision making and decision support; 5) distributed cognition; and 6) mental workload and situation awareness. Integrating the methods, tools, and lessons learned from each of these six areas of human factors research early in CIS design and incorporating them iteratively during development can improve user performance, user satisfaction, and integration into clinical workflow. Ultimately, this approach will improve clinical information systems and healthcare delivery. ","464":"To present some of last year's best papers in the field of health and clinical management. Synopsis of the best articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2009. The selected articles illustrate how IT is enlarging its role in heath care management. By getting closer to patients allowing them feeding systems with there health data, IT can improve patient health management directly at patients' home. With data being documented in increasingly more structured and standardized way, health information systems can better integrated and reuse that data and offer more decision support to physicians and other health professionals. Furthermore, as more data is available in electronic format in real-time, entire populations' health status can be monitored by public health authorities allowing for better public health management. Although the selected articles are only a few bricks in global health management, they are promising examples of how IT improves the integration and collaboration between all participants in health care and offers support at all levels. Tying all these separate bricks together will still require work, as well as developing all the remain bricks, but systems interoperability allowing for data sharing and health participants collaboration are continuously getting more real. ","465":"Increasing patient demand for convenient access to their own healthcare data has led to more personal use of the Electronic Health Record (EHR). With \"consumer empowerment\" being an important issue of EHR, we are seeing a more \"patient-centric\" approach of EHR from countries around the world. Researchers have reported on issues in EHR sharing including concerns on privacy and security, consumer empowerment, competition among providers, and content standards. This study attempts to analyze prior research and to synthesize comprehensive, empirically-based conceptual models of EHR for personal use. We use \"B2C(2B) \" to represent this new behavior of EHR sharing and exchange, with \"consumer\" in the center stage. Based on different information sharing mechanisms, we summarized the \"B2C(2B) \" behavior into three models, namely, the Inexpensive data media model, the Internet patient portal model and the Personal portable device model. Models each have their own strengths and weaknesses in their ways to share patient data and to address privacy and security concerns. Personal use of EHR under the B2C(2B) model does look promising based on our study. We started to observe a trend that governments around the world are embarking on related projects. With multiple stake-holders involved, we are only beginning to understand the complexity of such undertakings.

Based on reports in the literature and personal experience, major challenges were identified, the current ways of cooperation defined and their relation to each other analyzed. Four main challenges were identified for both sides involving: products and functionality, integration of IT-Systems with each other and with medical devices, usability, visions and strategic management. None of the four defined cooperation categories cover all aspects of the challenges, but cooperation in small, dedicated groups appeared to provide the most advantages. An increased participation of HCPs in standardization activities is crucial either directly or indirectly via professional or scientific organizations. Cooperation between provider management (hospitals, clinics or systems) and manufacturers of health IT products will be the key factor for success of the HCI while providing substantial benefits for providers. Both sides should invest heavily in such efforts. ","468":"Development of guidelines for publication of evaluation studies of Health Informatics applications. An initial list of issues to be addressed in reports on evaluation studies was drafted based on experiences as editors and reviewers and as authors of systematic reviews , taking into account guidelines for reporting of medical research. This list has been discussed in several rounds by an increasing number of experts in Health Informatics evaluation during conferences and by using e-mail. A set of STARE-HI principles to be addressed in papers describing evaluations of Health Informatics interventions is presented. These principles include formulation of title and abstract, of introduction (e.g. scientific background, study objectives), study context (e.g. organizational setting, system details), methods (e.g. study design, outcome measures), results (e.g. study findings, unexpected observations) and discussion and conclusion. A comprehensive list of principles relevant for properly describing Health Informatics evaluations has been developed. When manuscripts submitted to Health Informatics journals and general medical journals adhere to these aspects, readers will be better positioned to place the studies in a proper context and judge their validity and generalisability. STARE-HI may also be used for study planning and hence positively influence the quality of evaluation studies in Health Informatics. We believe that better publication of (both quantitative and qualitative) evaluation studies is an important step toward the vision of evidence-based Health Informatics. This study is based on experiences from editors, reviewers, authors of systematic reviews and readers of the scientific literature. The applicability of the principles has not been evaluated in real practice. Only when authors start to use these principles for reporting, shortcomings in the principles will emerge.

After more than a decade of intensive research and development around the world, miniaturized medical sensors are becoming commercially available, allowing increasingly rapid collection of large-scale medical data and its wireless transmission to health care centers. However, most sensor systems are not yet in routine use and still restricted to specialized sites, undergoing validation trials, mostly within research laboratories. Challenges to routine adoption of medical sensor systems often arise from a combination of lack of awareness of the technology among many medical practitioners, technological limitations of the device systems (artifacts and noise resulting from problems in garment fit or device implantation), and open issues of evaluation and validation for the very broad scope of conditions in home-care and ambient environments over which medical sensors need to operate for routine, reliable, practical use.

","478":"The purpose of this article is to show that curiosity is the driving force behind all scientific endeavors. The second purpose is to show that all science is constrained on its underlying assumptions. Three examples are used to illustrate the above theses: one from cosmology, the second from biomedical research, and the third from the formalization of human reasoning in a computer. The three examples are supported by quotes from Albert Einstein. Research in cosmology shows that the horizon of our knowledge is continuously expanding but that major scientific questions remain to be solved. The second example from biomedicine explains that the more we discover of the details of living phenomena, the more complex they appear to be. The example involving human reasoning makes clear that the brain is still largely unknown territory. Like Einstein, who said he held 'humble admiration of the illimitable superior spirit who reveals himself in the slight details we are able to perceive with our frail and feeble mind', I have a deep admiration for the Architect who reveals himself in the details that we are privileged to study in our research.

We examine the most current methods used to evaluate IT return on investment (ROI) in the general business and in the health care sector, drawing attention on methods traditionally used in macroeconomic studies that could reveal themselves disruptive for IT ROI impact evaluation in hospitals. Financial and accounting methods can provide interesting data on a specific IT project but are usually incomplete for revealing the global IT investment influence. Econometric methods tend to demonstrate the positive impact of health care IT (HIT) on hospital production and productivity. Hospitals having higher levels of IT investment tend to deliver a higher level of clinical quality and show improved hospital cost performances. Information technologies are so intermingled with people and processes that the identification of specific IT benefit remains questionable. Using macroeconomic tools could be the best way to analyze and compute IT ROI in health care. Econometric tools take into account all types investments (inputs) and all the returns (outputs) enabling the precise measurement of IT investments impact, breakeven points, and possible threshold levels, thus providing helpful intelligence to reach the higher levels of IT governance in hospitals.

In supply chains and retails, traceability usually covers aspects pertaining to logistics. The challenge is to keep trace of objects manufactured, to track their locations in a production and distribution processes. In food industry, traceability has received a lot of attention because of public health problems related to infectious diseases. For instance, in Europe, the challenge of traceability has been to build the tracking of meat, from the living animal to the shell. In the health sector, traceability has mostly been involved in patient safety around human products such as blood derivates contaminants or implanted devices and prosthesis such as mammary implants. There are growing interests involving traceability in health related to drug safety, including the problem of counterfeited drugs, and to privacy. Traceability is also increasingly seen as a mean to improve efficiency of the logistics of care and a way to better understand costs and usage of resources. This survey is reviewing the literature and proposes a discussion based on the real use and needs of traceability in a large teaching hospital. Traceability in healthcare is at the crossroads of numerous needs. It is therefore of particular complexity and raises many new challenges. Identification management and entity tracking, from serialization of consumers' good production in the supply chains, to the identification of actors, patients, care providers, locations and processes is a huge effort, tackling economical, political, ethical and technical challenges. New requirements are needed, not usually met in the supply chain, such as serialization and persistence in time. New problems arise, such as privacy and legal frameworks. There are growing needs to increase traceability for drug products, related to drug safety, counterfeited drugs, and to privacy. Technical problems around reliability, robustness and efficiency of carriers are still to be resolved. There is a lot at stakes.

Current research in the field of Bioinformatics shows that the emergent field of systems biology is starting to offer innovative solutions to clinically-relevant problems. The approach used can be top-down, where models are created based on hypotheses to describe previously unexplained phenomena and then tested against experimental or clinical evidence. It can also be bottom-up, where mathematical models are built by harnessing existing information about the components (e.g. protein entities, interaction networks) of a system in order to discern critical system-level mechanisms that can be relevant for clinical applications.

IMIA, the International Medical Informatics Association, has established a Web 2.0 Exploratory Taskforce to bring together interested individuals from within and outside IMIA to explore the nature and potential of Web 2.0 applications. The Taskforce aims to develop background materials and sample uses of Web 2.0 applications, so as to propose specific lines of action for the IMIA Board and General Assembly. This paper provides a brief overview of Web 2.0 and related concepts, and examples of general and health-specific Web 2.0 applications. Some examples of the issues, challenges and opportunities are introduced, to set the scene for a wider dialogue on if, how, and how best, IMIA, and the wider health and informatics communities, should use these new applications and approaches. This brief paper provides an introduction to, and overview of, the many issues involved in considering the application of Web 2.0 to health and informatics.

We provide a synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2008, from which we attempt to derive a synthetic overview of the activity and new trends in the field. while the state of the research in the field of human factors is illustrated by a set of fairly heterogeneous studies, it is possible to identify trends. Thus, clearly, the importance of issues related to medical order entry, which also founded human factors studies in medical informatics, still occupies a central role in the field. In parallel, we observe an emerging interest for human factors from the field of bioinformatics, where the mass of data generated by high\/throughput experiments and large-scale genome analysis projects, raises specific processing challenges. Such challenges will have to be addressed to achieve post-genomics era medicine. The best paper selection of articles on human factors shows examples of excellent research on methods concerning original development as well as quality assurance of previously reported studies. The crucial role of preserving interpersonal communication among healthcare staff in computerized working environments is complemented by more original scientific investigations, which demonstrate the needs for computerized applications to transform the biomedical data overflow into more operational clinical knowledge.

The Centre for Health Informatics (CHI) is Australia's largest academic research group in this emerging discipline. Our research is underpinned by a planning process, based on different future scenarios for the health system, which helps us identify longer-term problems needing a sustained research effort. A research competency matrix is used to ensure that the Centre has the requisite core capabilities in the research methods and tools needed to pursue our research program. The Centre's work is internationally recognized for its contributions in the development of intelligent search systems to support evidence-based healthcare, developing evaluation methodologies for ICT, and in understanding how communication shapes the safety and quality of health care delivery. Centre researchers also are working on safety models and standards for ICT in healthcare, mining complex gene micro array, medical literature and medical record data, building health system simulation methods to model the impact of health policy changes, and developing novel computational methods to automate the diagnosis of 3-D medical images. Any individual research group like CHI must necessarily focus on a few areas to allow it to develop sufficient research capacity to make novel and internationally significant contributions.

The second section describes a functional model of an HFE lifecycle adapted for healthcare work situations. The third section provides an overview of existing HF and usability methods for healthcare products and presents a selection of interesting results. The last section discusses the benefits and limitations of the HFE approach. Literature review based on Pubmed and conference proceedings in the field of Medical Informatics coupled with a review of other databases and conference proceedings in the field of Ergonomics focused on papers addressing healthcare work and system design. Usability studies performed on healthcare applications have uncovered unacceptable usability flaws that make the systems error prone, thus endangering the patient safety. Moreover, in many cases, the procurement and the implementation process simply forget about human factors: following only technological considerations, they issue potentially dangerous and always unpleasant work situations. But when properly applied to IT projects, the HFE approach proves efficient when seeking to improve patient safety, users' satisfaction and adoption of the products. We recommend that the HFE methodology should be applied to most informatics and systems development projects, and the usability of the products should be systematically checked before permitting their release and implementation. This requires the development of Centers specialized in Human Factors for Healthcare and Patient safety in each Country\/Region. ","518":"To summarize current excellent research in the field of bioinformatics. Synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2007. Current research in the field of bioinformatics is characterized by careful evaluation of methods and by improved integration of methods into clinical workflows. Ongoing research on genetic causes of diseases is performed on more and better sources of reference data (genome sets and respective annotations), but is still hampered by insufficient, lacking or biased patient data. The application area of bioinformatics has been broadened, leading to amendment or even replacement of traditional methods in fields like characterization of microorganisms. Researchers carry out thorough statistical analyses in order to ensure quality and methodological correctness of new methods based on bioinformatic approaches which are more and more competitive compared to well-established techniques. The best paper selection of articles on bioinformatics shows examples of excellent research on methods concerning original development as well as quality assurance of previously reported studies. The crucial role of reliable and comprehensive data sources is affirmed, while technical development draws attention to the increasing problem of comparability of data derived some years ago with weaker equipment and those that are of up-to-date quality. ","519":"Biomedical Informatics as a whole faces a difficult epistemological task, since there is no foundation to explain the complexities of modeling clinical medicine and the many relationships between genotype, phenotype, and environment. This paper discusses current efforts to investigate such relationships, intended to lead to better diagnostic and therapeutic procedures and the development of treatments that could make personalized medicine a reality. To achieve this goal there are a number of issues to overcome. Primary are the rapidly growing numbers of heterogeneous data sources which must be integrated to support personalized medicine. Solutions involving the use of domain driven information models of heterogeneous data sources are described in conjunction with controlled ontologies and terminologies. A number of such applications are discussed. Researchers have realized that many dimensions of biology and medicine aim to understand and model the informational mechanisms that support more precise clinical diagnostic, prognostic and therapeutic procedures. As long as data grows exponentially, novel Biomedical Informatics approaches and tools are needed to manage the data. Although researchers are typically able to manage this information within specific, usually narrow contexts of clinical investigation, novel approaches for both training and clinical usage must be developed. After some preliminary overoptimistic expectations, it seems clear now that genetics alone cannot transform medicine. In order to achieve this, heterogeneous clinical and genomic data source must be integrated in scientifically meaningful and productive systems. This will include hypothesis-driven scientific research systems along with well understood information systems to support such research. These in turn will enable the faster advancement of personalized medicine. ","520":"To summarize current excellent research in the field of education and consumer health informatics. Synopsis of the articles on education and consumer health informatics selected for the IMIA Yearbook of Medical Informatics 2007. The consumer health informatics papers selected reflect the growing importance of communication and information retrieval systems in health care both for patients and professionals. Sound exemplary studies point out both the benefit for patients as well as the economic advantages of such systems. On the education sector, an intelligent tutoring system for medical students based on natural language dialogue serves as an example for the advancement and refinement of methods. The selected articles demonstrate the potential of advanced communication and information systems in health care. The physician-patient relationship though must not be affected by the introduction of these systems in order to ensure acceptance by both patients and physicians. Therefore these tools should be used in addition to current processes, and not as a replacement. ","521":"To report on recent efforts in the field of consumer health informatics (CHI) and education.

In the Yearbook 2007 the best paper selection of the section Decision support, Knowledge management in Representation' shows, that the evaluation of the influence of decision support on medical behavior and outcome is as important as research on new reasoning technologies and methods. The best paper selection process shows on the one hand that there is still a deep gap between rather small decision support solutions successfully evaluated in clinical environments and more complex decision support systems using sophisticated reasoning techniques, but lack of clinical use. On the other hand the implementation of decision support systems today benefits from research done in the last decades. ","523":"Guideline-based clinical decision support is an emerging paradigm to help reduce error, lower cost, and improve quality in evidence-based medicine. The free and open source (FOS) approach is a promising alternative for delivering cost-effective information technology (IT) solutions in health care. In this paper, we survey the current FOS enabling technologies for patient-centric, guideline-based care, and discuss the current trends and future directions of their role in clinical decision support. We searched PubMed, major biomedical informatics websites, and the web in general for papers and links related to FOS health care IT systems. We also relied on our background and knowledge for specific subtopics. We focused on the functionalities of guideline modeling tools, and briefly examined the supporting technologies for terminology, data exchange and electronic health record (EHR) standards. To effectively support patient-centric, guideline-based care, the computerized guidelines and protocols need to be integrated with existing clinical information systems or EHRs. Technologies that enable such integration should be accessible, interoperable, and scalable. A plethora of FOS tools and techniques for supporting different knowledge management and quality assurance tasks involved are available. Many challenges, however, remain in their implementation. There are active and growing trends of deploying FOS enabling technologies for integrating clinical guidelines, protocols, and pathways into the main care processes. The continuing development and maturation of such technologies are likely to make increasingly significant contributions to patient-centric, guideline-based clinical decision support.

Open source is a driving force in computer science research and the development of information systems. It facilitates the sharing of information and ideas, enables evolutionary development and open collaborative testing of code, and broadens the adoption of interoperability standards. In health care, information systems have been developed largely ad hoc following proprietary specifications and customized design. However, the wide deployment of integrated services such as Electronic Health Records (EHRs) over regional health information networks (RHINs) relies on interoperability of the underlying information systems and medical devices. This reflection is built on the experiences of the PICNIC project that developed shared software infrastructure components in open source for RHINs and the OpenECG network that offers open source components to lower the implementation cost of interoperability standards such as SCP-ECG, in electrocardiography. Open source components implementing standards and a community providing feedback from real-world use are key enablers of health care information system interoperability. Investing in open source is investing in interoperability and a vital aspect of a long term strategy towards comprehensive health services and clinical research.

Our objective is to summarize current trends and major achievements in the field of EPR in the last year and to discuss their future prospects. Integrating health data from a variety of sources in a comprehensive EPR is a major prerequisite for e-health and e-research. Current research continues to elaborate architectures, technologies and security concepts. To achieve semantic interoperability standards are developed on different levels, including basic data types, messages, services, architectures, terminologies, ontologies, scope and presentation of EPR content. Standards development organisations have started to harmonize their work to arrive at a consensus standard for EPR systems. Integrating the health care enterprise as a whole will optimize efficient use of resources, logistics and scheduling. The past few years have seen a myriad of developments of EPR systems. However, it is still a long way, until EPR systems can flexibly fulfill all user requirements and an EHR will become broadly accepted. Semantic interoperability will be a key to successful EPR use, especially to avoid double data entries and to better integrate data recording within local workflows. The patient will become an empowered partner, not only by giving him access to his health data. All this will result in enormous quantities of data. Thus, time has come to determine how relevant data can be presented to the stakeholders adequately. ","528":"To summarize current excellent research in the field of health and clinical management.

Potential articles were identified through Medline and Internet searches and were selected for inclusion in this review by the authors. We review highlights from the literature in these areas over the past year, drawing attention to key points and opportunities for future work. Informatics may be a key tool for helping to improve patient care quality, safety, and efficiency. However, questions remain about how best to use existing technologies, deploy new ones, and to evaluate the effects. A great deal of research has been done on changing provider behavior, but most work to date has shown that process benefits are easier to achieve than outcomes benefits, especially for chronic diseases. Use of secondary data (data warehouses and disease registries) has enormous potential, though published research is scarce. It is now clear in most nations that one of the key tools for improving patient safety will be information technology--many more studies of different approaches are needed in this area. Finally, both personal health records and clinical data exchange appear to be potentially transformative developments, but much of the published research to date on these topics appears to be taking place in the U.S.--more research from other nations is needed.

To explore the role of information technologies in assisting health organizations become sustainable enterprises. A review of recent literature into sustainable systems and an analysis and extension of the literature to the specific case of healthcare. Many if not all health systems around the globe face dual challenges of increasing demands and diminishing resources, which are ultimately unsustainable. Four physical system conditions which are pre-requisites for sustainability of systems--that materials should not be extracted, accumulate or be depleted faster than they can be managed, and that systems should fundamentally meet human needs apply equally to healthcare. For healthcare, in addition to physical material and energy, resources include people, and data, information and knowledge. Further, healthcare is an open system that needs to be sufficiently adaptive to changes if it is to sustain. Information and communication technologies are crucial tools to enable any large and complex modern enterprise to model, measure and then manage business processes. Technologies like organisational simulation, the electronic health record, and decision support are essential tools for sustainable health services. Applied inappropriately however, IT can itself create unsustainable conditions, for example through the accumulation of legacy systems, a situation that adherence to technical standards should mitigate. It is crucial that our nations undertake a formal sustainability analysis of their health systems, to identify where the most pressing challenges are. In concert, there needs to be a long term process of exploring innovative designs for health services that improve the sustainability of the system as a whole, and there needs to be a will to implement the health system policies, infrastructure and services to ensure that in 20 years time we do have a healthy health system.

The IMIA Strategic Planning Framework stresses the following: (1) IMIA aims to improve biomedical research, clinical practice and public health (VISION); (2) IMIA aims to support investigation and development of advanced information systems and technologies (RESEARCH); (3) IMIA aims that its efforts are carried out in accordance with strict ethical and legal rules (BEHAVIORAL RESPONSIBILITY); (4) IMIA aims to promote education for and about biomedical informatics (EDUCATION); (5) IMIA aims to bridge relevant internal and external groups and organizations (RELATIONSHIP); (6) IMIA aims to incorporate multiple individuals, groups and organizations to constitute the IMIA Association. (REACH). IMIA plays a major global role in the application of information science and technology in the fields of healthcare and research in medical, health and bio informatics. This framework provides IMIA with an excellent opportunity to focus its plans to ensure the highest probability of success is possible. ","535":"To discuss trends in information technology (IT) for the future of healthcare. To report from the viewpoint of a global healthcare IT enterprise. Healthcare IT consists of far more than electronic storage of information and automation of existing manual processes. It is the linchpin in an effective care process. Systems are available today that coordinate the complex processes across healthcare enterprises - providing alerts and reminders that can help healthcare providers not only operate more effectively but protect patient safety. The next revolution in healthcare information technology - personalized, evidence-based medicine, with information technology at the hub - is on the horizon. Although the healthcare industry has lagged behind many other industries in the adoption of sophisticated IT systems, perhaps no other industry can benefit as much from its use. Medical informatics subject matter experts must continue to advocate and support IT adoption for both the effects of process improvement and cost containment and for its potential to impact care outcomes. ","536":"This paper presents the early history of the development of CPR in Sweden, the importance of international cooperation and standardisation and how this cooperation has been facilitated by IMIA, the European Union and the standards organisations. It ends with the lessons learned after 35 years of experience put together by the Swedish Institute for Health Services Development, SPRI, in a 5 year project initiated by the Swedish Government and with participation of most health care providers in the country. Starting with the first attempts to use punched cards to store and use patient information for clinical use the author describes his troublesome and difficult road to a Computerized Patient Record that could be used both for the work with the patient and as a tool to follow up both the diagnostic and therapeutic processes and for clinical research. The most important results of the efforts to develop a computerized patient record in Sweden are published in many reports, among them three SPRI reports published in the late 1990s, and they are: Standardized information architecture, a common terminology, rules for communication, security and safety, electronic addresses to all units and users and an agreed upon patient and user identification. The future CPR must be problem oriented, capable of only adding new information instead of repeating already-known data and be available in real time regardless of geographic location. It must be possible to present the information in the CPR as 'views' where the healthcare provider has stated in advance the information needed for his patients. There can be a number of 'views' for different occasions. ","537":"An overview of personal experiences in medical informatics based on Dr. Morris Collen's 50 years of research in the field. A personal reminiscence and historical overview, focusing on the first two decades of medical informatics, when Dr. Collen began working with Dr. Sidney Garfield, the founder of Kaiser Permanente, leading to his involvement in computer-based medical care, through the development of the pioneering Automated Multiphasic Health Testing (AMHT) system, which they introduced into Kaiser clinics in Oakland and San Francisco. Statistical models for medical decision-making based on consultations with Jerzy Neyman and George Dantzig were incorporated into the AMHT, and tested on a large database of cases. Meetings with other pioneers in medical informatics at the Karolinska Institute led to the formation of the early society Salutas Unitas, and the many national and international collaborations which followed during the first two decades helped coalesce the field as clinicians and researchers investigated problems of medical data, decision support, and laboratory, hospital, and library information systems. Dr. Collen's research and his many medical informatics activities significantly contributed to the growth of the field. The U.S. contributions are covered extensively in his book, A History of Medical Informatics in the United States, 1950-1990. Washington, DC: Am Med Informatics Association 1995. ","538":"In the paper we described the partial achievements reached by the EuroMISE Center in research and higher education, supporting better healthcare in future information society. Through the research cooperation, the EuroMISE Centre suggests publicly available tools and methods that allow the application of new technologies for various healthcare organizations and citizens, with a special focus on the national environment of the Czech Republic. It provides a platform for a greater level of research cooperation with the usage of the most up-to-date information and communication technologies and a wide spectrum of clinical and genetic data and knowledge. Results of research and higher education of the EuroMISE Centre in the field of Biomedical Informatics are described in outputs of national and European projects. Further results have been published and\/or presented at national and international meetings and incorporated in education and healthcare practice. The long-term effect of postgraduate doctoral education in the field of biomedical informatics consists in the rapid increase of scientists that are needed in the Czech Republic to reach the goals of information society in health care. The multidisciplinary research at the EuroMISE Center moves towards direct usage in the informational support of diagnostics and therapy, mining of the medical databases, and in the customization of healthcare based on the clinical and genetic profile of a patient. ","539":"There is an increasing need for well qualified health informatics practitioners and for educational programs that produce them. Since 1981, the School of Health Information Science at the University of Victoria has delivered a range of educational programs in health informatics. The School's objective has been to produce graduates who can assume a range of roles in health informatics, including managers, developers, researchers and evaluators of health care systems. The approach taken by the School has been to provide an integrated 'holistic' approach to health informatics education that balances both theory and practice. The curriculum has emphasized interdisciplinary skills and has been based on a process of consultation with key stakeholders in both industry and academia. In addition, several new distance collaborative models for health informatics education (including a distributed MSc degree program) have been recently initiated through the University of Victoria with collaborating Canadian universities. To date, graduates of the programs offered have become highly sought after, with the demand for graduates of the programs continually exceeding the number of graduates. The core undergraduate curriculum has recently been undergone refinement to include training in new emerging areas of health informatics. In addition, a distributed MSc program has been successfully initiated by the School, currently with 23 students participating from dispersed geographical locations across Canada. The School of Health Information Science at the University of Victoria has been involved in providing unique interdisciplinary education in health informatics for over twenty years. The School continues to maintain its emphasis on integrated education, refining its curriculum and moving into new areas such as distance education and cross-Canadian collaborations. ","540":"To provide a comprehensive overview of computer-interpretable guideline (CIG) systems aimed at non-experts. The overview includes the history of efforts to develop CIGs, features of and relationships among current major CIG systems, current status of standards developments pertinent to CIGs and identification of unsolved problems and needs for future research. Literature review based on PubMed, AMIA conference proceedings and key references from publications identified. Search terms included practice guidelines, decision support, controlled vocabulary and medical record systems. Papers were reviewed by both authors and summarized narratively. There is a consensus that guideline delivery systems must be integrated with electronic health records (EHRs) to be most effective. Several evolving CIG formalisms have in common, use of a task network model. There is currently no dominant CIG system. The major challenge in development of interoperable CIGs, is agreement on a standard controlled vocabulary. Such standards are under development, but not widely used, particularly in commercial EHR systems. The Virtual Medical Record (VMR) concept has been proposed as a standard that would serve as an intermediary between guideline vocabulary and that used in EHR implementation. CIG systems are in a state of evolution. Standards efforts promise to improve interoperability without compromising innovation. The VMR concept can assist guideline development even before clinical systems routinely adhere to standards. Frontiers for future work include using the principles learned by computer implementation of guidelines to improve the guideline development process and evaluation methods that isolate the effects of specific CIG features. ","541":"Information systems are expensive to create, and consume resources in their operation. They are justified in order to achieve clearly defined objectives in health service quality and efficiency. To ensure that these objectives are being met, and in order to build up an evidence-base to support well focused policies, systems, and practice, evaluation would seem to be fully justified and indeed essential. However, there are major factors jeopardising good evaluation practice, ranging from reluctance to commit resources or expose decisions to scrutiny, through to lack of appreciation of the full range of dimensions which should be studied. This paper seeks to create fuller appreciation of the issues and their importance. Experiential and literature reviews form the basis of an exposition of principles, methods, and key current activities. A summary has been produced of the key challenges to health ICT evaluation, and its adverse comparison with other sectors. An explanation of the viewpoints and levels of health information evaluation is followed by a short history of principal milestones, current scientific methodology activity, and key collaborative activities. The need for a stronger commitment to health ICT evaluation is demonstrated if the application of health informatics systems is to receive due recognition as scientifically and empirically justified. Commitment of resources and scientific endeavour are needed, and thus the recent Declaration of Innsbruck, arising out of an event sponsored by the European Science Foundation, is timely and fully justified. ","542":"This paper seeks to provide an overview of the initiatives that are proceeding internationally to develop standards for the exchange of electronic health record (EHR) information between EHR systems. The paper reviews the clinical and ethico-legal requirements and research background on the representation and communication of EHR data, which primarily originates from Europe through a series of EU funded Health Telematics projects over the past thirteen years. The major concepts that underpin the information models and knowledge models are summarised. These provide the requirements and the best evidential basis from which HER communications standards should be developed. The main focus of EHR communications standardisation is presently occurring at a European level, through the Committee for European Normalisation (CEN). The major constructs of the CEN 13606 model are outlined. Complementary activity is taking place in ISO and in HL7, and some of these efforts are also summarised. There is a strong prospect that a generic EHR interoperability standard can be agreed at a European (and hopefully international) level. Parts of the challenge of EHR interoperability cannot yet be standardised, because good solutions to the preservation of clinical meaning across heterogeneous systems remain to be explored. Further research and empirical projects are therefore also needed.

From the methodological literature, a number of themes for decisions are presented and related to the contemporary EHR situation. Special attention is paid to a number of important methodological themes. Definitive checklists for evaluation of EHR systems can not be recommended, but seven key steps are listed to guide the design of evaluation projects. It is concluded that the issues presented are not completely exhausted and the seven key steps might have to include iterative loops because of interdependencies between some of the steps. ","546":"To summarize current excellent research in the field of bioinformatics. Synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2006. Current research in the field of bioinformatics clearly shows ongoing unification of experimental findings and clinical outcomes. Microarray data, gene sequences and clinical data are more and more perceived as different but related facets of one entity. Significant work is done in the area of text and data mining in order to bring together patient data and biochemical phenomena by means of ontologies. A strong trend in the clinical field is performance of exhaustive studies on DNA material derived from patients that suffer from diseases that are already known to be inherited. Examination of appropriate methods covers data and text mining, ontologies as well as machine learning and classification. The best paper selection of articles on bioinformatics shows examples of excellent research on methods used for studying inherited diseases and their underlying genetic dispositions. Clinical studies, inclusion of experimental findings like microarray data, and of knowledge representation formats all lead to a better understanding the linkage between gene sequences, biological functions and clinical findings in the form of healthy state or physiological disorders. ","547":"To review the current state of the art in computational methods for the analysis of DNA microarray data. The review considers methods of microarray data collection, transformation and representation, comparisons and predictions of gene expression from the data, their mechanistic analysis, related systems biology, and the application of clustering techniques. Functional genomics approaches have greatly increased the rate at which data on biological systems is generated, leading to corresponding challenges in analyzing the data through advanced computational techniques. The paper compares and contrasts the application of computational clustering for discovery, comparison, and prediction of gene expression classes, together with their evaluation and relation to mechanistic analyses of biological systems. Methods for assaying gene expression levels by DNA microarray experiments produce considerably more data than other techniques, and require a wide variety of computational techniques for identifying patterns of expression that may be biologically significant. These will have to be verified and validated by comparison to results from other methods, integrated with other systems data, and provide the feedback for further experimentation for testing mechanistic or other biological hypotheses.

In the consumer informatics field current research focuses on meeting the informational needs of laypersons as well as health professionals with their specific demands and abilities. The selected papers' topics are genetic diseases and conditions, decision support for women considering genetic testing for the risk of breast cancer, history taking and advice for parents with children suffering from asthma, timed messages to motivate and support quit smoking efforts and the integration of health economics in medical education. The selected articles demonstrate examples of excellent research in consumer health informatics and medical education. The methods presented can contribute to the development of systems for the education of both laypersons and health professionals. ","549":"The two authors of this article share both a strong interest in, and deep concerns about, the use of eHealth (electronic information and communication technologies for improving or maintaining health). In this article, we identify some unanticipated obstacles to effective use of eHealth. We reflected upon the potential of information and communication technologies to transform the health system and its failure to achieve that potential. We chose seven obstacles: the insufficient emphasis on health in eHealth, the lack of time for reflection, the development of a fortress mentality, poor evaluation of efforts, lack of involvement of youth, inequity, and a parochial attitude that precludes economies of scale. Whenever possible, we provided examples of innovative initiatives that illustrate potential ways to meet our current challenges. We believe that the obstacles we describe in this article can be overcome. The impediments are not only technological, but also cognitive, financial and political. To succeed will require a major shift from our ethic of competition to one of generosity, commitment, and collaboration; enlightened, as opposed to narrow, self-interest.

Decision Support, Knowledge Representation and Management covers a broad spectrum of methods applied to a variety of medical problems and domains. Some particularly interesting and current topics were picked for the IMIA Yearbook 2006: the importance of ontologies for systematic system engineering of decision support systems, syndromic surveillance based on natural language processing, the evaluation of large semantic networks, and a comprehensive ontology for a randomised controlled trial database to support evidence-based practise. The best paper selection shows that methods for decision support, knowledge representation and management can decisively contribute to the solution of many different medical problems, but also that there is still a lot of exiting research to be done. ","551":"Clinical decision-support systems (CDSSs) are being recognized as important tools for improving quality of care. In this paper, we review the literature to find trends in CDSSs that were developed over the last few decades and give some indication of future directions in developing successful, usable clinical decision-support systems. We searched PubMed for papers that were published during the past five years with the words Decision Support Systems appearing in the title and used our own knowledge of the field for earlier work. The goals of developers of modern CDSSs are to develop systems that deliver needed information and could be integrated with the healthcare's organizational dynamics. Such CDSSs form part of knowledge-management activities that healthcare organizations employ in order to excel. During the past few decades, we have witnessed a gradual maturation of knowledge representation formalisms and the needed infrastructure for developing integrated CDSSs, including electronic health record systems (EHR), standard terminologies, and messaging standards for exchange of clinical data. The demand for CDSSs that are effective and that will evolve as circumstances change gave rise to methodologies that guide developers on the construction and evaluation of CDSSs. Although there exist many approaches for representing, managing and delivering clinical knowledge, the design and implementation of good and useful systems that will last and evolve are still active areas of research. The gradual maturation of EHR and infrastructure standards should make it possible for CDSSs implementers to make major contributions to the delivery of healthcare.

The articles present excellent research with a possibility of having high relevance for the future in patient care. ","553":"The number of articles published annually in the fields of biomedical signal and image acquisition and processing is increasing. Based on selected examples, this survey aims at comprehensively demonstrating the recent trends and developments. Four articles are selected for biomedical data acquisition covering topics such as dose saving in CT, C-arm X-ray imaging systems for volume imaging, and the replacement of dose-intensive CT-based diagnostic with harmonic ultrasound imaging. Regarding biomedical signal analysis (BSA), the four selected articles discuss the equivalence of different time-frequency approaches for signal analysis, an application to Cochlea implants, where time-frequency analysis is applied for controlling the replacement system, recent trends for fusion of different modalities, and the role of BSA as part of a brain machine interfaces. To cover the broad spectrum of publications in the field of biomedical image processing, six papers are focused. Important topics are content-based image retrieval in medical applications, automatic classification of tongue photographs from traditional Chinese medicine, brain perfusion analysis in single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT), model-based visualization of vascular trees, and virtual surgery, where enhanced visualization and haptic feedback techniques are combined with a sphere-filled model of the organ. The selected papers emphasize the five fields forming the chain of biomedical data processing: (1) data acquisition, (2) data reconstruction and pre-processing, (3) data handling, (4) data analysis, and (5) data visualization. Fields 1 and 2 form the sensor informatics, while fields 2 to 5 form signal or image informatics with respect to the nature of the data considered. Biomedical data acquisition and pre-processing, as well as data handling, analysis and visualization aims at providing reliable tools for decision support that improve the quality of health care.

We surveyed the medical informatics literature, spanning the years 2004-2005, focusing on publications on CPRs. The main trends revealed were: 1) the development of technologies to realize privacy and security goals or remote data entry and access to CPRs; 2) investigations into how to enhance the quality and reuse of CPR data; 3) the development and evaluation of decision support functions to be integrated with CPRs; 4) evaluations of the impact of CPRs on clinicians, patients, clinical work settings and patient outcomes; and 5) the further development and use of standards to move towards shared electronic health records (EHRs). The CPR is playing a growing part in medical informatics research and evaluation studies, but the goal of establishing a comprehensive lifelong EHR is still a long way off. In moving forward to EHRs, convergence of EHR standards seems required to realize true interoperability of health care applications. User acceptance of present-day CPRs (for all categories of users) and compatibility with work patterns has not been achieved yet, and can only be realized by giving these goals high priority. This will require substantial resources for in-depth work flow analysis, development and evaluation of CPRs. Besides this, the implementation of effective CPRs asks for health care organizations that are willing to invest in new developments and to contribute to evaluation studies, to further improve CPRs' functionalities and enhance their use in practice. ","558":"To summarize current excellent research in the field of health and clinical management. Synopsis of the articles selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2006. Current research in the field of health and clinical management analyses impact and patient outcome of both established and recently presented approaches. Usability and effects of extracting data from computerized medical records for preventive care and surveillance issues are a topic as well as strategies for detecting adverse events. The best paper selection in the field of health and clinical management shows examples of excellent research on assessment, strategies and concepts for computerized health information management approaches. The articles emphasize the necessity of carefully considering health information systems regarding their outcome and compatibility with clinical routine. A concerted management of knowledge about evaluated health information management approaches will advance this trend and should lead to a more evidence-based design of the underlying systems. ","559":"The use of clinical decision support systems (CDSS) can improve the overall safety and quality of health care delivery, but may also introduce machine-related errors. Recent concerns about the potential for CDSS to harm patients have generated much debate, but there is little research available to identify the nature of such errors, or quantify their frequency or clinical impact. A review of recent literature into electronic prescribing systems, as well as related literature in decision support. There seems to be some evidence for variation in the outcomes of using CDSS, most likely reflecting variations in clinical setting, culture, training and organizational process, independent of technical variables. There is also preliminary evidence that poorly implemented CDSS can lead to increased mortality in some settings. Studies in the US, UK and Australia have found commercial prescribing systems often fail to uniformly detect significant drug interactions, probably because of errors in their knowledge base. Electronic medication management systems may generate new types of error because of user-interface design, but also because of events in the workplace such as distraction affecting the actions of system users. Another potential source of CDSS influenced errors are automation biases, including errors of omission where individuals miss important data because the system does not prompt them to notice them, and errors of commission where individuals do what the decision aid tells to do, even when this contradicts their training and other available data. Errors of dismissal occur when relevant alerts are ignored. On-line decision support systems may also result in errors where clinicians come to an incorrect assessment of the evidence, possibly shaped in part by cognitive decision biases. The effectiveness of decision support systems, like all other health IT, cannot be assessed purely by evaluating the usability and performance of the software, but is the outcome of a complex set of cognitive and socio-technical interactions. A deeper understanding of these issues can result in the design of systems which are not just intrinsically 'safe' but which also result in safe outcomes in the hands of busy or poorly resourced clinicians.

Five excellent articles representing the research in four different nations were selected for the IMIA Yearbook 2006 from three international peer reviewed journals. The best paper selection for the Yearbook section 'Assessing Information Technologies for Health' presents papers evaluating the benefit and side-effects of information technology in various settings. They clearly indicate that benefit of IT in health care can be achieved when the systems are appropriately designed, implemented and operated. Besides the presented quantitative studies, also qualitative study designs are of value to find unintended effects of IT, or to better explain found effects.

","562":"The existence and survival of university institutes is increasingly dependent on assessments of research and education. In many countries also departments of biomedical informatics are assessed at regular intervals, often as part of the review of a Medical or Health Sciences Faculty, or a Research School. The article underlines the importance of periodic evaluation of research and education in biomedical informatics. Quality assessment, if done by an independent review committee of peers, is a suitable instrument to obtain insight into the quality and accountability of both education and research. Key instruments for the assessment of education and research are well-defined protocols that are used for self-assessment. These self-assessment reports form the inputs for the independent review committee. The outcomes of the assessments are directly related to the quality of research, which is visible in publications in peer-reviewed journals. Internal quality management tools contribute to a large extent to the improvement of the quality of education and research. External assessment 'review by peers' is increasingly used as the final step of an integral quality system for research and education. This is particularly important if the results of biomedical informatics R&amp;D are to be applied in clinical practice. A positive outcome of an assessment can only be expected from a long-term investment in the quality of research and researchers who publish their results in peer-reviewed journals.

To make this easier is one of the major advantages of electronic healthcare records (EHCR). The computer-based patient record could make major contributions to improving the healthcare system. This is the motivation to initiatives, projects and routine implementations of electronic patient records. The European Union and national initiatives have put major efforts into the support of this main field of medical information processing.","670":"Patient-centered information systems augment traditional approaches to health information management with specific functions designed to support patient participation in health care decision making and treatment activities. In addition to computer-based record systems and business management applications, patient-centered information systems must include functionality that support communication between clinician and patient, and that provide information and peer support in a timely fashion to the patient. Current progress in information systems demonstrates the existence and feasibility of consumer health informatics, patient access to computerized clinical records, and technical and organizational solutions to integrating computerized patient information systems. We are now proposing a model of patient-centered system that incorporates all those components, and provides a vision of the future.","671":"Since the first study of communication between patient and computer was performed at the University of Wisconsin in 1965, programs for patient-computer dialogue have been developed, implemented, and studied in numerous settings in the United States and abroad, and the results have been encouraging.

The research programs focus on databases and extend to optimization of the \"Visible Human Dataset-Milano Mirror Site\" services. Additional activities relate to standardization at both the Italian and European levels, and to cooperation with hospitals and manufacturers.","712":"In Europe, coordinated activities in healthcare informatics education started in the late 1980s with the establishment of European courses in health telematics. At the same time the European Commission foresaw the need for spreading the knowledge of Information Technology (IT) in the healthcare sector. Therefore the EC, since then, has supported the initiatives that aim to create awareness, stimulate diffusion, and educated and train the users (healthcare professionals) in the application of IT in health care [I]. Initiatives, such as the NIGHTINGALE project, are essential for the planning and implementation of strategies for training the nursing profession in using and applying healthcare information systems. Other projects are the IT EDUCTRA project, which is a practical project in the field of education and training of healthcare professionals in information technologies, and the ERASMUS Master's Course, which aims at giving those working (or intending to work) in the health service and related activities, a broad, advanced postgraduate education in health informatics.","713":"The Medical Informatics Program at the National University of Singapore was established in September 1996 with a $4 million joint funding from the National Science and Technology Board and the Ministry of Education. The primary aims of the research program are to undertake upstream basic research in medical informatics and to build a critical mass of medical informatics expertise to meet long-term research goals and to effect technology transfer to the health sector of Singapore. Research projects fall into five groups: Clinical Decision Systems, Health Information Systems, Biomedical Datamining Systems, Medical Education Systems and Medical Networking, Applications Development and Integration Systems.","714":"Health informatics education is relatively new in Australia. It began at Central Queensland University in the early 1990s with the development of postgraduate programs in health administration and information systems.

The B.Sc. in Medical Informatics was conceived in 1992 and its first cohort of students, taking the three year version, graduated in 1996; those students taking the four year version of the undergraduate degree will graduate in July 1997. The paper describes our somewhat turbulent experience of the first four years, highlighting both the difficulties and successes of launching an inter-disciplinary degree. First, the story of the programme's development is given by way of an introduction and to establish a suitable context for describing the programme in more detail. Then, after presenting the aim and objectives of the programme, we describe the overall structure of the course, and reflect upon certain key issues for establishing Medical Informatics as a distinct, academic discipline.","728":"Health-care is a collaborative endeavor involving a number of individuals and organizations with diverse perspectives. Computer-supported collaboration technologies have great potential to enable health-care providers to improve the quality of care provided to their patients. Such technologies have the potential to overcome barriers to quality health-care in the small, scattered populations of rural areas. Rapid changes in technology are making it more and more possible for collaborative telemedicine to be a part of the practice of medicine. The World Wide Web has amply demonstrated that the globe has shrunk and information from afar is a mere mouse click away. However, the ease with which information is accessed along with the potential disclosure and misuse of personal information has raised serious concerns about the ability to restrict such information to legitimate accesses by duly authorized health-care providers. The authors present their experience in developing a health-care collaboration facility, ARTEMIS, which enabled Web-based access to electronic medical records, and provide a vision of their experiment to provide secure telemedicine for rural health-care practitioners.","729":"","730":"The design of the electronic medical record is becoming increasingly sophisticated as techniques develop to improve the understanding of user requirements. Such techniques must develop as it becomes increasingly important to improve the use and uptake of such records. An outstanding question is whether the same electronic medical record can fulfil the requirements of users in different clinical disciplines. To evaluate such a requirement it is necessary to understand the different information management the needs of different clinical disciplines. Only once these differing needs are understood, will it become possible to consider whether a common record is feasible in terms of both data modelling and the user interface. This paper describes the move towards a better understanding of user requirements. It outlines the differences between the requirements of various disciplines and discusses the implications. It concentrates on the differences between the requirements for hospital specialists and family medicine as an example of the problems.","731":"","732":"","733":"","734":"","735":"","736":"","737":"","738":"","739":"","740":"","741":"The University of Victoria has the only program in Canada offering a Bachelor of Science degree in Health Information Science. To meet the requirements of the degree, students must complete 60 units of course work (normally 40 courses) and 4 CO-OP work terms over 4.3 years. The School admits approximately 30 students each year. Seventy-five percent of the students come from British Columbia, ranging in age from 18 to 50 years with the average age being 26 years. In addition to recent high school graduates, over 40% have previous degrees or diplomas, and 65% have over 5 years of work experience. The School's teaching team consists of 4 full-time faculty, 2 professional staff, 2 clerical staff, 7 adjunct faculty and a variable number of sessional teaching staff. The majority of the faculty have health backgrounds, totalling 150 person-years of health care experience. As of November 1995, the School had 168 graduates 75% of whom are employed in British Columbia, 17% in other parts of Canada and 8% outside the country. Sixty-five percent of the graduates work in government departments including community health agencies; 10% work in hospitals, 20% work for management consulting firms, software houses, or computer hardware firms, and 5% are otherwise employed. Almost 100% of the graduates are gainfully employed in professional positions in which their health information science degree is valued.

The paper outlines a number of areas in which such projects have been performed, describes the previous backgrounds and post-training career directions of the trainees, and discusses certain observations based on our experience with the program.","744":"Previous case reports in this series on Education and Training have looked at specialist courses for postgraduate students seeking an in-depth knowledge of informatics and a career in the field. By contrast, this review describes a project designed to pilot a series of learning opportunities for undergraduate medical students. Although some UK medical colleges have opted to introduce informatics into the curriculum as a discipline in its own right, the Informatics Department at St Bartholomew's Hospital Medical College chose a different approach. When a new curriculum was introduced at St Bartholomew's and at The London Hospital Medical College, the Head of the Informatics Department saw this as an ideal opportunity to explore ways of integrating informatics into the curriculum. The initiatives described in this paper were made possible as a result of an award from the UK government Department of Employment. Money from an Enterprise in Higher Education grant funded a range of programmes, one of which was designed to introduce students to selected aspects of informatics and to demonstrate what is feasible in the undergraduate curriculum. The work carried out over a period of three and a half years was intended to provide the basis for the next phase of curriculum development. However, in the wake of the restructuring which has taken place in London medical colleges, the Informatics Department at what was St Bartholomew's has relocated to University College London Medical School, and is now called The Centre for Health Informatics and Multiprofessional Education (CHIME). University College is designing a new medical curriculum and CHIME is drawing on the experience gained through the Enterprise Project to find the best way to integrate informatics into this curriculum.","745":"","746":"During the last decade, several projects aiming at integrated clinical workstations have been described and several prototypes have been demonstrated. In most of these projects, the clinical workstation accesses information and functionality provided by the present proprietary legacy systems of health-care institutions. We discuss trends in integrated clinical workstations from the viewpoints of software engineering and integration, considering that the clinical workstation itself basically consists of three layers: a presentation layer, a data integration layer, and a communication layer. The software engineering view on clinical workstations focuses on the development of basic building blocks from which clinical workstations, specific to a particular medical domain, can be composed. The integration view on clinical workstations addresses methods and techniques to deal with the, in general, intrinsically closed information systems in health-care institutions.","747":"Coordination of activities among information workers and services, tracking and managing activities, and intelligent distribution of information are essential to the efficient operation of any large enterprise. This is particularly important in the healthcare domain, where many different organizations must cooperate to provide patient care reliably in a dynamically changing environment. In this review paper we present a distributed system that supports cooperative problem solving, activity management, and intelligent delivery of information in dynamic and unreliable environments. The system consists of a network of task\/context managers (TCMs). Each TCM manages a group of related agents. It maintains up-to-date information on availability, operational status, and activities of participating agents, and it acts as a mediator between service requesters and service providers. In addition, the TCM acts as a representative for its agents with other TCMs, allowing different groups of agents to collaborate with one another. This paper describes the system architecture, its implementation and capabilities including matchmaking, plan monitoring, and failure recovery. Our system has been used in prehospital emergency patient information management applications.","748":"The difference between an invention and a discovery is discussed, before turning to the sources of medical images. Next, the ongoing integration of image modalities in clinical routine is reviewed, as well as improvements in diagnosis and therapy planning with the help of better images in inter-connected distributed systems. Current shortcomings of image processing, and the attempts to overcome these shortcomings are presented. Examples of image processing are given, together with a vision on future systems and procedures.","749":"A health-care workstation is the means by which a professional interacts with the information artifacts of health care. However, a major transformation is taking place in the software architecture of health-care systems that alters significantly the role of the workstation. Health-care systems are becoming more complex in response to the need to support \"extended enterprises\" across regions, and provide both horizontal and vertical integration capabilities. Component-based software methodologies are being introduced that match well the needs of these large systems and the component services they must integrate. In the component-based framework, a workstation functions less as a \"portal\" for information transactions carried out on distant host computers, and more as the \"orchestrator\" for tasks involved in assembling, organizing, presenting, and manipulating information. Applications residing on workstations access distributed software components that carry out encapsulated functions for the application. Component-integration methodologies include both formal and ad hoc approaches; the principal emerging technologies are the World Wide Web (WWW), CORBA, Java, OLE, and OpenDoc. An emerging strategy appears to be that of developing application integration environments that encompass and support all of these integration methodologies. Component-based approaches also facilitate standardization at the message level, as messages to classes of components can serve to focus such standardization.","750":"The increasing costs of health care and the economic reality has produced an interesting paradox for the health professional to perform more clinical work with fewer support personnel. Moreover, an explosion of the knowledge-base that underlies sound clinical care not only makes effective time management critical, but also knowledge management compelling. A multimedia workstation is an electronic assistant for the busy health professional that can help with administrative tasks and give access to clinical information and knowledge networks. The multimedia nature of processed information reflects an evolution of medical technologies that involve more and more complex objects such as video sequences or digitized signals. Analysis of the 445 Medline-indexed publications for the January 1991 to December 1994 period, that included the word \"workstation\" either in their title or in their abstract, helps in refining objectives and challenges both for health professionals and decision makers. From an engineering perspective, development of a workstation requires the integration into the same environments of tools to localize, access, manipulate and communicate the required information. The long-term goal is to establish an easy access in a collaborative working environment that gives the end-user the feeling of a single virtual health enterprise, driven by an integrated computer system when the information system relies on a set of heterogeneous and geographically distributed components. Consequences in terms of migration from traditional client\/server architectures to more client\/network architectures are considered.","751":"The role of a clinical workstation is examined as an integral part of a larger, clinical information delivery and acquisition system. Different care scenarios and environmental factors influence the behavior of a workstation. The common functional components of a workstation are information resources, application logic and presentation. A workstation is successful when each of its components operates within an information architecture and contributes to meet user needs. New technologies to integrate and display information are making the workstation functions independent of the actual hardware and software platform.","752":"","753":"","754":"","755":"","756":"","757":"","758":"","759":"","760":"","761":"The Department of Medical Informatics at Columbia University College of Physicians and Surgeons consists of a faculty of 17 full- and part-time faculty.

The main goal of health care is to improve the health status of the population. To reach this goal the appropriate use of available information, including for example biomedical knowledge, epidemiological data or patient data, is necessary. The need for education in this field of medical informatics, statistics, and epidemiology is a requirement to solve health-care problems, to develop a long-term perspective and successful functioning of health-care systems. The information sciences can play an important role in promoting the construction of basic data, vocabularies and decision procedures, as well as developing formal methods for problem solving.","763":"","764":"Most medical schools in France have chairs in Biostatistics and Medical Informatics to coordinate the teaching of these two disciplines both within the regular curriculum of the medical studies and as a specialized teaching. This paper describes the current medical informatics specialized program offered at the Paris Universities. Since 1968 the program has comprised a Master of Science and a Ph.D. degree. At the Master Level, despite several reforms and in-depth program revisions, the curriculum is still organized as a set of modules of 100 hours teaching with a large freedom for the medical faculties to define the contents of the courses and for the students to organize their studies and combine medical informatics, biomathematics and biostatistics training. Since 1990, an intensive one-year full-time course is offered, called Advanced Study Diploma in Medical Informatics, which is strongly research oriented. This program seems a good strategy to form medical informatics specialists who have initially received a broader education in informatics and statistics.","765":"Stanford University School of Medicine has offered graduate degrees in medical informatics since 1982.

Together the limited and costly growth capabilities of such a system with its extreme difficulty in cooperating jointly with other heterogeneous medical systems, with the need for faster networking expansions, led to the new design of a distributed architecture called DIOGENE 2. In 1989, a migration process between DIOGENE 1 and DIOGENE 2 was initiated and is now on the verge of being achieved. During the time of this new expansion of the HIS, it has been easy to cooperate with the decentralisation process of the new hospital organisation as well as facilitating the integration of new functionalities like i.e. new WIS architecture, medical office patient histories, integration based upon PCs with UNIX based client\/server platforms. That approach combines the handling of paragraphs structured patient records with the use of medical natural language processing and semi-automatic encoding as well. Amongst these new functionalities the PACS are associated with image manipulation platforms called OSIRIS for X-Ray images as well as other tools devoted to molecular biology and genetics up to the ExPASy server on Internet using WWW \/ Mosaic which is accessible from all over the world. The distributed architecture appears well suited not only for the integration of these new functionalities but to keep them growing as smoothly as possible.","768":"Computer-based patient data which are represented in a coded form have a variety of uses, including direct patient care, statistical reporting, automated decision support, and clinical research. No standard exists which supports all of these functions. Abstracting coding systems, such as ICD, CPT, DRGs and MeSH fail to provide adequate detail, forcing application developers to create their own coding schemes for systems. Some of these schemes have been put forward as possible standards, but they have not been widely accepted. This paper reviews existing schemes used for abstracting, electronic record systems, and comprehensive coding. It also discusses the remaining impediments to acceptance of standards and the current efforts to overcome them, including SNOMED, the Gabrieli Medical Nomenclature, the Read Clinical Codes, GALEN, and the Unified Medical Language System (UMLS).","769":"With the growing complexity of health care, patient data are more and more in demand for purposes such as research, education, postmarketing surveillance, quality assessment, and outcome analysis. Many of these purposes require patient data to be available in a structured, electronic format. Despite the rapid advances in computer technology, which allow patient data to be organized, analyzed, and shared, the majority of physicians still use paper medical records. Apparently, most physicians still perceive the paper record as being more suitable for their task than present day computerized versions. Both the shortcomings and the strengths of paper medical records have been identified and it proves difficult to design a computerized medical record that exploits the strengths of computers without loosing the advantages of the paper chart. The structure of patient data is an area of high interest, since structure determines how physicians, other health care workers, and patients may benefit from these data. An overview of research efforts in structuring patient data will offer insight in the problems that still impede a widespread use of the computerized patient record in clinical practice.","770":"","771":"","772":"","773":"","774":"","775":"","776":"","777":"","778":"","779":"","780":"","781":"","782":"The graduate student program in medical informatics at the University of Utah described in this paper comprises a Master of Science degree (since 1976) and a Ph.D. degree (since 1962).

Most HIS systems commercially available today are based on designs and philosophies of the 1970s. Even though new technology has improved these systems' performance, to meet current demands, concepts must be shifted from the paper-driven system to an electronic system in which the patient is the focus. We need a merger of the functionality of existing systems along with new functionalities and a computer-based patient record. These new health care information system must have no boundaries; data collection must permeate all locations at which a patient receives care, and seamless linkages must connect all individuals who contribute to that patient's care. Even though systems are being designed today to meet these expanded informational requirements, we will not see such systems in use before the next century.","786":"Nursing informatics is a combination of computer science, information science and nursing science designed to support the practice and delivery of patient care.

Challenging problems of image segmentation, registration, and multimodal image fusion are still with us. Building dynamic, flexible electronic atlases will have a profound effect on the understanding of structure and function from the level of cellular physiology to gross anatomy, but requires the development of new techniques of visual knowledge representation and more standardized ways of defining the conceptual and linguistic constructs of visual objects in biomedicine, for linkage to medical records, research results, and educational materials.
