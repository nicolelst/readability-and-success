most countries, genetically modified microorganisms are not approved for use for fermentation in the food industry. Therefore, random mutagenesis and subsequent screening are performed to improve the productivities of valuable metabolites and enzymes as well as other specific functions in an industrial microbial strain. In addition, targeted gene knockout is performed by genetic recombination using its enzyme genes as selectable markers to maintain self-cloning status. However, random mutagenesis has a drawback as it does not guarantee improvement of the targeted function. Conversely, self-cloning is rarely used to breed an industrial microbial strain. This is probably because a self-cloning strain is similar to a genetically modified strain, as both undergo homologous recombination, although exogenous genes are not introduced. In this article, I discuss the usefulness of genome editing technology as a substitute for conventional techniques to breed filamentous fungal strains. This article particularly focusses on \"genome co-editing,\" a genome editing technology used for knocking out two genes concomitantly, as reported in Magnaporthe grisea and Aspergillus oryzae. Especially, when genome co-editing is applied to a target gene and a membrane transporter gene that aid the entry of toxic compounds into cells, the resulting clone can be categorized as an autotrophic and non-genetically modified clone. Such a clone should easily apply to industrial fermentation without being restricted by a genetically modified status. Genome co-editing will also be used to construct mutant strains with multiple target gene knockouts by eliminating multiple membrane transporter genes. This could substantially improve the productivities of valuable metabolites and enzymes in a stepwise manner. Thus, genome co-editing is considered a potentially powerful method to knock out single or multiple target genes that can contribute to the breeding of filamentous fungal strains in the food industry.","1":null,"2":"Given the increasing eutrophication of water bodies in Africa due to increasing anthropogenic pressures, data are needed to better understand the responses of phytoplankton communities to these changes in tropical lakes. These ecosystems are used by local human populations for multiple purposes, including fish and drinking water production, potentially exposing these populations to health threats if, for example, an increase in toxic cyanobacterial blooms is associated with increasing eutrophication. To test the short-term response of the phytoplankton community to the addition of nutrients (phosphorus and nitrogen, alone or in combination) and Nile tilapia, we developed an in situ mesocosm experiment in a freshwater lagoon located near Abidjan (Ivory Coast). We found that phytoplankton growth (estimated by chlorophyll-a quantification) was highly stimulated when both nitrogen and phosphorus were added, while there was no clear evidence for such colimitation by these two nutrients when considering their concentrations in the lagoon. Phytoplankton growth was accompanied by significant changes in the diversity and composition of this community and did not lead to an increase in the proportions of cyanobacteria. However, the addition of fish to some mesocosms resulted in a drastic decrease in phytoplankton biomass and a dominance of chlorophytes in this community. Finally, these experiments showed that the addition of nitrogen, alone or combined with phosphorus, stimulated microcystin production by cyanobacteria. In addition, no evidence of microcystin accumulation in the fish was found. Taken together, these data allow us to discuss strategies for controlling cyanobacterial blooms in this tropical ecosystem.","3":"Due to the emerging rise of multi-drug resistant bacteria, the discovery of novel antibiotics is of high scientific interest. Through their high chemodiversity of bioactive secondary metabolites, cyanobacteria have proven to be promising microorganisms for the discovery of antibacterial compounds. These aspects make appropriate antibacterial screening approaches for cyanobacteria crucial. Up to date, screenings are mostly carried out using a phenotypic methodology, consisting of cyanobacterial cultivation, extraction, and inhibitory assays. However, the parameters of these methods highly vary within the literature. Therefore, the common choices of parameters and inhibitory assays are summarized in this review. Nevertheless, less frequently used method variants are highlighted, which lead to hits from antimicrobial compounds. In addition to the considerations of phenotypic methods, this study provides an overview of developments in the genome-based screening area, be it in vivo using PCR technique or in silico using the recent genome-mining method. Though, up to date, these techniques are not applied as much as phenotypic screening.","4":"Laccases belong to a family of multicopper enzymes able to oxidize a broad spectrum of organic compounds. Despite the well-known property of laccases to carry out bleaching and degradation of industrial dyes and polyphenolic compounds, their industrial use is often limited by the high cost, low efficiency, or instability of these enzymes. To look for new microorganisms which produce laccases that are potentially suitable for industrial applications, we have isolated several fungal strains from a cave in northern Spain. Their phenotypic analysis on agar plates supplemented with ABTS (2,2'-azino-bis(3-ethylbenzothiazoline-6-sulfonic acid)) disclosed two laccase-positive strains. Further genotyping revealed that they belonged to the Gliomastix murorum and Conidiobolus thromboides species. The secretion of G. murorum and C. thromboides laccase-like enzymes was then confirmed by zymography. Further identification of these polypeptides by mass-spectroscopy revealed the nature of the laccases and made it possible to predict their functional domains and other features. In addition, plate assays revealed that the laccases secreted by both G. murorum and C. thromboides were capable of degrading industrial dyes (Congo Red, Indigo, and Eriochrome Black T). Homology modeling and substrate docking predicted the putative structure of the currently uncrystallized G. murorum enzyme as well as its amino acid residues potentially involved in interactions with these dyes. In summary, new biochemical and structural insights into decolorization mediated by G. murorum laccase as well as identification of laccase-like oxidase in C. thromboides point to a promising future for these enzymes in biotechnology.","5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":null,"12":null,"13":"Denitrification plays a central role in the global nitrogen cycle, reducing and removing nitrogen from marine and terrestrial ecosystems. The flux of nitrogen species through this pathway has a widespread impact, affecting ecological carrying capacity, agriculture, and climate. Nitrite reductase (Nir) and nitric oxide reductase (NOR) are the two central enzymes in this pathway. Here we present a previously unreported Nir domain architecture in members of phylum Chloroflexi. Phylogenetic analyses of protein domains within Nir indicate that an ancestral horizontal transfer and fusion event produced this chimeric domain architecture. We also identify an expanded genomic diversity of a rarely reported NOR subtype, eNOR. Together, these results suggest a greater diversity of denitrification enzyme arrangements exist than have been previously reported.","14":"Ocean pollution is a worldwide environmental challenge that could be partially tackled through microbial applications. To shed light on the diversity and applications of the bacterial communities that inhabit the sediments trapped in artificial containers, we analyzed residues (polyethylene terephthalate [PET] bottles and aluminum cans) collected from the Mediterranean Sea by scanning electron microscopy and next generation sequencing. Moreover, we set a collection of culturable bacteria from the plastisphere that were screened for their ability to use PET as a carbon source. Our results reveal that Proteobacteria are the predominant phylum in all the samples and that Rhodobacteraceae, Woeseia, Actinomarinales, or Vibrio are also abundant in these residues. Moreover, we identified marine isolates with enhanced growth in the presence of PET: Aquimarina intermedia, Citricoccus spp., and Micrococcus spp. Our results suggest that the marine environment is a source of biotechnologically promising bacterial isolates that may use PET or PET additives as carbon sources.","15":null,"16":null,"17":null,"18":"Colistin is a last resort antibiotic for the treatment of carbapenemase producing Klebsiella pneumoniae. The disruption of the mgrB gene by insertion sequences (ISs) is a mechanism mediating colistin resistance. Plasmids encode mobilizable IS elements which integrate into the mgrB gene in K. pneumoniae causing gene inactivation and colistin resistance. The species prevalence of mgrB-gene disrupting insertion elements ISL3 (ISKpn25), IS5 (ISKpn26), ISKpn14, and IS903B present on plasmids were assessed. IS containing plasmids were also scanned for antimicrobial resistance genes, including carbapenem resistant genes. Plasmids encoding ISs are abundant in K. pneumoniae. IS903B was found in 28 unique Inc groups, while ISKpn25 was largely carried by IncFIB(pQil) plasmids. ISKpn26 and ISKpn14 were most often found associated with IncFII(pHN7A8) plasmids. Of the 34 unique countries which contained any of the IS elements, ISKpn25 was identified from 26. ISKpn26, ISKpn14, and IS903B ISs were identified from 89.3%, 44.9%, and 23.9% plasmid samples from China. Plasmids carrying ISKpn25, ISKpn14, and ISKpn26 IS have a 4.6-, 6.0-, and 6.6-fold higher carbapenemase gene count, respectively, relative to IS903B-carrying plasmids. IS903B bearing plasmids have a 20-, 5-, and 5-fold higher environmental source isolation count relative to ISKpn25, ISKpn14, and ISKpn26 bearing plasmids. ISKpn25 present on IncFIB(pQil) sourced from clinical settings is established across multiple countries, while ISKpn26, ISKpn14, and IS903B appear most often in China. Carbapenemase presence in tandem with IS elements may help promote an extensively drug resistant profile in K. pneumoniae limiting already narrow treatment options.","19":"It is well established that the gut microbiota plays an important role in host health and is perturbed by several factors including antibiotics. Antibiotic-induced changes in microbial composition can have a negative impact on host health including reduced microbial diversity, changes in functional attributes of the microbiota, formation, and selection of antibiotic-resistant strains making hosts more susceptible to infection with pathogens such as Clostridioides difficile. Antibiotic resistance is a global crisis and the increased use of antibiotics over time warrants investigation into its effects on microbiota and health. In this review, we discuss the adverse effects of antibiotics on the gut microbiota and thus host health, and suggest alternative approaches to antibiotic use.","20":null,"21":null,"22":null,"23":null,"24":null,"25":null,"26":"Identification, source tracking, and surveillance of food pathogens are crucial factors for the food-producing industry. Over the last decade, the techniques used for this have moved from conventional enrichment methods, through species-specific detection by PCR to sequencing-based methods, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) being the ultimate method. However, using WGS requires the right infrastructure, high computational power, and bioinformatics expertise. Therefore, there is a need for faster, more cost-effective, and more user-friendly methods. A newly developed method, ON-rep-seq, combines the classical rep-PCR method with nanopore sequencing, resulting in a highly discriminating set of sequences that can be used for species identification and also strain discrimination. This study is essentially a real industry case from a salmon processing plant. Twenty Listeria monocytogenes isolates were analyzed both by ON-rep-seq and WGS to identify and differentiate putative L. monocytogenes from a routine sampling of processing equipment and products, and finally, compare the strain-level discriminatory power of ON-rep-seq to different analyzing levels delivered from the WGS data. The analyses revealed that among the isolates tested there were three different strains. The isolates of the most frequently detected strain (n = 15) were all detected in the problematic area in the processing plant. The strain level discrimination done by ON-rep-seq was in full accordance with the interpretation of WGS data. Our findings also demonstrate that ON-rep-seq may serve as a primary screening method alternative to WGS for identification and strain-level differentiation for surveillance of potential pathogens in a food-producing environment.","27":null,"28":"In fungal pathogens, the transcription factor SrbA (a sterol regulatory element-binding protein, SREBP) and CBC (CCAAT binding complex) have been reported to regulate azole resistance by competitively binding the TR34 region (34 mer) in the promoter of the drug target gene, erg11A. However, current knowledge about how the SrbA and CBC coordinately mediate erg11A expression remains limited. In this study, we uncovered a novel relationship between HapB (a subunit of CBC) and SrbA in which deletion of hapB significantly prolongs the nuclear retention of SrbA by increasing its expression and cleavage under azole treatment conditions, thereby enhancing Erg11A expression for drug resistance. Furthermore, we verified that loss of HapB significantly induces the expression of the rhomboid protease RbdB, Dsc ubiquitin E3 ligase complex, and signal peptide peptidase SppA, which are required for the cleavage of SrbA, suggesting that HapB acts as a repressor for these genes which contribute to the activation of SrbA by proteolytic cleavage. Together, our study reveals that CBC functions not only to compete with SrbA for binding to erg11A promoter region but also to affect SrbA expression, cleavage, and translocation to nuclei for the function, which ultimately regulate Erg11A expression and azole resistance.","29":null,"30":"Efficient control of transcription is essential in all organisms. In bacteria, where DNA replication and transcription occur simultaneously, the replication machinery is at risk of colliding with highly abundant transcription complexes. This can be exacerbated by the fact that transcription complexes pause frequently. When pauses are long-lasting, the stalled complexes must be removed to prevent collisions with either another transcription complex or the replication machinery. HelD is a protein that represents a new class of ATP-dependent motor proteins distantly related to helicases. It was first identified in the model Gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis and is involved in removing and recycling stalled transcription complexes. To date, two classes of HelD have been identified: one in the low G+C and the other in the high G+C Gram-positive bacteria. In this work, we have undertaken the first comprehensive investigation of the phylogenetic diversity of HelD proteins. We show that genes in certain bacterial classes have been inherited by horizontal gene transfer, many organisms contain multiple expressed isoforms of HelD, some of which are associated with antibiotic resistance, and that there is a third class of HelD protein found in Gram-negative bacteria. In summary, HelD proteins represent an important new class of transcription factors associated with genome maintenance and antibiotic resistance that are conserved across the Eubacterial kingdom.","31":"Interspecific interactions within biofilms determine relative species abundance, growth dynamics, community resilience, and success or failure of invasion by an extraneous organism. However, deciphering interspecific interactions and assessing their contribution to biofilm properties and function remain a challenge. Here, we describe the constitution of a model biofilm composed of four bacterial species belonging to four different genera (Rhodocyclus sp., Pseudomonas fluorescens, Kocuria varians, and Bacillus cereus), derived from a biofilm isolated from an industrial milk pasteurization unit. We demonstrate that the growth dynamics and equilibrium composition of this biofilm are highly reproducible. Based on its equilibrium composition, we show that the establishment of this four-species biofilm is highly robust against initial, transient perturbations but less so towards continuous perturbations. By comparing biofilms formed from different numbers and combinations of the constituent species and by fitting a growth model to the experimental data, we reveal a network of dynamic, positive, and negative interactions that determine the final composition of the biofilm. Furthermore, we reveal that the molecular determinant of one negative interaction is the thiocillin I synthesized by the B. cereus strain, and demonstrate its importance for species distribution and its impact on robustness by mutational analysis of the biofilm ecosystem.","32":null,"33":"Listeria monocytogenes is a human pathogen.

In this review we summarize current data providing direct or indirect evidence that plants can serve as habitat for L. monocytogenes, enabling this human pathogen to survive and grow. The current knowledge of the mechanisms involved in the interaction of this bacterium with plants is addressed, and whether this foodborne pathogen elicits an immune response in plants is discussed.","34":null,"35":null,"36":"The bacterial communities of Caulerpa lentillifera were studied during an outbreak of an unknown disease in a sea grape farm from Vietnam. Clear differences between healthy and diseased cases were observed at the order, genus, and Operational Taxonomic Unit (OTU) level. A richer diversity was detected in the diseased thalli of C. lentillifera, as well as the dominance of the orders Flavobacteriales (phylum Bacteroidetes) and Phycisphaerales (Planctomycetes). Aquibacter, Winogradskyella, and other OTUs of the family Flavobacteriaceae were hypothesized as detrimental bacteria, this family comprises some well-known seaweed pathogens. Phycisphaera together with other Planctomycetes and Woeseia were probably saprophytes of C. lentillifera. The Rhodobacteraceae and Rhodovulum dominated the bacterial community composition of healthy C. lentillifera. The likely beneficial role of Bradyrhizobium, Paracoccus, and Brevundimonas strains on nutrient cycling and phytohormone production was discussed. The bleaching of diseased C. lentillifera might not only be associated with pathogens but also with an oxidative response. This study offers pioneering insights on the co-occurrence of C. lentillifera-attached bacteria, potential detrimental or beneficial microbes, and a baseline for understanding the C. lentillifera holobiont. Further applied and basic research is urgently needed on C. lentillifera microbiome, shotgun metagenomic, metatranscriptomic, and metabolomic studies as well as bioactivity assays are recommended.","37":"","38":"Daily use of cosmetics is known to affect the skin microbiome. This study aimed to determine the bacterial community structure and skin biophysical parameters following the daily application of a skincare product on the face. Twenty-five Korean women, who used the same skincare product for four weeks participated in the study. During this period, skin hydration, texture, sebum content, and pH were measured, and skin swab samples were collected on the cheeks. The microbiota was analyzed using the MiSeq system. Through these experiments, bacterial diversity in facial skin increased and the microbial community changed after four weeks of skincare product application. The relative abundance of Cutibacterium and Staphylococcus increased, significant changes in specific bacterial modules of the skin microbial network were observed, and skin hydration and texture improved. It was suggested that daily use of skincare products could affect the microbial structure of facial skin as well as the biophysical properties of the facial skin. These findings expand our understanding of the role of skincare products on the skin environment.","39":"Vibrio alginolyticus and Vibrio (Aliivibrio) fischeri are Gram-negative bacteria found globally in marine environments. During the past decade, studies have shown that certain Gram-negative bacteria, including Vibrio species (cholerae, parahaemolyticus, and vulnificus) are capable of using exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) to modify the phospholipids of their membrane. Moreover, exposure to exogenous PUFAs has been shown to affect certain phenotypes that are important factors of virulence. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether V. alginolyticus and V. fischeri are capable of responding to exogenous PUFAs by remodeling their membrane phospholipids and\/or altering behaviors associated with virulence. Thin-layer chromatography (TLC) analyses and ultra-performance liquid chromatography-electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (UPLC\/ESI-MS) confirmed incorporation of all PUFAs into membrane phosphatidylglycerol and phosphatidylethanolamine. Several growth phenotypes were identified when individual fatty acids were supplied in minimal media and as sole carbon sources. Interestingly, several PUFAs acids inhibited growth of V. fischeri. Significant alterations to membrane permeability were observed depending on fatty acid supplemented. Strikingly, arachidonic acid (20:4) reduced membrane permeability by approximately 35% in both V. alginolyticus and V. fischeri. Biofilm assays indicated that fatty acid influence was dependent on media composition and temperature. All fatty acids caused decreased swimming motility in V. alginolyticus, while only linoleic acid (18:2) significantly increased swimming motility in V. fischeri. In summary, exogenous fatty acids cause a variety of changes in V. alginolyticus and V. fischeri, thus adding these bacteria to a growing list of Gram-negatives that exhibit versatility in fatty acid utilization and highlighting the potential for environmental PUFAs to influence phenotypes associated with planktonic, beneficial, and pathogenic associations.","40":null,"41":null,"42":null,"43":null,"44":"Om45 is a major protein of the yeast's outer mitochondrial membrane under respiratory conditions. However, the cellular role of the protein has remained obscure. Previously, deletion mutant phenotypes have not been found, and clear amino acid sequence similarities that would allow inferring its functional role are not available. In this work, we describe synthetic petite mutants of GEM1 and UGO1 that depend on the presence of OM45 for respiratory growth, as well as the identification of several multicopy suppressors of the synthetic petite phenotypes. In the analysis of our mutants, we demonstrate that Om45p and Gem1p have a collaborative role in the maintenance of mitochondrial morphology, cristae structure, and mitochondrial DNA maintenance. A group of multicopy suppressors rescuing the synthetic lethal phenotypes of the mutants on non-fermentable carbon sources additionally supports this result. Our results imply that the synthetic petite phenotypes we observed are due to the disturbance of the inner mitochondrial membrane and point to this mitochondrial sub-compartment as the main target of action of Om45p, Ugo1p, and the yeast Miro GTPase Gem1p.","45":null,"46":"Cyanobacterial carbonate precipitation induced by cells and extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) enhances mortar durability.

The basal transcription factor machinery binds to the TATA box found around 28 nucleotides upstream of the transcription start site; however, some transcription units lack a clear TATA box and still have TBP\/TFB binding over them. This apparent absence of conserved sequences could be a consequence of sequence divergence associated with the upstream region, operon, and gene organization. Furthermore, earlier studies have found that a structural analysis gains more information compared with a simple sequence inspection. In this work, we evaluated and coded 3630 archaeal promoter sequences of three organisms, Haloferax volcanii, Thermococcus kodakarensis, and Sulfolobus solfataricus into DNA duplex stability, enthalpy, curvature, and bendability parameters. We also split our dataset into conserved TATA and degenerated TATA promoters to identify differences among these two classes of promoters. The structural analysis reveals variations in archaeal promoter architecture, that is, a distinctive signal is observed in the TFB, TBP, and TFE binding sites independently of these being TATA-conserved or TATA-degenerated. In addition, the promoter encountering method was validated with upstream regions of 13 other archaea, suggesting that there might be promoter sequences among them. Therefore, we suggest a novel method for locating promoters within the genome of archaea based on DNA energetic\/structural features.","50":"Microbially influenced corrosion (MIC) may contribute significantly to overall corrosion risks, especially in the gas and petroleum industries. In this study, we isolated four Prolixibacter strains, which belong to the phylum Bacteroidetes, and examined their nitrate respiration- and Fe0 -corroding activities, together with two previously isolated Prolixibacter strains. Four of the six Prolixibacter strains reduced nitrate under anaerobic conditions, while the other two strains did not. The anaerobic growth of the four nitrate-reducing strains was enhanced by nitrate, which was not observed in the two strains unable to reduce nitrate. When the nitrate-reducing strains were grown anaerobically in the presence of Fe0 or carbon steel, the corrosion of the materials was enhanced by more than 20-fold compared to that in aseptic controls. This enhancement was not observed in cultures of the strains unable to reduce nitrate. The oxidation of Fe0 in the anaerobic cultures of nitrate-reducing strains occurred concomitantly with the formation of nitrite. Since nitrite chemically oxidized Fe0 under anaerobic and aseptic conditions, the corrosion of Fe0 - and carbon steel by the nitrate-reducing Prolixibacter strains was deduced to be mainly enhanced via the biological reduction of nitrate to nitrite, followed by the chemical oxidation of Fe0 to Fe2+ and Fe3+ coupled to the reduction of nitrite.","51":null,"52":"Defense compounds generally inhibit microbial colonization of plants. In this study, we examined the presence of endophytes in Passiflora edulis seeds that accumulate resveratrol and piceatannol at extremely high levels as defense compounds. Interestingly, although no microbial colonies appeared on an agar growth medium from the cut or homogenized seeds, colonies were generated from cut seedlings derived from the seeds. A total of 19 bacterial strains were isolated, of which 15 were classified as Gram-positive. As we hypothesized that extremely high levels of piceatannol in the seeds would inhibit the growth of endophytes cultured directly from the seeds, we examined the antimicrobial activity of this compound against the isolated bacteria. Piceatannol exerted bacteriostatic rather than bactericidal effects on most of the bacteria tested. These results suggest that the bacteria remain static in the seeds due to the presence of piceatannol and are transmitted to the seedlings during the germination process, enabling colonies to be established from the seedlings on the agar medium. We also investigated the biocatalytic activity of the isolated bacteria toward resveratrol and piceatannol. One bacterium, Brevibacterium sp. PE28-2, converted resveratrol and piceatannol to their respective derivatives. This strain is the first endophyte shown to exhibit such activity.","53":null,"54":null,"55":null,"56":null,"57":"The imperfect denitrifier, Candidatus (Ca.) Desulfobacillus denitrificans, which lacks nitric oxide (NO) reductase, frequently appears in anammox bioreactors depending on the operating conditions. We used genomic and metatranscriptomic analyses to evaluate the metabolic potential of Ca. D. denitrificans and deduce its functional relationships to anammox bacteria (i.e., Ca. Brocadia pituitae). Although Ca. D. denitrificans is hypothesized to supply NO to Ca. B. pituitae as a byproduct of imperfect denitrification, this microbe also possesses hydroxylamine oxidoreductase, which catalyzes the oxidation of hydroxylamine to NO and potentially the reverse reaction. Ca. D. denitrificans can use a range of electron donors for denitrification, including aromatic compounds, glucose, sulfur compounds, and hydrogen, but metatranscriptomic analysis suggested that the major electron donors are aromatic compounds, which inhibit anammox activity. The interrelationship between Ca. D. denitirificans and Ca. B. pituitae via the metabolism of aromatic compounds may govern the population balance of both species. Ca. D. denitrificans also has the potential to fix CO2 via an irregular Calvin cycle and couple denitrification to the oxidation of hydrogen and sulfur compounds under chemolithoautotrophic conditions. This metabolic versatility, which suggests a mixotrophic lifestyle, would facilitate the growth of Ca. D. denitrificans in the anammox bioreactor.","58":"Biogeography in Europe is known to be crucially influenced by the large mountain ranges serving as biogeographical islands for cold-adapted taxa and geographical barriers for warm-adapted taxa. While biogeographical patterns are well-known for plants and animals in Europe, we here investigated diversity and distribution patterns of protist freshwater communities on a European scale (256 lakes) in the light of the well-studied post-glacial distribution patterns of macroorganisms. Thus, our study compared 43 alpine protist communities of lakes located in the Alps, Carpathians, Pyrenees, and the Sierra Nevada with that of surrounding lowland lakes. We verified altitudinal diversity gradients of freshwater protists with decreasing richness and diversity across altitudes similar to those observed for plants and animals. Alpine specialists and generalists could be identified differing significantly in richness and diversity, but hardly in occurrence and proportions of major taxonomic groups. High proportions of region-specific alpine specialists indicate an increased occurrence of distinct lineages within each mountain range and thus, suggested either separated glacial refugia or post-glacial diversification within mountain ranges. However, a few alpine specialists were shared between mountain ranges suggesting a post-glacial recolonization from a common lowland pool. Our results identified generalists with wide distribution ranges and putatively wide tolerance ranges toward environmental conditions as main drivers of protist diversification (specification) in alpine lakes, while there was hardly any diversification in alpine specialists.","59":"The permanently stratified water columns in euxinic meromictic lakes produce niche environments for phototrophic sulfur oxidizers and diverse sulfur metabolisms.

Here, we present the results of next-generation sequencing of the eubacterial community in the context of the water column geochemistry. We observed abundant purple and green sulfur bacteria, as well as anoxygenic photosynthesis-capable cyanobacteria within the upper monimolimnion. Amidst the phototrophs, we found other sulfur-cycling bacteria including sulfur disproportionators and chemotrophic sulfur oxidizers, further detailing our understanding of the sulfur cycle and microbial ecology of euxinic, meromictic lakes.","60":null,"61":"Naphthenic acids (NAs) are carboxylic acids with the formula (Cn H2n + Z O2 ) and are among the most toxic, persistent constituents of oil sands process-affected waters (OSPW), produced during oil sands extraction. Currently, the proteins and mechanisms involved in NA biodegradation are unknown. Using LC-MS\/MS shotgun proteomics, we identified proteins overexpressed during the growth of Pseudomonas fluorescens Pf-5 on a model NA (4'-n-butylphenyl)-4-butanoic acid (n-BPBA) and commercial NA mixture (Acros). By day 11, &gt;95% of n-BPBA was degraded. With Acros, a 17% reduction in intensity occurred with 10-18 carbon compounds of the Z family -2 to -14 (major NA species in this mixture). A total of 554 proteins (n-BPBA) and 631 proteins (Acros) were overexpressed during growth on NAs, including several transporters (e.g., ABC transporters), suggesting a cellular protective response from NA toxicity. Several proteins associated with fatty acid, lipid, and amino acid metabolism were also overexpressed, including acyl-CoA dehydrogenase and acyl-CoA thioesterase II, which catalyze part of the fatty acid beta-oxidation pathway. Indeed, multiple enzymes involved in the fatty acid oxidation pathway were upregulated. Given the presumed structural similarity between alkyl-carboxylic acid side chains and fatty acids, we postulate that P. fluorescens Pf-5 was using existing fatty acid catabolic pathways (among others) during NA degradation.","62":null,"63":"The enormous complexity of the eukaryotic ribosome has been a real challenge in unlocking the mechanistic aspects of its amazing molecular function during mRNA translation and many non-canonical activities of ribosomal proteins in eukaryotic cells.

Inhibiting IE surface P2 either by monoclonal antibody or through genetic knockdown resulted in nuclear division arrest of the parasite.

Basal ice (BI) ecology and the roles that the microbiota play in biogeochemical cycling, weathering, and proglacial soil formation remain poorly described. We report on basal ice geochemistry, bacterial diversity (16S rRNA gene phylogeny), and inferred ecological roles at three temperate Icelandic glaciers. We sampled three physically distinct basal ice facies (stratified, dispersed, and debris bands) and found facies dependent on biological similarities and differences; basal ice character is therefore an important sampling consideration in future studies. Based on a high abundance of silicates and Fe-containing minerals and, compared to earlier BI literature, total C was detected that could sustain the basal ice ecosystem. It was hypothesized that C-fixing chemolithotrophic bacteria, especially Fe-oxidisers and hydrogenotrophs, mutualistically support associated heterotrophic communities. Basal ice-derived rRNA gene sequences corresponding to genera known to harbor hydrogenotrophic methanogens suggest that silicate comminution-derived hydrogen can also be utilized for methanogenesis. PICRUSt-predicted metabolism suggests that methane metabolism and C-fixation pathways could be highly relevant in BI, indicating the importance of these metabolic routes. The nutrients and microbial communities release from melting basal ice may play an important role in promoting pioneering communities establishment and soil development in deglaciating forelands.","65":null,"66":null,"67":null,"68":"The application of endophytic bacteria, particularly members of the genus Bacillus, offers a promising strategy for the biocontrol of plant fungal diseases, owing to their sustainability and ecological safety. Although multiple secondary metabolites that demonstrate antifungal capacity have been identified in diverse endophytic bacteria, the regulatory mechanisms of their biosynthesis remain largely unknown. To elucidate this, we sequenced the entire genome of Bacillus amyloliquefaciens GKT04, a strain isolated from banana root, which showed high inhibitory activity against Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. cubense race 4 (FOC4). The GKT04 genome consists of a circular chromosome and a circular plasmid, which harbors 4,087 protein-coding genes and 113 RNA genes. Eight gene clusters that could potentially encode antifungal components were identified. We further applied RNA-Seq analysis to survey genome-wide changes in the gene expression of strain GKT04 during its inhibition of FOC4. In total, 575 upregulated and 242 downregulated genes enriched in several amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism pathways were identified. Specifically, gene clusters associated with difficidin, bacillibactin, and bacilysin were significantly upregulated, and their gene regulatory networks were constructed. Our work thereby provides insights into the genomic features and gene expression patterns of this B. amyloliquefaciens strain, which presents an excellent potential for the biocontrol of Fusarium wilt.","69":null,"70":null,"71":null,"72":null,"73":"The Black Sea is the largest semi-closed permanently anoxic basin on our planet with long-term stratification. The study aimed at describing the Black Sea microbial community taxonomic and functional composition within the range of depths spanning across oxic\/anoxic interface, and to uncover the factors behind both their vertical and regional differentiation. 16S rRNA gene MiSeq sequencing was applied to get the data on microbial community taxonomy, and the PICRUSt pipeline was used to infer their functional profile. The normoxic zone was mainly inhabited by primary producers and heterotrophic prokaryotes (e.g., Flavobacteriaceae, Rhodobacteraceae, Synechococcaceae) whereas the euxinic zone-by heterotrophic and chemoautotrophic taxa (e.g., MSBL2, Piscirickettsiaceae, and Desulfarculaceae). Assimilatory sulfate reduction and oxygenic photosynthesis were prevailing within the normoxic zone, while the role of nitrification, dissimilatory sulfate reduction, and anoxygenic photosynthesis increased in the oxygen-depleted water column part. Regional differentiation of microbial communities between the Ukrainian shelf and offshore zone was detected as well, yet it was significantly less pronounced than the vertical one. It is suggested that regional differentiation within a well-oxygenated zone is driven by the difference in phytoplankton communities providing various substrates for the prokaryotes, whereas redox stratification is the main driving force behind microbial community vertical structure.","74":null,"75":null,"76":null,"77":null,"78":null,"79":"Aquatic ecosystems are often stratified, with cyanobacteria in oxic layers and phototrophic sulfur bacteria in anoxic zones. Changes in stratification caused by the global environmental change are an ongoing concern. Increasing understanding of how such aerobic and anaerobic microbial communities, and associated abiotic conditions, respond to multifarious environmental changes is an important endeavor in microbial ecology. Insights can come from observational and experimental studies of naturally occurring stratified aquatic ecosystems, theoretical models of ecological processes, and experimental studies of replicated microbial communities in the laboratory. Here, we demonstrate a laboratory-based approach with small, replicated, and liquid-dominated Winogradsky columns, with distinct oxic\/anoxic strata in a highly replicable manner. Our objective was to apply simultaneous global change scenarios (temperature, nutrient addition) on this micro-ecosystem to report how the microbial communities (full-length 16S rRNA gene seq.) and the abiotic conditions (O2 , H2 S, TOC) of the oxic\/anoxic layer responded to these environmental changes. The composition of the strongly stratified microbial communities was greatly affected by temperature and by the interaction of temperature and nutrient addition, demonstrating the need of investigating global change treatments simultaneously. Especially phototrophic sulfur bacteria dominated the water column at higher temperatures and may indicate the presence of alternative stable states. We show that the establishment of such a micro-ecosystem has the potential to test global change scenarios in stratified eutrophic limnic systems.","80":"Bacterial resistance toward broad-spectrum antibiotics has become a major concern in recent years. The threat posed by the infectious bacteria and the pace with which resistance determinants are transmitted needs to be deciphered. Soil and water contain unique and diverse microbial communities as well as pools of naturally occurring antibiotics resistant genes. Overuse of antibiotics along with poor sanitary practices expose these indigenous microbial communities to antibiotic resistance genes from other bacteria and accelerate the process of acquisition and dissemination. Clinical settings, where most antibiotics are prescribed, are hypothesized to serve as a major hotspot. The predisposition of the surrounding environments to a pool of antibiotic-resistant bacteria facilitates rapid antibiotic resistance among the indigenous microbiota in the soil, water, and clinical environments via horizontal gene transfer. This provides favorable conditions for the development of more multidrug-resistant pathogens. Limitations in detecting gene transfer mechanisms have likely left us underestimating the role played by the surrounding environmental hotspots in the emergence of multidrug-resistant bacteria. This review aims to identify the major drivers responsible for the spread of antibiotic resistance and hotspots responsible for the acquisition of antibiotic resistance genes.","81":null,"82":null,"83":null,"84":null,"85":"Tularemia is a zoonotic disease of global proportions. Francisella tularensis subspecies tularensis (type A) and holarctica (type B) cause disease in healthy humans, with type A infections resulting in higher mortality. Repeated passage of a type B strain in the mid-20th century generated the Live Vaccine Strain (LVS). LVS remains unlicensed, does not protect against high inhalational doses of type A, and its exact mechanisms of attenuation are poorly understood. Recent data suggest that live attenuated vaccines derived from type B may cross-protect against type A. However, there is a dearth of knowledge regarding virulent type B pathogenesis and its capacity to stimulate the host's innate immune response. We therefore sought to increase our understanding of virulent type B in vitro characteristics using strain OR96-0246 as a model. Adding to our knowledge of innate immune kinetics in macrophages following infection with virulent type B, we observed robust replication of strain OR96-0246 in murine and human macrophages, reduced expression of pro-inflammatory cytokine genes from \"wild type\" type B-infected macrophages compared to LVS, and delayed macrophage cell death suggesting that virulent type B may suppress macrophage activation. One disruption in LVS is in the gene encoding the chloride transporter ClcA. We investigated the role of ClcA in macrophage infection and observed a replication delay in a clcA mutant. Here, we propose its role in acid tolerance. A greater understanding of LVS attenuation may reveal new mechanisms of pathogenesis and inform strategies toward the development of an improved vaccine against tularemia.","86":"Age is known to affect the gut microbiota in various animals; however, this relationship is poorly understood in seabirds. We investigated the temporal succession of gut microbiota in captive chinstrap penguins of different ages using high-throughput sequencing. The gut microbiota exhibited a significant age succession pattern, reaching maturity in adults and then declining with increasing age. Only 15 amplicon sequence variants were shared among the gut microbiota in chinstrap penguins at all studied ages, and these contributed to most of the age-related variations in total gut microbiota. Co-occurrence networks found that these key bacteria belonged to the genera Acinetobacter, Clostridium sensu stricto, and Fusobacterium, and more species interactions were found within the same taxonomy. Functional prediction indicated that most of the metabolic functions were more abundant in the gut microbiota in adult chinstrap penguins, except for carbohydrate metabolism, which was significantly more abundant in older individuals.","87":null,"88":"The healthy vaginal microbiota is dominated by Lactobacillus spp., which provide an important critical line of defense against pathogens, as well as giving beneficial effects to the host.

Their beneficial properties in terms of ability to interfere with vaginal pathogens (co-aggregation, adhesion to HeLa cells, biofilm formation) and antimicrobial activity mediated by CFSs were assessed against multidrug urogenital pathogens (S. agalactiae, E. coli, KPC-producing K. pneumoniae, S. aureus, E. faecium VRE, E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa, P. mirabilis, P. vulgaris, C. albicans, C. glabrata). The Lactobacilli tested exhibited an extraordinary ability to interfere and co-aggregate with urogenital pathogens, except for Candida spp., as well as to adhere to HeLa cells and to produce biofilm in the Lactobacillus combination. Lactobacillus CFSs and their combination revealed a strong bactericidal effect on the multidrug resistant indicator strains tested, except for E. faecium and E. faecalis. The antimicrobial activity was maintained after heat treatment but decreased after enzymatic treatment. All Lactobacilli showed lactic dehydrogenase activity and production of D- and L-lactic acid isomers on Lactobacillus CFSs, while only 1A-TV and 35A-TV released hydrogen peroxide and carried helveticin J and acidocin A bacteriocins. These results suggest that they can be employed as a new vaginal probiotic formulation and bio-therapeutic preparation against urogenital infections. Further, in vivo studies are needed to evaluate human health benefits in clinical situations.","89":"Human body malodour is a complex phenomenon. Several types of sweat glands produce odorless secretions that are metabolized by a consortium of skin-resident microorganisms to a diverse set of malodorous substances. Isovaleric acid, a sweaty-smelling compound, is one major malodorous component produced by staphylococci with the skin-derived amino acid L-leucine as a substrate. During wearing, fabrics are contaminated with sweat and microorganisms and high humidity propagates growth and microbial malodour production. Incomplete removal of sweat residues and microorganisms from fabrics during laundry with bleach-free detergents and at low temperatures elevate the problem of textile malodour. This study aimed to analyze the inhibitory effect of the antimicrobial 4,4' dichloro 2-hydroxydiphenyl ether (DCPP) on the formation of isovaleric acid on fabrics. Therefore, GC-FID- and GC-MS-based methods for the analysis of isovaleric acid in an artificial human sweat-mimicking medium and in textile extracts were established. Here, we show that antimicrobials capable to deposit on fabrics during laundry, such as DCPP, are effective in growth inhibition of typical malodour-generating bacteria and prevent the staphylococcal formation of isovaleric acid on fabrics in a simple experimental setup. This can contribute to increased hygiene for mild laundry care approaches, where bacterial contamination and malodour production represent a considerable consumer problem.","90":null,"91":"Cigar tobacco leaves (CTLs) contain abundant bacteria and fungi that are vital to leaf quality during fermentation. In this study, artificial fermentation was used for the fermentation of CTLs since it was more controllable and efficient than natural aging. The bacterial and fungal community structure and composition in unfermented and fermented CTLs were determined to understand the effects of microbes on the characteristics of CTLs during artificial fermentation. The relationship between the chemical contents and alterations in the microbial composition was evaluated, and the functions of bacteria and fungi in fermented CTLs were predicted to determine the possible metabolic pathways. After artificial fermentation, the bacterial and fungal community structure significantly changed in CTLs. The total nitrate and nicotine contents were most readily affected by the bacterial and fungal communities, respectively. FAPROTAX software predictions of the bacterial community revealed increases in functions related to compound transformation after fermentation. FUNGuild predictions of the fungal community revealed an increase in the content of saprotrophic fungi after fermentation. These data provide information regarding the artificial fermentation mechanism of CTLs and will inform safety and quality improvements.","92":null,"93":null,"94":null,"95":null,"96":null,"97":"Aging is a critical factor affecting physical health and disease in mammals. Emerging evidence indicates that aging may affect the gut bacteriome in cynomolgus macaques, but little is known about whether or how the gut virome changes with age. Here, we compared the DNA gut viral composition of 16 female cynomolgus monkeys (Macaca fascicularis) at three life stages (young, adult, and old) using the shotgun metagenome sequencing method. We found that the DNA gut virome from these monkeys differed substantially among the three groups. The gut viruses were dominated by bacteriophages, the most abundant of which was the Caudovirales order (i.e., Siphoviridae, Myoviridae, and Podoviridae families). Additionally, the co-occurrence analysis revealed that the age-related bacteriophages were correlated in an extensive and complex manner with the main intestinal bacteria (i.e., Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria phyla). Furthermore, the age-related DNA gut viral functions were enriched for genetic information processing, nucleotide, and folate metabolism. Our gut virome analysis provides new insight into how aging influences the gut virome of non-human primates.","98":"Nutrients including glucose, nitrogen, sulfur, zinc, and iron are involved in the regulation of chronological lifespan (CLS) of yeast, which serves as a model of the lifespan of differentiated cells of higher organisms. Herein, we show that magnesium (Mg2+ ) depletion extends CLS of the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe through a mechanism involving the Ecl1 gene family. We discovered that ecl1+ expression, which extends CLS, responds to Mg2+ depletion. Therefore, we investigated the underlying intracellular responses. In amino acid auxotrophic strains, Mg2+ depletion robustly induces ecl1+ expression through the activation of the general amino acid control (GAAC) pathway-the equivalent of the amino acid response of mammals. Polysome analysis indicated that the expression of Ecl1 family genes was required for regulating ribosome amount when cells were starved, suggesting that Ecl1 family gene products control the abundance of ribosomes, which contributes to longevity through the activation of the evolutionarily conserved GAAC pathway. The present study extends our understanding of the cellular response to Mg2+ depletion and its influence on the mechanism controlling longevity.","99":null,"100":"The microbiome of flowers (anthosphere) is an understudied compartment of the plant microbiome. Within the flower, petals represent a heterogeneous environment for microbes in terms of resources and environmental stress. Yet, little is known of drivers of structure and function of the epiphytic microbial community at the within-petal scale. We characterized the petal microbiome in two co-flowering plants that differ in the pattern of ultraviolet (UV) absorption along their petals. Bacterial communities were similar between plant hosts, with only rare phylogenetically distant species contributing to differences. The epiphyte community was highly culturable (75% of families) lending confidence in the spatially explicit isolation and characterization of bacteria. In one host, petals were heterogeneous in UV absorption along their length, and in these, there was a negative relationship between growth rate and position on the petal, as well as lower UV tolerance in strains isolated from the UV-absorbing base than from UV reflecting tip. A similar pattern was not seen in microbes isolated from a second host whose petals had uniform patterning along their length. Across strains, the variation in carbon usage and chemical tolerance followed common phylogenetic patterns. This work highlights the value of petals for spatially explicit explorations of bacteria of the anthosphere.","101":null,"102":null,"103":"Recently, indoor swimming pool activities have increased to promote health-enhancing physical activities, which require establishing suitable protocols for disinfection and water quality control. Normally, the assessment of the microbial quality of the water in the pools only considers the presence of different bacteria. However, other less frequent but more resistant pathogens, such as free-living amoebas (FLA), are not contemplated in both existing recommendation and research activities. FLA represent a relevant human health risk, not only due to their pathogenicity but also due to the ability to act as vehicles of other pathogens, such as bacteria. Therefore, this work aimed to study the physicochemical characteristics and the occurrence of potentially pathogenic FLA and bacteria in water samples from 20 public indoor swimming facilities in Northern Portugal. Our results showed that some swimming pools presented levels of pH, free chlorine, and conductivity out of the recommended limits. Pathogenic FLA species were detected in two of the facilities under study, where we also report the presence of both, FLA and pathogenic bacteria. Our findings evidence the need to assess the occurrence of FLA and their existence in the same environmental niche as pathogenic bacteria in swimming pool facilities worldwide and to establish recommendations to safeguard the health of the users.","104":"Cheatgrass (Bromus tectorum L.) is an invasive annual grass (Poaceae) that has colonized large portions of the Intermountain West. Cheatgrass stand failures have been observed throughout the invaded region, the cause of which may be related to the presence of several species of pathogenic fungi in the soil or surface litter. In this metabarcoding study, we compared the fungal communities between sites that have and have not experienced stand failure. Samples were taken from the soil and surface litter near Winnemucca, Nevada, and in Skull Valley, Utah. Our results show distinct fungal communities associated with stand failure based on both geography and sample type. In both the Winnemucca and Skull Valley surface litter, there was an elevated abundance of the endophyte Ramimonilia apicalis in samples that had experienced a stand failure. Winnemucca surface litter stand failure samples had an increased abundance of a potential pathogen in the genus Comoclathris. Skull Valley surface litter stand failure samples had an increased abundance of an undescribed new species in the Rustroemiaceae family which is responsible for the so-called bleach blonde syndrome in cheatgrass, while the soils had an increased abundance of potential pathogens in the genera Olpidium and Monosporascus.","105":"It is a widespread practice in China to keep colonies of both the western honey bee, Apis mellifera, and the eastern honey bee, Apis cerana, in close proximity. However, this practice increases opportunities for spillover of parasites and pathogens between the two host bee species, impacting spatial and temporal patterns in the occurrence and prevalence of the viruses that adversely affect bee health. We conducted a 1-year large-scale survey to assess the current status of viral infection in both A. mellifera and A. cerana in China. Our study focused on multiple aspects of viral infections in honey bees, including infection rate, viral load, seasonal variation, regional variation, and phylogenetic relationships of the viruses within the same species found in this study and other parts of the world. The survey showed that the black queen cell virus (BQCV), deformed wing virus (DWV), Israeli acute paralysis virus (IAPV), and sacbrood virus (SBV) were common in both A. mellifera and A. cerana, and infection dynamics of BQCV, DWV, and SBV between bee species or seasons were significantly different. DWV was the most common virus in A. mellifera, and its infection rate and load in A. mellifera were higher than those in A. cerana, which reflects the high susceptibility of A. mellifera to Varroa destructor infestation. The infection rate and viral load of SBV were higher in A. cerana than in A. mellifera, indicating that SBV poses a greater threat to A. cerana than to A. mellifera. Our results also suggested that there was no geographical variation in viral dynamics in A. mellifera and A. cerana. Phylogenetic analyses of BQCV, DWV, IAPV, and SBV suggested the cross-regional and cross-species spread of these viruses. This study provides important insights into the complex relationships between viruses and their hosts in different seasons and regions, which will be important for developing effective disease management strategies to improve bee health.","106":null,"107":null,"108":"Yangia sp.

In this study, the potential of the bacterium for co-production of exopolysaccharides (EPS) and PHA was investigated. Genome sequence analysis of the closely related Yangia sp. CCB-M3 isolated from mangroves in Malaysia revealed genes encoding enzymes participating in different EPS biosynthetic pathways. The effects of various cultivation parameters on the production of EPS and PHA were studied. The highest level of EPS (288 mg\/L) was achieved using sucrose and yeast extract with 5% NaCl and 120 mM phosphate salts but with modest PHA accumulation (32% of cell dry weight, 1.3 g\/L). Growth on fructose yielded the highest PHA concentration (85% of CDW, 3.3 g\/L) at 90 mM phosphate and higher molecular weight EPS at 251 mg\/L yield at 120 mM phosphate concentration.

The problem is caused by the high toxicity of butanol to the production cells, and therefore, understanding the mechanisms by which clostridia react to butanol shock is of key importance. Detailed analyses of transcriptome data that were obtained after butanol shock and their comparison with data from standard ABE fermentation have resulted in new findings, while confirmed expected population responses. Although butanol shock resulted in upregulation of heat shock protein genes, their regulation is different than was assumed based on standard ABE fermentation transcriptome data. While glucose uptake, glycolysis, and acidogenesis genes were downregulated after butanol shock, solventogenesis genes were upregulated. Cyclopropanation of fatty acids and formation of plasmalogens seem to be significant processes involved in cell membrane stabilization in the presence of butanol. Surprisingly, one of the three identified Agr quorum-sensing system genes was upregulated. Upregulation of several putative butanol efflux pumps was described after butanol addition and a large putative polyketide gene cluster was found, the transcription of which seemed to depend on the concentration of butanol.","123":null,"124":null,"125":"Microbial diversity studies regarding the aquatic communities that experienced or are experiencing environmental problems are essential for the comprehension of the remediation dynamics. In this pilot study, we present data on the phylogenetic and ecological structure of microorganisms from epipelagic water samples collected in the Small Aral Sea (SAS). The raw data were generated by massive parallel sequencing using the shotgun approach. As expected, most of the identified DNA sequences belonged to Terrabacteria and Actinobacteria (40% and 37% of the total reads, respectively). The occurrence of Deinococcus-Thermus, Armatimonadetes, Chloroflexi in the epipelagic SAS waters was less anticipated. Surprising was also the detection of sequences, which are characteristic for strict anaerobes-Ignavibacteria, hydrogen-oxidizing bacteria, and archaeal methanogenic species. We suppose that the observed very broad range of phylogenetic and ecological features displayed by the SAS reads demonstrates a more intensive mixing of water masses originating from diverse ecological niches of the Aral-Syr Darya River basin than presumed before.","126":null,"127":"Mosquitoes utilize their sense of smell to locate prey and feed on their blood. Repellents interfere with the biochemical cascades that detect odors. Consequently, repellants are highly effective and resource-efficient alternatives for controlling the spread of mosquito-borne illnesses. Unfortunately, the discovery of repellents is slow, laborious, and error-prone. To this end, we have taken a giant stride toward improving the speed and accuracy of repellant discovery by constructing a prototypical whole-cell biosensor for accurate detection of mosquito behavior-modifying compounds such as repellants. As a proof-of-concept, we genetically engineered Pichia pastoris to express the olfactory receptor co-receptor (Orco) of Anopheles gambiae mosquitoes. This transmembrane protein behaves like a cationic channel upon activation by stimulatory odorants. When the engineered Pichia cells are cultured in calcium-containing Hank's buffer, induction of the medium with a stimulatory odorant results in an influx of calcium ions into the cells, and the stimulatory effect is quantifiable using the calcium-sequestering fluorescent dye, fluo-4-acetoxymethyl ester. Moreover, the stimulatory effect can be titrated by adjusting either the concentration of calcium ions in the medium or the level of induction of the stimulatory odorant. Subsequent exposure of the activated Pichia cells to a repellant molecule inhibits the stimulatory effect and quenches the fluorescent signal, also in a titratable manner. Significantly, the modular architecture of the biosensor allows easy and efficient expansion of its detection range by co-expressing Orco with other olfactory receptors. The high-throughput assay is also compatible with robotic screening infrastructure, and our development represents a paradigm change for the discovery of mosquito repellants.","128":null,"129":null,"130":null,"131":null,"132":"Congenital Zika syndrome is caused by mother-to-fetus transmission of the Zika virus (ZIKV).

ZIKV-infected pregnant conditions generally overexpressed M1-shifted pro-inflammatory responses and underexpressed M2-shifted anti-inflammatory responses. Additionally, transcripts involved in osteoclast differentiation and cardiac myopathies were upregulated following ZIKV infection.

Proof-of-concept results showed low vector yields that correlated with low AAV DNA encapsidation rates. In an attempt to understand the host cell response to rAAV production, we profiled proteomic changes throughout the fermentation process by mass spectrometry. By comparing an rAAV-producing yeast strain with a respective non-producer control, we identified a subset of yeast host proteins with significantly different expression patterns during the rAAV induction period. Gene ontology enrichment and network interaction analyses identified changes in expression patterns associated mainly with protein folding, as well as amino acid metabolism, gluconeogenesis, and stress response. Specific fold change patterns of heat shock proteins and other stress protein markers suggested the occurrence of a cytosolic unfolded protein response during rAAV protein expression. Also, a correlative increase in proteins involved in response to oxidative stress suggested cellular activities to ameliorate the effects of reactive oxygen species or other oxidants. We tested the functional relevance of the identified host proteins by overexpressing selected protein leads using low- and high-copy number plasmids. Increased vector yields up to threefold were observed in clones where proteins SSA1, SSE1, SSE2, CCP1, GTT1, and RVB2 were overexpressed. Recombinant expression of SSA1 and YDJ insect homologues (HSP40 and HSC70, respectively) in Sf9 cells led to a volumetric vector yield increase of 50% relative to control, which validated the importance of chaperone proteins in rAAV-producing systems. Overall, these results highlight the utility of proteomic-based tools for the understanding and optimization of rAAV-producing recombinant strains.","135":"To assess a cost-effective in-house selective plate formula for actively screening carbapenem-resistant Enterobacteriaceae (CRE).

American Type Culture Collection strains and 200 clinical strains were used to validate the plate formula. The CRE plates had a sensitivity of 97.4% and a specificity of 98.8% with ATCC andor clinical strains used in the quality control procedure. A point prevalence survey among the 18 inpatients at Viet-Tiep hospital ICU using fecal swabs plated at the in-house agar plate showed a CRE prevalence of 44.4%. The in-house plate had high sensitivity and specificity, particularly for Escherichia coli and the KESC group (Klebsiella spp., Enterobacter spp., Serratia marscescens, and Citrobacter spp.), and it may be widely applied as an alternative to other ready-to-use commercial plates. The formula developed in the present study may facilitate the early detection and isolation of CRE and decrease transmission, particularly in low- and middle-income countries with a high rate of CRE colonization and limited access to ready-to-use commercial plates. ","136":"Antimicrobial resistance is one of the major threats to the health and welfare of both humans and animals. The shortage of new antimicrobial agents has led to the re-evaluation of old antibiotics such as fosfomycin as a potential regimen for treating multidrug-resistant bacteria especially extended-spectrum-beta-lactamase- and carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Fosfomycin is a broad-spectrum bactericidal antibiotic that inhibits the initial step of the cell wall biosynthesis. Fosfomycin resistance can occur due to mutation in the drug uptake system or by the acquisition of fosfomycin-modifying enzymes. In this review, we focus on mobile fosfomycin-resistant genes encoding glutathione-S-transferase which are mainly responsible for fosfomycin resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, that is, fosA and its subtypes, fosC2, and the recently described fosL1-L2. We summarized the proposed origins of the different resistance determinants and highlighted the different plasmid types which are attributed to the dissemination of fosfomycin-modifying enzymes. Thereby, IncF and IncN plasmids play a predominant role. The detection of mobile fosfomycin-resistant genes in Enterobacteriaceae has increased in recent years. Similar to the situation in (East) Asia, the most frequently detected fosfomycin-resistant gene in Europe is fosA3. Mobile fosfomycin-resistant genes have been detected in isolates of human, animal, food, and environmental origin which leads to a growing concern regarding the risk of spread of such bacteria, especially Escherichia coli and Salmonella, at the human-animal-environment interface.","137":"Antimicrobial resistance poses a great danger to humanity, in part due to the widespread horizontal gene transfer of plasmids via conjugation. Modeling of plasmid transfer is essential to uncovering the fundamentals of resistance transfer and for the development of predictive measures to limit the spread of resistance. However, a major limitation in the current understanding of plasmids is the incomplete characterization of the conjugative DNA transfer mechanisms, which conceals the actual potential for plasmid transfer in nature. Here, we consider that the plasmid-borne origin-of-transfer substrates encode specific DNA structural properties that can facilitate finding these regions in large datasets and develop a DNA structure-based alignment procedure for typing the transfer substrates that outperforms sequence-based approaches. Thousands of putative DNA transfer substrates are identified, showing that plasmid mobility can be twofold higher and span almost twofold more host species than is currently known. Over half of all putative mobile plasmids contain the means for mobilization by conjugation systems belonging to different mobility groups, which can hypothetically link previously confined host ranges across ecological habitats into a robust plasmid transfer network. This hypothetical network is found to facilitate the transfer of antimicrobial resistance from environmental genetic reservoirs to human pathogens, which might be an important driver of the observed rapid resistance development in humans and thus an important point of focus for future prevention measures.","138":null,"139":"Deep learning has the potential to enhance the output of in-line, on-line, and at-line instrumentation used for process analytical technology in the pharmaceutical industry.

A major limitation to DEPT is the poor effectiveness of the most studied enzyme for the CB1954 prodrug, NfnB from Escherichia coli, at concentrations suitable for human use. Much research into finding alternative enzymes to NfnB has resulted in the identification of the Xenobiotic reductases, XenA and XenB, which have been shown in the literature to reduce environmentally polluting nitro-compounds. In this study, they were assessed for their potential use in cancer prodrug therapy strategies. Both proteins were cloned into the pET28a+ expression vector to give the genetically modified proteins XenA-his and XenB-his, of which only XenB-his was active when tested with CB1954. XenB-his was further modified to include a cysteine-tag to facilitate direct immobilization on to a gold surface for future magnetic nanoparticle DEPT (MNDEPT) treatments and was named XenB-cys. When tested using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC), XenB-his and XenB-cys both demonstrated a preference for reducing CB1954 at the 4-nitro position. Furthermore, XenB-his and XenB-cys successfully induced cell death in SK-OV-3 cells when combined with CB1954.

Members of this family bind to extracellular matrix components such as collagen and fibronectin, but also they exhibit several other functions, such as conferring serum resistance and autoaggregation. Autoaggregation promoted by TAAs is homotypic and mediated by the sticky, globular head domains of these lollipop-like molecules. However, whether TAAs mediate heterotypic interactions (i.e., coaggregation) has not been studied. To address this question, we investigated the coaggregation of two model TAA groups: YadA from the enteropathogenic Yersiniae and the immunoglobulin-binding Eib proteins from Escherichia coli. To study TAA coaggregation, we coexpressed a fluorescent label together with a particular TAA and followed the aggregative interactions using fluorescence microscopy and quantified the interactions using a novel script implemented in Fiji. Our results show that there is coaggregation between some populations expressing different TAAs, which can be explained by relatively high sequence similarity between the interacting TAAs. Generally, the level of coaggregation correlated with the sequence similarity. However, some TAAs did not interact despite high sequence similarity, showing exclusion of bacteria producing a noncompatible TAA. These data demonstrate that TAAs can mediate bacterial coaggregation, but in some cases prevent coaggregation of bacteria with disparate TAAs. Our results have implications for the ecology of TAA-producing bacteria, where coaggregation may promote co-operation whereas exclusion might be an indication of competition.","151":null,"152":"A large variety of microbes are present in the human gut, some of which are considered to interact with each other. Most of these interactions involve bacterial metabolites. Phascolarctobacterium faecium hardly uses carbohydrates for growth and instead uses succinate as a substrate. This study investigated the growth behavior of the co-culture of the succinate-specific utilizer P. faecium and the succinogenic gut commensal Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron. Succinate production by B. thetaiotaomicron supported the growth of P. faecium and concomitant propionate production via the succinate pathway. The succinate produced was completely converted to propionate. This result was comparable with the monoculture of P. faecium in the medium supplemented with 1% (w\/v) succinate. We analyzed the transcriptional response (RNA-Seq) between the mono- and co-culture of P. faecium and B. thetaiotaomicron. Comparison of the expression levels of genes of P. faecium between the mono- and co-cultured conditions highlighted that the genes putatively involved in the transportation of succinate were notably expressed under the co-cultured conditions. Differential expression analysis showed that the presence of P. faecium induced changes in the B. thetaiotaomicron transcriptional pattern, for example, expression changes in the genes for vitamin B12 transporters and reduced expression of glutamate-dependent acid resistance system-related genes. Also, transcriptome analysis of P. faecium suggested that glutamate and succinate might be used as sources of succinyl-CoA, an intermediate in the succinate pathway.

However, the source of contamination on chicken meat is under dispute. Since different studies reported contradictory results on the occurrence of Arcobacter spp. inside the intestinal tract of chicken, our study examined four intestinal compartments at four significant production steps during broiler slaughter and processing in the slaughterhouse. Altogether, 157 intestinal tracts from 19 flocks were examined qualitatively and semiquantitatively applying a selective enrichment. Further verification was performed by mPCR and rpoB sequencing. Arcobacter spp. were only detected sporadically in intestinal contents after bleeding (2\/32) and in none after scalding (0\/32). After defeathering, Arcobacter spp. were detected in 62% (18\/29) of the intestinal contents with 28% (8\/29) of the duodenal, 21% (6\/29) of the jejunal, 3% (1\/29) of the cecal, and 55% (16\/29) of the colonic samples tested positive with loads up to 24,000 MPN\/g in the colonic content. Further 88% (7\/8) of colonic tissue samples were tested positive. After evisceration, the prevalences (58\/64) and loads of Arcobacter spp. display comparable levels in the intestinal contents like after defeathering. In conclusion, our data point out that Arcobacter spp. are most likely detected in the colonic intestinal compartment of the chicken after defeathering and evisceration. Therefore, not only cross-contamination originating from the environment inside the slaughterhouse may cause carcass contamination with Arcobacter spp. on broiler chicken carcasses. The detection of Arcobacter spp. in duodenal and jejunal contents as well as in the colonic tissue indicates that there possibly exists an Arcobacter reservoir inside the chicken.","155":"C57Bl6 (B6) mice devoid of glutathione peroxidases 1 and 2 (Gpx1\/2-DKO) develop ileitis after weaning. We previously showed germ-free Gpx1\/2-DKO mice of mixed B6.129 background did not develop ileocolitis. Here, we examine the composition of the ileitis provoking microbiota in B6 Gpx1\/2-DKO mice. DNA was isolated from the ileum fecal stream and subjected to high-throughput sequencing of the V3 and V4 regions of the 16S rRNA gene to determine the abundance of operational taxonomic units (OTUs). We analyzed the role of bacteria by comparing the microbiomes of the DKO and pathology-free non-DKO mice. Mice were treated with metronidazole, streptomycin, and vancomycin to alter pathology and correlate the OTU abundances with pathology levels. Principal component analysis based on Jaccard distance of abundance showed 3 distinct outcomes relative to the source Gpx1\/2-DKO microbiome. Association analyses of pathology and abundance of OTUs served to rule out 7-11 of 24 OTUs for involvement in the ileitis. Collections of OTUs were identified that appeared to be linked to ileitis in this animal model and would be classified as commensals. In Gpx1\/2-DKO mice, host oxidant generation from NOX1 and DUOX2 in response to commensals may compromise the ileum epithelial barrier, a role generally ascribed to oxidants generated from mitochondria, NOX2 and endoplasmic reticulum stress in response to presumptive pathogens in IBD. Elevated oxidant levels may contribute to epithelial cell shedding, which is strongly associated with progress toward inflammation in Gpx1\/2-DKO mice and predictive of relapse in IBD by allowing leakage of microbial components into the submucosa.","156":null,"157":null,"158":null,"159":"Microbes active in extreme cold are not as well explored as those of other extreme environments.

Our results reveal a more diverse microbiome functional capacity and activity in the early- vs. late-spring samples. We also find that functional dissimilarity between the same-sample metagenomes and metatranscriptomes is significantly higher in early than late spring samples. These findings suggest that early spring samples may contain a larger fraction of DNA of dormant (or dead) organisms, while late spring samples reflect a new, metabolically active community. We further show that the abundance of sequencing reads mapping to the fatty acid synthesis-related microbial pathways in late spring metagenomes and metatranscriptomes is significantly correlated with the organic acid levels measured in these samples. Similarly, the organic acid levels correlate with the pathway read abundances of geraniol degradation and inversely correlate with those of styrene degradation, suggesting a possible nutrient change.

The bacterial community of horse milk cheese had a significantly larger bacterial population size, greater species richness, and a more diverse composition than those of cow and goat milk cheeses. Unlike the absolute dominance of Lactococcus and Streptococcus in cow and goat milk cheeses, Lactobacillus and Streptococcus dominated the bacterial community as the starter lactic acid bacteria in horse milk cheese. Additionally, horse milk cheese also contains a higher abundance of unclassified secondary bacteria and specific secondary bacteria (e.g., Psychrobacter, Sulfurisoma, Halomonas, and Brevibacterium) than cow and goat milk cheeses. These abundant, diverse, and specific starter lactic acid bacteria and secondary bacteria may generate unique nutrition and flavor of horse milk cheese.","162":"The agricultural ecosystem creates a platform for the development and dissemination of antimicrobial resistance, which is promoted by the indiscriminate use of antibiotics in the veterinary, agricultural, and medical sectors. This results in the selective pressure for the intrinsic and extrinsic development of the antimicrobial resistance phenomenon, especially within the aquaculture-animal-manure-soil-water-plant nexus. The existence of antimicrobial resistance in the environment has been well documented in the literature. However, the possible transmission routes of antimicrobial agents, their resistance genes, and naturally selected antibiotic-resistant bacteria within and between the various niches of the agricultural environment and humans remain poorly understood. This study, therefore, outlines an overview of the discovery and development of commonly used antibiotics; the timeline of resistance development; transmission routes of antimicrobial resistance in the agro-ecosystem; detection methods of environmental antimicrobial resistance determinants; factors involved in the evolution and transmission of antibiotic resistance in the environment and the agro-ecosystem; and possible ways to curtail the menace of antimicrobial resistance.","163":null,"164":null,"165":null,"166":"Clostridioides difficile infection (CDI) represents an important health problem worldwide, with significant morbidity and mortality. This infection has also high recurrence rates, whose pathophysiological grounds are still poorly understood. Based on our experiments in vitro with Clostridioides difficile toxin B and existing experimental and clinical evidence, we propose that primary CDI and relapses might be favored by a mechanism that involves the enhancement of the toxicity of toxin B by proinflammatory cytokines, tumor necrosis factor alpha, and interferon gamma on the enteric glial cells and their network in an environment characterized by a strong dysmicrobism.","167":null,"168":"The associated microbiota of marine invertebrates plays an important role to the host in relation to fitness, health, and homeostasis. Cooperative and competitive interactions between bacteria, due to release of, for example, antibacterial substances and quorum sensing (QS)\/quorum quenching (QQ) molecules, ultimately affect the establishment and dynamics of the associated microbial community. Aiming to address interspecies competition of cultivable microbes associated with emerging model species of the basal animal phyla Cnidaria (Aurelia aurita) and Ctenophora (Mnemiopsis leidyi), we performed a classical isolation approach. Overall, 84 bacteria were isolated from A. aurita medusae and polyps, 64 bacteria from M. leidyi, and 83 bacteria from ambient seawater, followed by taxonomically classification by 16S rRNA gene analysis. The results show that A. aurita and M. leidyi harbor a cultivable core microbiome consisting of typical marine ubiquitous bacteria also found in the ambient seawater. However, several bacteria were restricted to one host suggesting host-specific microbial community patterns. Interbacterial interactions were assessed by (a) a growth inhibition assay and (b) QS interference screening assay. Out of 231 isolates, 4 bacterial isolates inhibited growth of 17 isolates on agar plates. Moreover, 121 of the 231 isolates showed QS-interfering activities. They interfered with the acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL)-based communication, of which 21 showed simultaneous interference with autoinducer 2. Overall, this study provides insights into the cultivable part of the microbiota associated with two environmentally important marine non-model organisms and into interbacterial interactions, which are most likely considerably involved in shaping a healthy and resilient microbiota.","169":null,"170":"Few studies have examined the bacterial communities associated with photosynthetic sacoglossan sea slugs. In this study, we determined the bacterial diversity in the clarki ecotype, Elysia crispata using 16S rRNA sequencing. Computational analysis using QIIME2 revealed variability between individual samples, with the Spirochaetes and Bacteroidetes phyla dominating most samples. Tenericutes and Proteobacteria were also found, among other phyla. Computational metabolic profiling of the bacteria revealed a variety of metabolic pathways involving carbohydrate metabolism, lipid metabolism, nucleotide metabolism, and amino acid metabolism. Although associated bacteria may be involved in mutually beneficial metabolic pathways, there was a high degree of variation in the bacterial community of individual slugs. This suggests that many of these relationships are likely opportunistic rather than obligate and that many of these bacteria may live commensally providing no major benefit to the slugs.","171":null,"172":null,"173":null,"174":"Antibiotic-tolerant persisters are often implicated in treatment failure of chronic and relapsing bacterial infections, but the underlying molecular mechanisms have remained elusive. Controversies revolve around the relative contribution of specific genetic switches called toxin-antitoxin (TA) modules and global modulation of cellular core functions such as slow growth. Previous studies on uropathogenic Escherichia coli observed impaired persister formation for mutants lacking the pasTI locus that had been proposed to encode a TA module. Here, we show that pasTI is not a TA module and that the supposed toxin PasT is instead the bacterial homolog of mitochondrial protein Coq10 that enables the functionality of the respiratory electron carrier ubiquinone as a \"lipid chaperone.\" Consistently, pasTI mutants show pleiotropic phenotypes linked to defective electron transport such as decreased membrane potential and increased sensitivity to oxidative stress. We link impaired persister formation of pasTI mutants to a global distortion of cellular stress responses due to defective respiration. Remarkably, the ectopic expression of human coq10 largely complements the respiratory defects and decreased persister levels of pasTI mutants. Our work suggests that PasT\/Coq10 has a central role in respiratory electron transport that is conserved from bacteria to humans and sustains bacterial tolerance to antibiotics.","175":null,"176":null,"177":null,"178":null,"179":null,"180":null,"181":"Two novel reassortant avian influenza A (H3N6) viruses were isolated from swan goose in Poyang Lake, Jiangxi Province, China, in 2014.

As all adaptive processes are underpinned by changes in gene expression, the RNAP can be considered the major mediator of any adaptive response in the bacterial cell. In bacterial pathogens, theoretically, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in genes that encode subunits of the RNAP and associated factors could mediate adaptation and confer a selective advantage to cope with biotic and abiotic stresses. We investigated this possibility by undertaking a systematic survey of SNPs in genes encoding the RNAP and associated factors in a collection of 1,429 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) clinical isolates. We present evidence for the existence of several, hitherto unreported, nonsynonymous SNPs in genes encoding the RNAP and associated factors of MRSA ST22 clinical isolates and propose that the acquisition of amino acid substitutions in the RNAP could represent an adaptive strategy that contributes to the pathogenic success of MRSA.","186":null,"187":"The bacterial microbiota in the gut varies among species, as well as with habitat, diet, age, and other factors. Intestinal microbiota homeostasis allows a host to adjust metabolic and immune performances in response to environmental changes. Therefore, potential implications of the gut microbiota in sustaining the health of the host have gained increasing attention in the field of endangered animal conservation. However, the effect of host intraspecies genetic variation on the gut microbiota is unknown. Moreover, little is known about the complexity of the gut mycobiota. Tigers are listed as endangered species, raising worldwide concern. Potential influences of subspecies, diet, and age on the gut microbiota in tigers were investigated in this study to provide a better understanding of the response of the tiger gut microbiota to external changes. The results revealed that the impacts of the factors listed above on gut bacterial and fungal communities are versatile. Host intraspecies genetic variation significantly impacted only fungal alpha diversity of the gut microbiota. Differences in diet, on the other hand, had a significant impact on alpha diversity of the gut microbiota, but exerted different effects on beta diversity of gut bacterial and fungal communities. Host age had no significant impact on the diversity of the gut fungal communities, but significantly impacted beta diversity of gut bacterial communities. This comprehensive study of tiger gut microbiota is an essential reference for tiger conservation when considering feeding and management strategies, and will contribute to a better understanding of the mycobiota in wildlife.","188":null,"189":null,"190":null,"191":null,"192":null,"193":"The study performed on the stone materials from the Convent of Christ revealed the presence of a complex microbial ecosystem, emphasizing the determinant role of microorganisms on the biodecay of this built cultural heritage.

The implementation of high-throughput sequencing approaches on the Convent of Christ's biodecay assessment allowed us to explore, compare, and characterize the microbial communities, overcoming the limitations of culture-dependent techniques, which only identify the cultivable population. The application of these different tools and insights gave us a panoramic view of the microbiota thriving on the Convent of Christ and signalize the main biodeteriogenic agents acting on the biodecay of stone materials. This finding highlighted the importance of performing metagenomic studies due to the improvements and the reduced amount of sample DNA needed, promoting a deeper and more detailed knowledge of the microbiota present on these dynamic repositories that support microbial life. This will further enable us to perform prospective studies in quarry and applied stone context, monitoring biogenic and nonbiogenic agents, and also to define long-term mitigation strategies to prevent biodegradation\/biodeterioration processes.","194":"Halophilic archaea from the genus Halorubrum possess two extraordinarily diverged archaellin genes, flaB1 and flaB2. To clarify roles for each archaellin, we compared two natural Halorubrum lacusprofundi strains: One of them contains both archaellin genes, and the other has the flaB2 gene only. Both strains synthesize functional archaella; however, the strain, where both archaellins are present, is more motile. In addition, we expressed these archaellins in a Haloferax volcanii strain from which the endogenous archaellin genes were deleted. Three Hfx. volcanii strains expressing Hrr. lacusprofundi archaellins produced functional filaments consisting of only one (FlaB1 or FlaB2) or both (FlaB1\/FlaB2) archaellins. All three strains were motile, although there were profound differences in the efficiency of motility. Both native and recombinant FlaB1\/FlaB2 filaments have greater thermal stability and resistance to low salinity stress than single-component filaments. Functional supercoiled Hrr. lacusprofundi archaella can be composed of either single archaellin: FlaB2 or FlaB1; however, the two divergent archaellin subunits provide additional stabilization to the archaellum structure and thus adaptation to a wider range of external conditions. Comparative genomic analysis suggests that the described combination of divergent archaellins is not restricted to Hrr. lacusprofundi, but is occurring also in organisms from other haloarchaeal genera.","195":"Male and female Plasmodium gametocytes ingested by the Anopheles mosquitoes during a blood meal egress from the red blood cells by rupturing the two surrounding membranes, the parasitophorous vacuole and the red blood cell membranes. Proteins of the so-called osmiophilic bodies, (OBs), secretory organelles resident in the cytoplasm, are important players in this process. Once gametes emerge, the female is ready to be fertilized while the male develops into motile flagellar gametes. Here, we describe the function(s) of PBANKA_1115200, which we named Gamete Egress Protein (GEP), a protein specific to malaria parasites. GEP is restricted to gametocytes, expressed in gametocytes of both genders and partly localizes to the OBs. A mutant lacking the protein shows aberrant rupture of the two surrounding membranes, while OBs discharge is delayed but not aborted. Moreover, we identified a second function of GEP during exflagellation since the axonemes of the male flagellar gametes were not motile. Genetic crossing experiments reveal that both genders are unable to establish infections in mosquitoes and thus the lack of GEP leads to a complete block in Plasmodium transmission from mice to mosquitoes. The combination of our results reveals essential and pleiotropic functions of GEP in Plasmodium gametogenesis.","196":null,"197":null,"198":null,"199":"Phyllosphere and rhizosphere are unique and wide-ranging habitats that harbor various microbial communities, which influence plant growth and health, and the productivity of the ecosystems.

Quantitative PCR showed that the abundances of the microbiome in the soil samples were significantly higher than those in the phyllosphere samples, though there was an extremely low abundance of fungi in bulk soil. High-throughput sequencing showed that the alpha-diversity of bacteria and fungi was higher in the rhizosphere than the phyllosphere samples associated with the same plant, while there was no obvious shift in the alpha-diversity of diazotrophic communities between all the tested phyllosphere and soil samples. Results of the microbial composition showed that sample-specific bacteria and fungi were found among the phyllosphere and rhizosphere of the different host plants. About 10%-27% of bacteria, including diazotrophs, and fungi overlapped between the phyllosphere and the rhizosphere of these host plants. No significant difference in microbial community structure was found among the tested rhizosphere samples, and soil properties had a higher influence on the soil microbial community structures than the host plant species.","200":"The ability of Streptococcus mutans to persist in a variety of adverse environments and to emerge as a numerically dominant member of stable oral biofilm communities are essential elements for its cariogenicity. The S. mutans Cid\/Lrg system has been studied as a key player in the integration of complex environmental signals into regulatory networks that modulate virulence and cell homeostasis. Cid\/Lrg has also been shown to be closely associated with metabolic pathways of this organism, due to distinct patterns of cid and lrg expression in response to growth phase and glucose\/oxygen levels. In this study, a comparison of cid and lrg promoter regions with conserved CodY (a regulator which responds to starvation stress)-binding motifs revealed the presence of a potential CodY-binding site, which is arranged similarly in both cid and lrg promoters. Electrophoretic mobility shift assays (EMSAs) and promoter reporter assays demonstrated that expression of the cid and lrg operons is directly mediated by the global transcriptional regulator CodY. DNase I footprinting analyses confirmed the predicted binding sequences for CodY in both the cid and the lrg promoter regions. Overexpression of CodY had no obvious effect on lrgAB expression, but deficiency of CodY still affected lrgAB expression in a lytST-overexpressing strain, suggesting that CodY is required for the full regulation of lrgAB by LytST. We also demonstrated that both CodY and CcpA are involved in regulating pyruvate flux and utilization. Collectively, these data show that CodY directly regulates cid and lrg expression, and together with CcpA (previously shown to directly regulate cid and lrg promoters) contributes to coordinating pyruvate uptake and utilization in response to both the external environment and the cellular metabolic status.","201":null,"202":"The presence of polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) in marine environments as a result of contamination is an environmental concern, especially in regions where oil spills such as the Deepwater Horizon have occurred.

In this preliminary study, the impacts of these molecules on the community structure of a bacterial consortium isolated from oil-impacted Gulf of Mexico sediment were examined using high-throughput sequencing, demonstrating intriguing negative impacts on species diversity and abundance. While no measurable degradation of the dibenzopyrenes was observed after 28-day incubation, the abundance of known oil-degrading bacteria from orders such as Oceanospirillales, Caulobacterales, Sphingomonadales, and Nitrosococcales were shown to be enhanced.

To overcome the limitations of the cell culture method, we comparatively analyzed the ability of internalization within human MG-63 osteoblasts with imaging flow cytometry (IFC). After evaluation by cell culture assay, the MRSA clones in the study were all able to readily internalize at 3h postinfection, the persistence of intracellular bacteria was evaluated at 24h both by routine cell culture and IFC assay, after vancomycin-BODIPY staining. A statistical difference of persistence was found in ST5-SCCmecII (26.59%), ST228-SCCmecI (20.25%), ST8-SCCmecIV (19.52%), ST239-SCCmecIII (47.82%), and ST22-SCCmecIVh (50.55%) showing the same ability to internalize as ATCC12598 (51%), the invasive isolate used as control strain for invasion and persistence assays. We demonstrated that the intracellular persistence process depends on the total number of infected cells. Comparing our data obtained by IFC with those of the cell culture assay, we obtained greater reproducibility rates and a number of intracellular bacteria, with the advantage of analyzing live host cells. Moreover, with some limitations related to the lack of whole-genome sequencing analysis, we validated the different proclivities to persist in the main Italian HA-MRSA invasive isolates and our results highlighted the heterogeneity of the different clones to persist during cell infection.","207":null,"208":null,"209":"The avian gut microbiota plays an important role in shaping the health of its host.

In this study, we investigated the gut bacterial communities of lesser white-fronted geese (Anser erythropus) wintering at Shengjin Lake and Caizi Lake, China, using high-throughput sequencing (Illumina MiSeq). Altogether, 1,053,624 high-quality sequences and 4,405 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were acquired from 30 fecal samples (15 per lake). The OTUs represented eight phyla and 17 classes from the Caizi Lake samples and seven phyla and 16 classes from the Shengjin Lake samples. Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were the dominant phyla. The spatial distance and the Chao1, Simpson, and Shannon indices showed that the alpha diversity differed significantly between the samples from both lakes. The phylogenetic tree and heatmap analyses showed that all the Caizi Lake samples were clustered together and all the Shengjin Lake samples were clustered together. These findings suggest that diet may be an important driver of gut microbial community structure in the birds from each lake, and the obvious differentiation in their gut microbial structures may indicate that the bacteria are highly sensitive to food sources at both lakes.","210":null,"211":null,"212":"In this paper, we explore how two discrete and geographically separated populations of the lesser long-nosed bat (Leptonycteris yerbabuenae)-one in central and the other in the Pacific region of Mexico-differ in their fecal microbiota composition. Considering the microbiota-host as a unity, in which extrinsic (as food availability and geography) or intrinsic factors (as physiology) play an important role in the microbiota composition, we would expect differentiation in the microbiota of two geographically separated populations. The Amplicon Sequences Variants (ASVs) of the V4 region of the 16s rRNA gene from 68 individuals were analyzed using alpha and beta diversity metrics. We obtained a total of 11 566 (ASVs). The bacterial communities in the Central and Pacific populations had a diversity of 6,939 and 4,088 ASVs, respectively, sharing a core microbiota of 539 ASVs accounting for 75% of the relative abundance, suggesting stability over evolutionary time. The Weighted UniFrac metrics tested by a PERMANOVA showed that lactating and pregnant females had significant beta diversity differences in the two populations compared with other reproductive stages. This could be a consequence of the increased energy requirements of these physiological stages, more than the variation due to geographical separation. In contrast, a positive correlation of the observed ASVs of fecal microbiota with the observed ASVs of plastids related to the diet was observed in the juveniles and adults, suggesting that in these physiological stages an extrinsic factor as the diet shapes the microbiota composition. The results provide a baseline for future studies of the microbiome in these two wild populations of the lesser long-nosed bat, the main pollinator of the Agaves from which the beverages tequila and mezcal are made.","213":null,"214":null,"215":null,"216":null,"217":"Gut microbiota are known to play an important role in health and nutrition of the host and have been attracting an increasing attention.

Despite this rapid development, no studies have addressed the characteristics of their gut microbiota as a potential factor responsible for the improved characteristics. To reveal whether microbiomes of the new lineages are different from indigenous ones, and therefore could be responsible for improved growth features, intestinal microbiota from the new lineages were subjected to high-throughput sequencing. While the phyla Firmicutes, Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria were representing the core bacterial communities that comprised more than 75% in all fish intestinal samples, significant differences were found in the microbial community composition of the new linages versus indigenous fish populations, suggesting the possibility that results in the advantages of enhanced disease resistance and rapid growth for the new fish lineages. Bacterial composition was similar between herbivorous and omnivorous fish. The relative abundance of Bacteroidetes and Actinobacteria was significantly higher in omnivores compared to that of herbivores, whereas Cetobacterium_sp. was abundant in herbivores. We also found that the gut microbiota of freshwater fish in the Dongting lake area was distinct from those of other areas. Network graphs showed the reduced overall connectivity of gut bacteria in indigenous fish, whereas the bacteria of the new fish lineage groups showed hubs with more node degree. A phylogenetic investigation of communities by reconstruction of unobserved states inferred function profile showed several metabolic processes were more active in the new lineages compared to indigenous fish. Our findings suggest that differences in gut bacterial community composition may be an important factor contributing to the rapid growth and high disease resistance of the new fish lineages.","218":"Actinomycetales, such as the genus Streptomyces, are well-known cell factories employed to produce a wide variety of secondary metabolites for industrial use. However, not only is the genetic engineering of Streptomyces more complicated and tedious than other model laboratory species, such as Escherichia coli, there is also a considerable lack of genetic tools, hindering its adoption as a common chassis for synthetic biology. In this work, 23 novel shuttle vectors are presented that follow the canonical SEVA (Standard European Vector Architecture) common architecture with the goal of increasing the genetic toolbox repertoire for Streptomyces and other actinomycetes. The ORI module of these plasmids is composed of the combination of two origins of replication, one for Gram-negative bacteria and the other for Streptomyces, a Gram-positive bacteria. Origins of replication have been included in the collection for integrative, low-copy number, and medium-to-high-copy number vectors for Streptomyces. Also, a new selection marker has been developed that confers resistance to apramycin. The functionality of these plasmids was tested via the heterologous expression of GFP and the heterologous production of the plant flavonoid apigenin in Streptomyces albus J1074, with successful results in both cases, therefore expanding the current repertoire of genetic manipulation tools in Streptomyces species.","219":null,"220":"With the emergence of large-scale epidemiologic human microbiome studies, there is a need to understand the reproducibility of microbial DNA sequencing and the impact of specimen collection and processing methods on measures of microbial community composition and structure, with reproducibility studies in infants and young children particularly lacking.

We detected no evidence of batch effects in replicate DNA samples or extractions from the same stool sample. Variability in DNA yield and alpha diversity was observed between the different collection, handling, and processing protocols. However, across all protocols, subject variability was the dominant contributor to microbiome structure, with comparatively little impact of the protocol used. While collection method and DNA extraction kit may affect DNA yield, and correspondingly alpha diversity, our findings suggest that characterization of the structure and composition of the fecal microbiome of infants and young children are reliably measurable by standardized collection, handling, and processing protocols and DNA extraction methods within an individual longitudinal study.","221":null,"222":"Interactions between gut microbiota not only regulate physical health, but also form a vital bridge between the environment and the host, thus helping the host to better adapt to the environment.

The reasons for observed differences were discussed. The results showed that the dominant phyla of the kiang were Bacteroidetes and Firmicutes, and the structure and abundance of the gut microbiota differed significantly between seasons and environments. However, the relatively stable function of the gut microbiota supplies the host with increased adaptability to the environment.

Despite this importance, bacterial communities remain vastly understudied in many groups of invertebrates, including mites. Quill mites (Acariformes: Syringophilidae) are a poorly known group of permanent bird ectoparasites that occupy quills of feathers and feed on bird subcutaneous tissue and fluids. Most of the known species have strongly female-biased sex ratio, and it was hypothesized that this is caused by endosymbiotic bacteria. Previously, Anaplasma phagocytophilum (Foggie) and a high diversity of Wolbachia strains were detected in quill mites via targeted PCR screens. Here, we use an unbiased 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing approach to determine other bacteria that potentially impact quill mite biology. We performed 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing of 126 quill mite individuals from eleven species parasitizing twelve species (four families) of passeriform birds. In addition to Wolbachia, we found Spiroplasma as potential symbiont of quill mites. Consistently, high Spiroplasma titers were only found in individuals of two mite species associated with finches of the genus Carduelis, suggesting a history of horizontal transfers of Spiroplasma via the bird host. Furthermore, there was evidence for Spiroplasma negatively affecting Wolbachia titers. We found no evidence for the previously reported Anaplasma in quill mites, but detected sequences of high similarity to the potential pathogens Brucella and Bartonella at low abundances. Other amplicon sequence variants (ASVs) could be assigned to a diverse number of bacterial taxa, including several that were previously isolated from bird skin. Further, many frequently found ASVs were assigned to taxa that show a very broad distribution with no strong prior evidence for symbiotic association with animals. We interpret these findings as evidence for a scarcity of resident microbial associates (other than inherited symbionts) in quill mites.

This study investigated the presence, abundance, and activity of these groups of microbes at a beach near Springmaid Pier in Myrtle Beach, South Carolina, through the implementation of next generation sequencing, quantitative PCR (qPCR), and microcosm experiments to monitor activity. Sequencing analysis revealed a diverse community of ammonia-oxidizing microbes dominated by AOA classified within the family Nitrosopumilaceae, and qPCR revealed the abundance of AOA amoA genes over AOB by at least an order of magnitude in most samples. Microcosm studies indicate that the rates of potential ammonia oxidation in these communities satisfy Michaelis-Menten substrate kinetics and this process is more active at temperatures corresponding to summer months than winter. Potential rates in AOA medium were higher than that of AOB medium, indicating a potentially greater contribution of AOA to this process in this environment. In conclusion, this study provides further evidence of the dominance of AOA in these environments compared with AOB and highlights the overall efficiency of this process at turning over excess ammonium that may be present in these environments.","227":"A reusable water bottle was swabbed as part of the citizen science project \"Swab and Send,\" and a Klebsiella grimontii isolate was recovered on chromogenic agar and designated SS141.

The genome also contains the antibiotic-resistant genes, blaOXY-6-4 , and a variant of fosA, which is likely to explain the observed resistance to ampicillin, amoxicillin, and fosfomycin. We have also shown that SS141 forms biofilms on both polystyrene and polypropylene surfaces, providing a reasonable explanation for its ability to colonize a reusable water bottle.

It is generally accepted that bacteria contribute significantly to DMSP turnover. We show that the other low molecular weight zwitterionic dimethylsulfonio compounds dimethylsulfonioacetate (DMSA) and gonyol are also widely distributed in phytoplankton and can serve as alternative substrates for volatile production. DMSA was found in 11 of the 16 surveyed phytoplankton species, and gonyol was detected in all haptophytes and dinoflagellates. These prevalent zwitterions are also metabolized by marine bacteria. The patterns of bacterial MeSH and DMS release were dependent on the zwitterions present. Certain bacteria metabolize DMSA and gonyol and release MeSH, in others gonyol inhibited DMS-producing enzymes. If added in addition to DMSP, gonyol entirely inhibited the formation of volatiles in Ruegeria pomeroyi. In contrast, no substantial effect of this compound was observed in the DMSP metabolism of Halomonas sp.

Moreover, no transposon (Tn) mutagenesis tool has been validated for use in Mk, a situation limiting the repertoire of genetic approaches available to accelerate the dissection of gene function and the generation of gene knockout mutants in this poorly characterized pathogen. In this study, we validated the functionality of a powerful Tn mutagenesis tool in Mk and used this tool in conjunction with a forward genetic screen to establish a previously unrecognized role of a conserved mycobacterial small RNA gene of unknown function in colony morphology features and biofilm formation. We also combined Tn mutagenesis with next-generation sequencing to identify 12,071 Tn insertions that do not compromise viability in vitro.

However, in the absence of selection, large plasmids can be lost due to the fitness costs associated with harboring these genetic elements. pC02 is a previously identified multidrug resistance, conjugative plasmid that is found in S. aureus. In addition to antibiotic resistance, pC02 also carries genes known to be associated with antiseptic resistance. Among these, we previously characterized the contribution of qacA to pC02 mediated reduced chlorhexidine susceptibility. Herein, we demonstrate that pC02 also mediates triclosan resistance, likely due to the presence of fabI, a known triclosan resistance gene. Moreover, we demonstrate that conjugative transfer of pC02 increases triclosan resistance in recipient cells. Competition assays demonstrated a fitness cost associated with carriage of the large pC02 plasmid. However, subinhibitory concentrations of either chlorhexidine or triclosan abrogated this fitness cost. Given the widespread use of these antiseptics, both of which accumulate in wastewater and other environmental reservoirs, indiscriminate use of antiseptics likely imposes a constant selective pressure that promotes maintenance of antimicrobial resistance factors within S. aureus.","239":null,"240":null,"241":null,"242":"Bacteria forming biofilms on surgical implants is a problem that might be alleviated by the use of antibacterial coatings. In this article, recombinant spider silk was functionalized with the peptidoglycan degrading endolysin SAL-1 from the staphylococcal bacteriophage SAP-1 and the biofilm-matrix-degrading enzyme Dispersin B from Aggregatibacter actinomycetemcomitans using direct genetic fusion and\/or covalent protein-protein fusion catalyzed by Sortase A. Spider silk assembly and enzyme immobilization was monitored using quartz crystal microbalance analysis. Enzyme activity was investigated both with a biochemical assay using cleavage of fluorescent substrate analogues and bacterial assays for biofilm degradation and turbidity reduction. Spider silk coatings functionalized with SAL-1 and Disperin B were found to exhibit bacteriolytic effect and inhibit biofilm formation, respectively. The strategy to immobilize antibacterial enzymes to spider silk presented herein show potential to be used as surface coatings of surgical implants and other medical equipment to avoid bacterial colonization.","243":null,"244":null,"245":null,"246":null,"247":null,"248":"Bacterial chromosome segregation is an essential cellular process that is particularly elusive in spherical bacteria such as the opportunistic human pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. In this study, we examined the functional significance of a ParB homologue, Spo0J, in staphylococcal chromosome segregation and investigated the role of the structural maintenance of chromosomes (SMC) bacterial condensin in this process. We show that neither spo0J nor smc is essential in S. aureus; however, their absence causes abnormal chromosome segregation. We demonstrate that formation of complexes containing Spo0J and SMC is required for efficient S. aureus chromosome segregation and that SMC localization is dependent on Spo0J. Furthermore, we found that cell division and cell cycle progression are unaffected by the absence of spo0J or smc. Our results verify the role of Spo0J and SMC in ensuring accurate staphylococcal chromosome segregation and also imply functional redundancy or the involvement of additional mechanisms that might contribute to faithful chromosome inheritance.","249":null,"250":null,"251":"This rapid high resolution melting (HRM) assay allows distinguishing between Streptococcus suis serotype pairs 2 and 1\/2 as well as 1 and 14, respectively, based on a single-nucleotide polymorphism within capsular polysaccharide synthesis gene cluster K.

However, genes that cannot be cloned in bacteria do not necessarily exert toxic effects on the final host. In order to tackle this issue, we adapted two DNA assembly workflows for rapid, cloning-free construction and genomic integration of expression cassettes in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. One method is based on a modified Gibson assembly, while the other relies on a direct assembly and integration of linear PCR products by yeast homologous recombination. The methods require few simple experimental steps, and their performance was evaluated for the assembly and integration of unclonable zeaxanthin epoxidase expression cassettes in yeast. Results showed that up to 95% integration efficiency can be reached with minimal experimental effort. The presented workflows can be employed as rapid gene integration tools for yeast, especially tailored for integrating unclonable genes.","254":"The enzyme urease is widespread in nature and catalyzes the hydrolysis of urea to form ammonia and carbonic acid. The high proficiency of the enzyme is associated with a wide range of societal challenges. In agriculture, bacterial urease activity leads to loss of fertilizer through NH3 emission, which has a negative impact on the environment and human health. Urease is also an essential virulence factor for several pathogenic bacteria. To screen for potential urease inhibitors, efficient, sensitive, and accurate urease activity assays are needed. However, most urease activity assays are labor-intensive and become time-consuming when used to screen multiple samples. Based on systematic optimization, we have developed a urea-containing growth medium and method for continuous real-time monitoring and screening of urease activity from both bacterial cells and pure urease in a plate reader setup. The defined M9-based urea (M9U) medium was found to be more sensitive and suitable for a plate reader setup than both Christensen's urea broth (CUB) and Stuart's urea broth (SUB), which are established and well-known complex urea media that formed the principle foundation of M9U. Furthermore, we show that urease activity measurements using the M9U medium in our plate reader-based method allow reliable high-throughput screening of urease inhibitors.","255":null,"256":null,"257":"This case study aims to describe the adoption of an innovative flow cytometer (i.e., UF-5000), which can support the microbiologists' process of diagnosing suspected urinary tract infections (UTIs).

However, the structure and functions of microbiome have not been clarified during the tobacco aging process. In this study, 16S rDNA and ITS amplicon sequencing techniques were used to analyze the core microbiome of 15 tobacco samples from five different aging stages. The whole bacterial microbiome was classified into 29 microbial phyla and 132 orders. Enterobacteriales (63%), Pseudomonadales (16%), Sphingomonadales (8%), Xanthomonadales (4%), Burkholderiales (4%), Rhizobiales (3%), and Bacillales (2%) comprised the core bacterial microbiome. The whole fungal microbiome was classified into five microbial phyla and 52 orders. Incertae_sedis_Eurotiomycetes (27%), Wallemiales (25%), Sporidiobolales (17%), Capnodiales (5%), Eurotiales (2%), an unclassified Ascomycota (12%), and an unidentified Eurotiomycetes (4%) comprised the core fungal microbiome. FAPROTAX function prediction suggested that the core microbiome has a substantial potential for the carbon cycle, nitrate metabolism, aromatic compound degradation, chitinolysis, cellulolysis, and xylanolysis, but simultaneously, the core microbiome is also a source of human pathogens. The dynamics of the bacterial community were primarily determined by the total nitrogen in tobacco leaves during the aging process, while those of the fungal microbiome were primarily determined by total organic carbon. This study indicated that the core microbiome activities may play an important role in regulating the loss of carbon organic compounds and enhancing the secondary metabolites during tobacco leaves aging process.","260":"Hematological malignancies are the most common type of pediatric cancers, and acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL) is the most frequently occurring hematological malignancy during childhood. A major cause of mortality in leukemia is bloodstream infection (BSI). The aim of the current study was to explore the gut microbiota in ALL and its potential functional alterations. High-throughput sequencing was used to characterize the bacterial and fungal microbiota in feces and their predicted functional characteristics in a xenotransplant pediatric ALL mouse model. Our work shows that gut microbiota significantly changes in leukemia, which may result in functional alterations. This study may provide potential therapeutic or preventive strategies of BSI in ALL.","261":"The gut microbiota plays an important role in animal health and is strongly affected by the environment. Captivity and human source food have been shown to influence drastically the gut microbiota composition and function of wild animals. Therefore, in the present study, the gut microbiota of provisioned and wild populations of limestone-living rhesus macaques (Macaca mulatta) were compared using high-throughput 16S rRNA sequencing and bioinformatic analyses. The results indicated that provisioned macaques had a higher microbial richness than wild macaques, but there was no significant difference in the evenness of the gut microbiota between the two populations. Provisioned macaques also showed a higher abundance of Firmicutes and a lower abundance of Bacteroidetes than wild macaques. Functional analysis revealed that wild macaques had enriched microbial pathways involved in glycan biosynthesis and metabolism, transport and catabolism, and the digestive and endocrine systems, while provisioned macaques were richer in pathways associated with signaling molecules and interaction, neurodegenerative diseases. These differences were likely due to modification of the gut microbiota of the provisioned macaques to enable the digestion of new foods.","262":null,"263":null,"264":"Fermentation, also known as aging, is vital for enhancing the quality of flue-cured tobacco leaves (FTLs). Aged FTLs demonstrate high-quality sensory characteristics, while unaged FTLs do not. Microbes play important roles in the FTL fermentation process. However, the eukaryotic microbial community diversity is poorly understood, as are microbial associations within FTLs. We aimed to characterize and compare the microbiota associated with two important categories, fresh and strong flavor style FTLs, and to reveal correlations between the microbial taxa within them. Based on 16S and 18S rRNA Illumina MiSeq sequencing, the community richness and diversity of prokaryotes were almost as high as that of eukaryotes. The dominant microbes of FTLs belonged to seven genera, including Pseudomonas, Bacillus, Methylobacterium, Acinetobacter, Sphingomonas, Neophaeosphaeria, and Cladosporium, of the Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, and Ascomycota phyla. According to partial least square discriminant analysis (PLS-DA), Xanthomonas, Franconibacter, Massilia, Quadrisphaera, Staphylococcus, Cladosporium, Lodderomyces, Symmetrospora, Golovinomyces, and Dioszegia were significantly positively correlated with fresh flavor style FTLs, while Xenophilus, Fusarium, unclassified Ustilaginaceae, Tilletiopsis, Cryphonectria, Colletotrichum, and Cyanodermella were significantly positively correlated with strong flavor style FTLs. Network analysis identified seven hubs, Aureimonas, Kocuria, Massilia, Brachybacterium, Clostridium, Dietzia, and Vishniacozyma, that may play important roles in FTL ecosystem stability, which may be destroyed by Myrmecridium. FTL microbiota was found to be correlated with flavor style. Species present in lower numbers than the dominant microbes might be used as microbial markers to discriminate different flavor style samples and to stabilize FTL microbial communities. This research advances our understanding of FTL microbiota and describes a means of discriminating between fresh and strong flavor FTLs based on their respective stable microbiota.","265":null,"266":"Candida albicans is an opportunist pathogen responsible for a large spectrum of infections, from superficial mycosis to systemic diseases known as candidiasis. Its ability to grow in different morphological forms, such as yeasts or filamentous hyphae, contributes to its survival in diverse microenvironments. Iron uptake has been associated with virulence, and C. albicans has developed elaborate strategies for acquiring iron from its host. In this work, we analyze the metabolic changes in response to changes in iron content in the growth medium and compare C. albicans adaptation to the presence or absence of iron. Functional and morphological studies, correlated to a quantitative proteomic analysis, were performed to assess the specific pathways underlying the response to iron, both in the yeast and filamentous forms. Overall, the results show that the adaptive response to iron is associated with a metabolic remodeling affecting the energetic pathways of the pathogen. This includes changes in the thiol-dependent redox status, the activity of key mitochondrial enzymes and the respiratory chain. Iron deficiency stimulates bioenergetic pathways, whereas iron-rich condition is associated with greater biosynthetic needs, particularly in filamentous forms. Moreover, we found that C. albicans yeast cells have an extraordinary capability to adapt to changes in environmental conditions.","267":"Lake anchovy (Coilia ectenes taihuensis) is a sedentary, dominant fish species that forms an unmanaged fishery in Taihu Lake, eastern China. The environment and developmental stage of lake anchovy are likely important drivers of their gut microbiome, which is linked to host health and development. To investigate the relationship between the gut microbiome and three defined factors (fish sex, fish body size, and the local habitat), high-throughput sequencing of the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was used to study the microorganisms of 184 fish samples and four water samples collected in Taihu Lake. Four dominant bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, and Cyanobacteria) were present in all fish samples. We compared the microbial communities of males and females and found that the relative abundance of Corynebacteriaceae was significantly higher in males than in females, while the opposite trend was detected for Sphingomonadaceae. We also discovered that the relative abundance of Firmicutes was positively correlated with fish body size and that the proportions of Proteobacteria and Tenericutes were lower in larger fish than in fish of other sizes. Finally, we found that the difference in microbial richness between eastern and northern Taihu Lake was the most marked. Lake anchovy was rich in Lactobacillus and Clostridium in the eastern site, while those in the northern site had the highest abundance of Sphingomonas and Methylobacterium, suggesting that the local habitat may also influence the intestinal microbiome. These findings will not only help researchers understand the community composition of the intestinal microflora of lake anchovy but also contribute to the protection of fish resources in Lake Taihu and the sustainable use of lake anchovy.","268":null,"269":null,"270":null,"271":"Probiotic bacteria are frequently used to treat intestinal diseases or to improve health; however, little is known about the evolutionary changes of these bacteria during probiotic manufacture and the bacterial ability to colonize the intestine.

In this study, a strain of Lactobacillus reuteri was isolated from mouse duodenum and subjected to 150 serial passes in milk to simulate the industrial propagation of probiotic bacteria. The strains adapted to milk outperformed their ancestor when grown in milk; we also showed evidence of reduced intestinal colonization of milk-adapted strains. Whole-genome sequencing showed that bacterial adaptation to milk selects mutants with altered metabolic functions.","272":"The Leishmania lysosome has an atypical structure, consisting of an elongated vesicle-filled tubule running along the anterior-posterior axis of the cell, which is termed the multivesicular tubule (MVT) lysosome. Alongside, the MVT lysosome is one or more microtubules, the lysosomal microtubule(s). Previous work indicated there were cell cycle-related changes in MVT lysosome organization; however, these only provided snapshots and did not connect the changes in the lysosomal microtubule(s) or lysosomal function. Using mNeonGreen tagged cysteine peptidase A and SPEF1 as markers of the MVT lysosome and lysosomal microtubule(s), we examined the dynamics of these structures through the cell cycle. Both the MVT lysosome and lysosomal microtubule(s) elongated at the beginning of the cell cycle before plateauing and then disassembling in late G2 before cytokinesis. Moreover, the endocytic rate in cells where the MVT lysosome and lysosomal microtubule(s) had disassembled was extremely low. The dynamic nature of the MVT lysosome and lysosomal microtubule(s) parallels that of the Trypanosoma cruzi cytostome\/cytopharynx, which also has a similar membrane tubule structure with associated microtubules. As the cytostome\/cytopharynx is an ancestral feature of the kinetoplastids, this suggests that the Leishmania MVT lysosome and lysosomal microtubule(s) are a reduced cytostome\/cytopharynx-like feature.","273":null,"274":"The intraspecies genomic diversity of the single-strand RNA (+) virus species hepatitis A virus (Hepatovirus), hepatitis C virus (Hepacivirus), and hepatitis E virus (Orthohepevirus) was compared. These viral species all can cause liver inflammation (hepatitis), but share no gene similarity. The codon usage of human hepatitis A virus (HAV) is suboptimal for replication in its host, a characteristic it shares with taxonomically related rodent, simian, and bat hepatitis A virus species. We found this codon usage to be strikingly similar to that of Triatoma virus that infects blood-sucking kissing bugs. The codon usage of that virus is well adapted to its insect host. The codon usage of HAV is also similar to other invertebrate viruses of various taxonomic families. An evolutionary ancestor of HAV and related virus species is hypothesized to be an insect virus that underwent a host jump to infect mammals. The similarity between HAV and invertebrate viruses goes beyond codon usage, as they also share amino acid composition characteristics, while not sharing direct sequence homology. In contrast, hepatitis C virus and hepatitis E virus are highly similar in codon usage preference, nucleotide composition, and amino acid composition, and share these characteristics with Human pegivirus A, West Nile virus, and Zika virus. We present evidence that these observations are only partly explained by differences in nucleotide composition of the complete viral codon regions. We consider the combination of nucleotide composition, amino acid composition, and codon usage preference suitable to provide information on possible evolutionary similarities between distant virus species that cannot be investigated by phylogeny.","275":null,"276":null,"277":"Infectious diseases still stand as a major cause of morbidity and mortality, and this problem can be worsened with the current antimicrobial resistance crisis.

Therefore, we collected samples of solid, liquid, dorsal, and ventral epithelium fractions from five female yaks, then amplified bacterial 16S rRNA gene V4 regions and sequenced them using an Illumina MiSeq platform. Principal coordinates analysis detected significant differences in bacterial communities between the liquid, solid, and epithelium fractions, and between dorsal and ventral epithelium fractions. Rikenellaceae RC9, the families Lachnospiraceae and Ruminococcaceae, and Fibrobacter spp. were the abundant and enriched bacteria in solid fraction, while the genera Prevotella and Prevotellaceae UCG 003 were higher in the liquid fraction. Campylobacter spp., Comamonas spp., Desulfovibrio spp., and Solobacterium spp. were significantly higher in dorsal epithelium, while Howardella spp., Prevotellaceae UCG 001, Ruminococcaceae UCG 005, and Treponema 2 were enriched in the ventral epithelium. Comparison of predictive functional profiles among the solid, liquid, and dorsal, and ventral epithelium fractions also revealed significant differences. Microbiota in the ventral fraction of yak rumen also significantly differ from reported microbiota of cattle.

However, the establishment of microalgal and bacterial communities is poorly understood during coral ontogeny in the wild. We examined the establishment and co-occurrence between multiple microbial communities using 16S rRNA (bacterial) and ITS2 rDNA (Symbiodiniaceae) gene amplicon sequencing in juveniles of the common coral, Acropora tenuis, across the first year of development. Symbiodiniaceae communities in juveniles were dominated by Durusdinium trenchii and glynnii (D1 and D1a), with lower abundances of Cladocopium (C1, C1d, C50, and Cspc). Bacterial communities were more diverse and dominated by taxa within Proteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, and Planctomycetes. Both communities were characterized by significant changes in relative abundance and diversity of taxa throughout the year. D1, D1a, and C1 were significantly correlated with multiple bacterial taxa, including Alpha-, Deltra-, and Gammaproteobacteria, Planctomycetacia, Oxyphotobacteria, Phycisphaerae, and Rhizobiales. Specifically, D1a tended to associate with Oxyphotobacteria and D1 with Alphaproteobacteria, although these associations may represent correlational and not causal relationships. Bioenergetic modeling combined with physiological measurements of coral juveniles (surface area and Symbiodiniaceae cell densities) identified key periods of carbon limitation and nitrogen assimilation, potentially coinciding with shifts in microbial community composition. These results demonstrate that Symbiodiniaceae and bacterial communities are dynamic throughout the first year of ontology and may vary in tandem, with important fitness effects on host juveniles.","283":"The two-peptide bacteriocins produced by Gram-positive bacteria require two different peptides, present in equimolar amounts, to elicit optimal antimicrobial activity. Producer organisms are protected from their bacteriocin by a dedicated immunity protein. The immunity proteins for two-peptide bacteriocins contain putative transmembrane domains (TMDs) and might therefore be associated with the membrane. The immunity protein CbnZ for the two-peptide bacteriocin carnobacteriocin XY (CbnXY) was identified by heterologously expressing the cbnZ gene in sensitive host strains. Using protein topology prediction methods and the dual pho-lac reporter system, we mapped out the membrane topology of CbnZ, along with those of the immunity proteins LagC and LciM for the two-peptide bacteriocins lactococcin G and lactococcin MN, respectively.

Here, we used the water avoidance stress (WAS) test in mouse models for chronic stress-induced gastritis to investigate the underlying mechanisms of this disease. The effect of stress on the gastric microbiota was analyzed based on 16S rRNA sequencing; the changes in hydrogen sulfide (H2 S) and inflammatory cytokine levels in gastric tissues were detected by Western blotting, ELISA, immunofluorescence, and qRT-PCR. Hematoxylin and eosin staining was used as an indicator of the gastritis histological score. This finding is consistent with previous studies showing that gastric H2 S is negatively associated with the inflammatory index and might protect the gastrointestinal tract from inflammation. WAS-induced gastritis was associated with a reduction in H2 S release, which appeared to affect the homeostasis of the gastric microbiota of mice. Inflammation and microbial dysbiosis were partially reversed by sodium hydrosulfide (NaHS) and vitamin B6 (VB6) supplementation, suggesting the therapeutic potential of VB6 supplementation for the treatment of stress-induced gastritis.

However, conjugation is the only applicable method for the transformation of marine purple photosynthetic bacteria so far. Here, we examined a calcium chloride-mediated method for the transformation of marine purple photosynthetic bacteria. Plasmid DNAs containing the kanamycin resistance gene were successfully transferred into chemically competent cells of two strains of marine purple photosynthetic bacteria (Rhodovulum sulfidophilum and Roseospira marina). Heat shock treatment increased the transformation efficiency in R. sulfidophilum, whereas the addition of cell-penetrating peptide did not improve it. We also found that prolonged incubation in agar plates containing kanamycin led to spontaneous mutation of the 16S rRNA, resulting in kanamycin resistance in R. marina.

Here, we report new genome sequences for four species, three of them are reported for the first time, namely Acetobacterium paludosum DSM 8237, Acetobacterium tundrae DSM 917, Acetobacterium bakii DSM 8239, and Alkalibaculum bacchi DSM 221123. We performed a comparative genomic analysis focused on the WL pathway's genes and their encoded proteins, using Acetobacterium woodii as a reference genome. The Average Nucleotide Identity (ANI) values ranged from 70% to 95% over an alignment length of 5.4-6.5 Mbp. The core genome consisted of 363 genes, whereas the number of unique genes in a single genome ranged from 486 in A. tundrae to 2360 in A.bacchi. No significant rearrangements were detected in the gene order for the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway however, two species showed variations in genes involved in formate metabolism: A. paludosum harbor two copies of fhs1, and A. bakii a truncated fdhF1. The analysis of protein networks highlighted the expansion of protein orthologues in A. woodii compared to A. bacchi, whereas protein networks involved in the WL pathway were more conserved.

We used two large datasets published by the American Gut Project (AGP) and a gut metagenomic dataset (NBT) to analyze the relationship between these two genera and the community structure of the gut microbiota. The meta-analysis showed that Bifidobacterium, but not Lactobacillus, is among the dominant genera in the human gut microbiota. The relative abundance of Bifidobacterium was elevated when Lactobacillus was present. Moreover, these two genera showed a positive correlation with some butyrate producers among the dominant genera, and both were associated with alpha diversity, beta diversity, and the robustness of the gut microbiota. Additionally, samples harboring Bifidobacterium present but no Lactobacillus showed higher alpha diversity and were more robust than those only carrying Lactobacillus. Further comparisons with other genera validated the important role of Bifidobacterium in the gut microbiota robustness. Multivariate analysis of 11,744 samples from the AGP dataset suggested Bifidobacterium to be associated with demographic features, lifestyle, and disease. In summary, Bifidobacterium members, which are promoted by dairy and whole-grain consumption, are more important than Lactobacillus in maintaining the diversity and robustness of the gut microbiota.","302":"Enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) infection causes a histopathological lesion including recruitment of F-actin beneath the attached bacteria and formation of actin-rich pedestal-like structures. Another important target of EPEC is the tight junction (TJ), and EspF induces displacement of TJ proteins and increased intestinal permeability. Previously, we determined that an EPEC strain lacking EspF did not cause TJ disruption; meanwhile, pedestals were located on the TJ and smaller than those induced by the wild-type strain. Therefore, EspF could be playing an important role in both phenotypes. Here, using different cell models, we found that EspF was essential for pedestal maturation through ZO-1 disassembly from TJ, leading to (a) ZO-1 recruitment to the pedestal structure; no other main TJ proteins were required. Recruited ZO-1 allowed the afadin recruitment. (b) Afadin recruitment caused an afadin-ZO-1 transient interaction, like during TJ formation. (c) Afadin and ZO-1 were segregated to the tip and the stem of pedestal, respectively, causing pedestal maturation. Initiation of these three discrete phases for pedestal maturation functionally and physically required EspF expression. Pedestal maturation process could help coordinate the epithelial actomyosin function by maintaining the actin-rich column composing the pedestal structure and could be important in the dynamics of the pedestal movement on epithelial cells.","303":null,"304":null,"305":null,"306":null,"307":null,"308":null,"309":null,"310":null,"311":null,"312":null,"313":null,"314":"The genus Laceyella consists of a thermophilic filamentous bacteria.

To that end, the endophytic communities were assessed by plating and Illumina-based 16S rRNA gene amplicon sequencing. Two hundred and four cultivable bacterial strains were successfully isolated. From the plant's RS, the isolated strains were identified mainly as belonging to the genera Sphingomonas, Curtobacterium, and Methylobacterium, whereas Bacillus was the dominant genus isolated from the vegetative stage (VS). From a total of 133,399 sequences obtained from Illumina-based sequencing, a subset of 25,092 was classified in operational taxonomy units (OTUs). Four hundred and sixteen OTUs were obtained from the VS and 66 from the RS. In the VS, the most abundant families were Pseudoalteromonadaceae and Alicyclobacillaceae, while in the RS, Enterobacteriaceae and Bacillaceae were the most abundant families.

For instance, pome fruits such as apple and pear are highly dependent on pollination for fruit set, fruit quality, and yield. Nectar is often inhabited by microbes, most often yeasts and bacteria, which may change nectar quality and therefore also affect plant-pollinator interactions. Here, we used high-throughput 16S ribosomal RNA gene amplicon sequencing to investigate the temporal and spatial variation in bacterial communities in floral nectar of apple and pear. We sampled 15 apple (Malus x domestica Borkh.) and 15 pear (Pyrus communis L.) orchards distributed over the eastern part of Belgium over a timespan of seven days. Nectar bacterial community composition differed strongly among fruit species. Nectar of pear was dominated by Actinobacteria, followed by Proteobacteria and Firmicutes. Apple nectar was strongly enriched in Bacteroidetes, a phylum which until now has been found to be rarely associated with floral nectar. Nectar was dominated by only a few bacterial species, with Brevibacterium (Actinobacteria) and Undibacterium (Proteobacteria) as the most abundant bacteria in pear and apple nectar, respectively. Bacterial richness and diversity were found to fluctuate during flowering, likely due to changing environmental conditions. Additionally, spatial structure in nectar bacterial community composition was found in apple orchards, while this was not the case for pear. Differences in nectar bacterial communities between apple and pear nectar may differently affect the chemical and nutritional composition of the nectar, influencing pollinator attraction and visitation, and thus pollination efficacy in general.","322":null,"323":null,"324":null,"325":null,"326":null,"327":null,"328":null,"329":"","330":null,"331":null,"332":null,"333":"The histamine H2 receptor (H2R) is a G protein-coupled receptor that mediates cyclic AMP production, protein kinase A activation, and MAP kinase signaling. In order to explore the multifaceted effects of histamine signaling on immune cells, phagocytosis was evaluated using primary mouse-derived macrophages. Phagocytosis is initiated by signaling via surface-bound scavenger receptors and can be regulated by autophagy. Absence of H2R signaling resulted in diminished phagocytosis of live bacteria and synthetic microspheres by primary macrophages from histamine H2 receptor gene (Hrh2)-deficient mice. Flow cytometry and immunofluorescence microscopy were used to quantify phagocytosis of phylogenetically diverse bacteria as well as microspheres of defined chemical composition. Autophagy and scavenger receptor gene expression were quantified in macrophages after exposure to Escherichia coli. Expression of the autophagy genes, Becn1 and Atg12, was increased in Hrh2-\/- macrophages, indicating upregulation of autophagy pathways. Expression of the Macrophage Scavenger Receptor 1 gene (Msr1) was diminished in Hrh2-deficient macrophages, supporting the possible importance of histamine signaling in scavenger receptor abundance and macrophage function. Flow cytometry confirmed diminished MSR1 surface abundance in Hrh2-\/- macrophages. These data suggest that H2R signaling is required for effective phagocytosis by regulating the process of autophagy and scavenger receptor MSR1 abundance in macrophages.","334":null,"335":null,"336":"The presence of multidrug-resistant bacteria like methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) in retail meat is one of the current concerns of the public health authorities. Bacterial cross-contamination and recontamination during household food preparation could play an important role in the dissemination of such bacteria, and therefore could contribute to a serious health problem, more specifically for immunocompromised people. In order to evaluate the importance of such events, a probabilistic model was developed to estimate the likelihood and extent of cross-contamination and recontamination and the burden of MRSA from contaminated raw chicken meat via hands and kitchen utensils in a serving (consisting on a slice of bread and a piece of grilled chicken meat) during a household barbecue in Germany. A modular design was used, taking into account the chronological order of the routines during the barbecue event, and Monte Carlo simulations were applied. Available data on the prevalence and burden of MRSA in chicken meat at retail in Germany were used as starting point and were incorporated in the model as probability distributions. The probabilities and extent of bacterial transfer between food items and kitchen utensils (referred to as \"Objects\") and the routines performed during food preparation (referred to as \"Actions\") specified by their probabilities of occurrence were incorporated as the main input parameters. The model was set up in R 3.5.0 and converted to a standardized format (FSKX file). Therefore, the code can be easily accessed, evaluated, modified, and reused for different purposes. The present study contributes to the quantification of consumer exposure to MRSA through food consumption once contaminated food has entered the household kitchen. Even when the MRSA prevalence and bacterial load in retail chicken meat in Germany are low, resistant bacteria can reach the consumer due to cross-contamination and recontamination events. The results show that the probability of one CFU to be transferred from the contaminated raw chicken meat to the final serving and the number of MRSA bacteria transferred due to cross-contamination and recontamination events are in general low, being the contamination of the final serving more likely to occur via bread, rather than via grilled chicken. The results show that the prevalence of MRSA at retail highly influences the probability of the final serving to be contaminated. However, this study also highlights the importance of keeping good hygiene practices during the household food manipulation for reducing the spread of MRSA. The provision of the model in a standardized data format will allow an easy incorporation of the developed model into a complete quantitative microbial risk assessment model that will greatly help to estimate the risk of consumer exposure to MRSA through the consumption of contaminated food.","337":"Marine Vibrio members are of great interest for both ecological and biotechnological research, which often relies on their isolation. Whereas many efforts have been made for the detection of food-borne pathogenic species, much less is known about the performances of standard culture media toward environmental vibrios. We show that the isolation\/enumeration of marine vibrios using thiosulfate-citrate-bile salts-sucrose agar (TCBS) as selective medium may be hampered by the variable adaptability of different taxa to the medium, which may result even in isolation failure and\/or in substantial total count underestimation. We propose a modified TCBS as isolation medium, adjusted for marine vibrios requirements, which greatly improved their recovery in dilution plate counts, compared with the standard medium. The modified medium offers substantial advantages over TCBS, providing more accurate and likely estimations of the actual presence of vibrios. Modified TCBS allowed the recovery of otherwise undetected vibrios, some of which producing biotechnologically valuable enzymes, thus expanding the isolation power toward potentially new enzyme-producers Vibrio taxa. Moreover, we report a newly designed Vibrio-specific PCR primers pair, targeting a unique rpoD sequence, useful for rapid confirmation of isolates as Vibrio members and subsequent genetic analyses.","338":null,"339":null,"340":"The Gram-negative pathogen Vibrio vulnificus produces several iron-sequestration systems including a hemin uptake system in response to iron limitation as a means to acquire this essential element. Strains of this organism are capable of causing serious septicemia in humans and eels, where hemin is abundant and an advantageous source of iron. Vibrio vulnificus hemin uptake systems consist of HupA, a well studied outer membrane protein, and a recently identified HvtA protein receptor. In this study, we confirmed that the expression of the hvtA gene is iron-regulated in a fur-dependent manner. When analyzed for virulence in a hemin-overloaded murine model system, the hupA gene was more important for establishing infection than the hvtA gene. Transcriptional profiling of these genes using strains of two different biotypes, biotype 1 (human pathogen) and biotype 2 (eel pathogen), showed that the expression of the two receptors was also regulated in response to temperature. The expression of hupA was highly induced in elevated temperatures in the human pathogenic strain when tested in iron-depleted conditions. Conversely, hvtA expression was induced significantly in the eel pathogenic strain at a lower temperature, a condition where the hupA locus was relatively repressed. Our results indicate that although both hupA and hvtA are involved for optimal hemin uptake in V. vulnificus, their expression is dually regulated by the environmental cues of iron concentration and temperature. Together, these data suggest that the virulence genes hupA and hvtA are tightly regulated and strictly induced during iron limitation combined with the physiological temperature of the host organism.","341":null,"342":null,"343":"The small hive beetle (SHB) is an opportunistic parasite that feeds on bee larvae, honey, and pollen. While SHBs can also feed on fruit and other plant products, like its plant-feeding relatives, SHBs prefer to feed on hive resources and only reproduce inside bee colonies. As parasites, SHBs are inevitably exposed to bee-associated microbes, either directly from the bees or from the hive environment. These microbes have unknown impacts on beetles, nor is it known how extensively beetles transfer microbes among their bee hosts. To identify sets of beetle microbes and the transmission of microbes from bees to beetles, a metagenomic analysis was performed. We identified sets of herbivore-associated bacteria, as well as typical bee symbiotic bacteria for pollen digestion, in SHB larvae and adults. Deformed wing virus was highly abundant in beetles, which colonize SHBs as suggested by a controlled feeding trial. Our data suggest SHBs are vectors for pathogen transmission among bees and between colonies. The dispersal of host pathogens by social parasites via floral resources and the hive environment increases the threats of these parasites to honey bees.","344":"Understanding fish-microbial relationships may be of great value for fish producers as fish growth, development and welfare are influenced by the microbial community associated with the rearing systems and fish surfaces. Accurate methods to generate and analyze these microbial communities would be an important tool to help improve understanding of microbial effects in the industry. In this study, we performed taxonomic classification and determination of operational taxonomic units on Atlantic salmon microbiota by taking advantage of full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences. Skin mucus was dominated by the genera Flavobacterium and Psychrobacter. Intestinal samples were dominated by the genera Carnobacterium, Aeromonas, Mycoplasma and by sequences assigned to the order Clostridiales. Applying Sanger sequencing on the full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene from the pool of 46 isolates obtained in this study showed a clear assignment of the PacBio full-length bacterial 16S rRNA gene sequences down to the genus level. One of the bottlenecks in comparing microbial profiles is that different studies use different 16S rRNA gene regions. Comparisons of sequence assignments between full-length and in silico derived variable 16S rRNA gene regions showed different microbial profiles with variable effects between phylogenetic groups and taxonomic ranks.","345":null,"346":"Planktonic Archaea have been detected in all the world's oceans and are found from surface waters to the deep sea. The two most common Archaea phyla are Thaumarchaeota and Euryarchaeota. Euryarchaeota are generally more common in surface waters, but very little is known about their ecology and their potential metabolisms. In this study, we explore the genomic ecology of the Marine Group II (MGII), the main marine planktonic Euryarchaeota, and test if it is composed of different ecologically relevant units. We re-analyzed Tara Oceans metagenomes from the photic layer and the deep ocean by annotating sequences against a custom MGII database and by mapping gene co-occurrences. Our data provide a global view of the distribution of Euryarchaeota, and more specifically of MGII subgroups, and reveal their association to a number of gene-coding sequences. In particular, we show that MGII proteorhodopsins were detected in both the surface and the deep chlorophyll maximum layer and that different clusters of these light harvesting proteins were present. Our approach helped describing the set of genes found together with specific MGII subgroups. We could thus define genomic environments that could theoretically describe ecologically meaningful units and the ecological niche that they occupy.","347":null,"348":null,"349":null,"350":null,"351":"Microbial natural products serve as a good source for antioxidants.

Identification and characterization methods determine that strain MUM273b belongs to the genus Streptomyces. The MUM273b extract exhibits antioxidant activities, including DPPH, ABTS, and superoxide radical scavenging activities and also metal-chelating activity. The MUM273b extract was also shown to inhibit the production of malondialdehyde in metal-induced lipid peroxidation. Strong correlation between the antioxidant activities and the total phenolic content of MUM273b extract was shown. In addition, MUM273b extract exhibited cytoprotective effect on the UVB-induced cell death in HaCaT keratinocytes. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis detected phenolics, pyrrole, pyrazine, ester, and cyclic dipeptides in MUM273b extract. In summary, Streptomyces MUM273b extract portrays an exciting avenue for future antioxidative drugs and cosmeceuticals development.","352":"The binary association between the squid, Euprymna scolopes, and its symbiont, Vibrio fischeri, serves as a model system to study interactions between beneficial bacteria and the innate immune system. Previous research demonstrated that binding of the squid's immune cells, hemocytes, to V. fischeri is altered if the symbiont is removed from the light organ, suggesting that host colonization alters hemocyte recognition of V. fischeri. To investigate the influence of symbiosis on immune maturation during development, we characterized hemocyte binding and phagocytosis of V. fischeri and nonsymbiotic Vibrio harveyi from symbiotic (sym) and aposymbiotic (apo) juveniles, and wild-caught and laboratory-raised sym and apo adults. Our results demonstrate that while light organ colonization by V. fischeri did not alter juvenile hemocyte response, these cells bound a similar number of V. fischeri and V. harveyi yet phagocytosed only V. harveyi. Our results also indicate that long-term colonization altered the adult hemocyte response to V. fischeri but not V. harveyi. All hemocytes from adult squid, regardless of apo or sym state, both bound and phagocytosed a similar number of V. harveyi while hemocytes from both wild-caught and sym-raised adults bound significantly fewer V. fischeri, although more V. fischeri were phagocytosed by hemocytes from wild-caught animals. In contrast, hemocytes from apo-raised squid bound similar numbers of both V. fischeri and V. harveyi, although more V. harveyi cells were engulfed, suggesting that blood cells from apo-raised adults behaved similarly to juvenile hosts. Taken together, these data suggest that persistent colonization by the light organ symbiont is required for hemocytes to differentially bind and phagocytose V. fischeri. The cellular immune system of E. scolopes likely possesses multiple mechanisms at different developmental stages to promote a specific and life-long interaction with the symbiont.","353":"Recent studies taking advantage of automated single-cell time-lapse analysis have reignited interest in the bacterial cell cycle. Several studies have highlighted alternative models, such as Sizer and Adder, which differ essentially in relation to whether cells can measure their present size or their amount of growth since birth. Most of the recent work has been done with Escherichia coli. We set out to study the well-characterized Gram-positive bacterium, Bacillus subtilis, at the single-cell level, using an accurate fluorescent marker for division as well as a marker for completion of chromosome replication. Our results are consistent with the Adder model in both fast and slow growth conditions tested, and with Sizer but only at the slower growth rate. We also find that cell size variation arises not only from the expected variation in size at division but also that division site offset from mid-cell contributes to a significant degree. Finally, although traditional cell cycle models imply a strong connection between the termination of a round of replication and subsequent division, we find that at the single-cell level these events are largely disconnected.","354":null,"355":null,"356":null,"357":null,"358":null,"359":"Influenced by feedstock type and microbial inoculum, different microbial groups must precisely interact for high-quality biogas yields. As a first approach for optimization, this study aimed to identify through time the biogas-producing microbial community in a 10-ton dry anaerobic digester treating cattle manure by denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) and metagenomics. Moreover, the associated bovine residues or feedstocks (leachate, manure, oxidation lagoon water, rumen) were also characterized to determine their contribution. A diverse and dynamic community characterized by Bacteria (82%-88%) and a considerable amount of Archaea (8%-15%) presented profiles particular to each stage of biogas production. Eukaryotes (2.6%-3.6%), mainly fungi, were a minor but stable component. Proteobacteria represented 47% of the community at the start of the run but only 18% at the end, opposite to the Bacteroidetes\/Chlorobi group (8% and 20%, respectively), while Firmicutes (12%-18%) and Actinobacteria (12%-32%) remained relatively constant. Methanogens of the order Methanomicrobiales represented by several species of Methanoculleus were abundant at the end of the run (77%) contrary to Methanosarcinales (11%) and Methanobacteriales (0.7%). Therefore, methanogenesis mainly occurred by the hydrogenotrophic pathway. Manure and oxidation lagoon water seemed to contribute key microorganisms, while rumen dominated by Methanobrevibacter (72%) did not proliferate in the digester. Manure particularly possessed Methanoculleus (24%) and uncultured methanogens identified by DGGE, whereas oxidation lagoon was exclusively abundant in Methanolinea (18%) and Methanosaeta (19%). Leachate, as the microbial inoculum from a previous run, adequately preserved the biogas-producing community. These results could lead to higher biogas yields through bioaugmentation strategies by incorporating higher proportions or an enriched inoculum from the relevant feedstocks.","360":"In this study, we compared the expression of CYP153, sodA, sodC, and recA genes and ROS generation in hydrocarbon-degrading Rhodococcus erythropolis in the presence of cyclohexane, naphthalene, and diesel fuel. The expression of cytochrome P450, sodA (encoding Fe\/Mn superoxide dismutase), recA, and superoxide anion radical generation rate increased after the addition of all studied hydrocarbons. The peak of CYP153, sodA, and recA gene expression was registered in the presence of naphthalene. The same substrate upregulated the Cu\/Zn superoxide dismutase gene, sodC. Cyclohexane generated the highest level of superoxide anion radical production. Hydrogen peroxide accumulated in the medium enriched with diesel fuel. Taken together, hydrocarbon biotransformation leads to oxidative stress and upregulation of antioxidant enzymes and CYP153 genes, and increases DNA reparation levels in R. erythropolis cells.","361":"Planting resistant cultivars is the most economical and effective measure to control wheat stripe rust caused by Puccinia striiformis f. sp. tritici (Pst), but the cultivars often lose their resistance due to the emergence of new physiological races. The UV-B-irradiated urediospores of the Pst physiological race CYR32 in China were inoculated on wheat cultivar Guinong 22 for screening virulence-mutant strains. CYR32 and mutant strains (CYR32-5 and CYR32-61) before and after UV-B radiation were used to conduct urediospore morphological and histopathological observations and an investigation of epidemiological components. The results showed that UV-B radiation affected the urediospore morphology of each strain. UV-B radiation inhibited urediospore invasion and hyphal elongation, which mainly manifested as decreases in germination rate, quantities of hyphal branches, haustorial mother cells and haustoria and hyphal length. After wheat cultivar Mingxian 169 was inoculated with the UV-B-irradiated urediospores, the incubation period was prolonged, and the infection efficiency, lesion expansion rate, total sporulation quantity and area under the disease progress curve were reduced. The results demonstrated that CYR32-5 and CYR32-61 may have more tolerance to UV-B radiation than CYR32. The results are significant for understanding mechanisms of Pst virulence variations and implementing sustainable management of wheat stripe rust.","362":null,"363":"In cyanobacteria, genes conferring mercury resistance are not organized as mer-operon, unlike in other bacterial phyla. Synechocystis contains only a putative MerR regulator, Slr0701, and a mercury reductase, MerA, located aside from each other in the genome. The slr0701-mutant showed reduction in photosynthetic activity and reduced tolerance to mercury compared to the wild-type. The incubation of wild-type cells with HgCl2 resulted in the upregulation of slr0701 and slr1849 genes whereas mercury-induced expression was not observed in the slr0701-mutant. Slr0701 binds to a conserved cis-regulatory element located in the upstream of slr1849 and slr0701 ORFs. The same element was also identified in the upstream of other cyanobacterial homologs. Slr0701 binds to cis-regulatory element with faster association and slower dissociation rates in the presence of HgCl2 . Although these genes were constitutively expressed, the addition of HgCl2 enhanced their promoter activity suggesting that mercury-bound Slr0701 triggers induced expression of these genes. The enhanced promoter activity could be attributed to the observed secondary structural changes in Slr0701 in the presence of HgCl2 . For the first time, we demonstrated the mechanism of merA regulation in a cyanobacterium, Synechocystis. Although merA and merR genes are distantly located on the cyanobacterial genome and distinct from other bacterial mer-operons, the transcriptional regulatory mechanism is conserved.","364":null,"365":"It has been widely accepted that there is a distance-decay pattern in the soil microbiome. However, few studies have attempted to interpret the microbial distance-decay pattern from the perspective of quantifying underlying processes. In this study, we examined the processes governing bacterial community assembly at multiple spatial scales in maize fields of Northeast China using Illumina MiSeq sequencing. Results showed that the processes governing spatial turnover in bacterial community composition shifted regularly with spatial scale, with homogenizing dispersal dominating at small spatial scales and variable selection dominating at larger scales, which in turn explained the distance-decay pattern that closer located sites tended to have higher community similarity. Together, homogenizing dispersal and dispersal limitation resulting from geographic factors governed about 33% of spatial turnover in bacterial community composition. Deterministic selection processes had the strongest influence, at 57%, with biotic factors and abiotic environmental filtering (mainly imposed by soil pH) respectively contributing about 37% and 63% of variation. Our results provided a novel and comprehensive way to explain the distance-decay pattern of soil microbiome via quantifying the assembly processes at multiple spatial scales, as well as the method to quantify the influence of abiotic, biotic, and geographic factors in shaping microbial community structure, thus enabling understanding of widely acknowledged microbial biogeographic patterns and microbial ecology.","366":null,"367":"The eukaryotic GINS, Cdc45, and minichromosome maintenance proteins form an essential complex that moves with the DNA replication fork.

Six structural genes and five regulatory genes comprise the fim gene cluster that is responsible for the production of type 1 fimbriae in S. Typhimurium. The fimY gene encodes a positive regulator for type 1 fimbrial expression since a deletion in fimY abolished the production of fimbriae. The N-terminal portion of FimY contains amino acid residues that exhibit some similarity as those found in the proteins possessing the PilZ domain, which is engaged in cyclic di-GMP binding. A fimY allele that had a change from arginine to alanine at position 7 (R7A) or 7 and 11 (R7\/11A) generated by site-directed mutagenesis in a 6 RRERH11 R motif near N-terminal, when cloned in pACYC184 and transformed into a fimY-deleted strain, decreased the expression of fimA and fimZ. The number of type 1 fimbriae in these two transformants was also less than those of the other transformants that contained different fimY alleles in pACYC184 when observed in electron microscopy. However, changing from arginine to alanine at position 11 (R11A) remained the same as the wild-type fimY allele. It is likely that the arginine at the 7th position of FimY is critical for its maximal activating activity upon fimZ. Another motif 83 DI85 SLWIEK91 G motif did not affect the function of FimY. Although FimY has the two aforementioned motifs, which contain some amino acids that are present within those of the PilZ domain proteins, secondary structure prediction analysis did not reveal that FimY has a conformation commonly observed in PilZ-like proteins. Therefore, FimY and PilZ domain proteins are not homologs. Further investigation for a detailed analysis of FimY is thus warranted.","375":null,"376":null,"377":"In recent years, the rise in antimicrobial resistance (AR) in the healthcare setting as well as the environment has been recognized as a growing public health problem.

Growth of C. didymus is inhibited if mixed cultures of the two diatoms are infected with the bacterium. Incubations with filtrates of the infected cultures show that the effects are chemically mediated. In non-contact co-culturing we show that low concentrations of the lysed algae support the growth of C. didymus, while higher concentrations trigger population decline.

The Mycobacterium tuberculosis was investigated using MIRU-VNTR and the Mycobacterium tuberculosis families were evaluated using spoligotyping. Spoligotyping grouped 91% of the isolates into seven clusters, while 9% of the deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) from TB isolates were unclustered from a total of 154 DNA used. Previously described shared types were observed in 89.6% of the isolates, with the Beijing family, SIT1, the principal genotype in the province, while the families T, SIT53 and X1, SIT1329 were the least detected genotypes. MIRU-VNTR grouped 81% of the isolates in 23 clusters while 19% were unclustered. A combination of the VNTR and spoligotyping grouped 79% of the isolates into 23 clusters with 21% unclustered. The low level of diversity and the clonal spread of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates advocate that the spread of TB in this study may be instigated by the clonal spread of Beijing genotype. The results from this study provide vital information about the lack of TB control and distribution of Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex strain types in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa.","407":null,"408":null,"409":"The production and release of extracellular vesicles (EVs) is a common process occurring in various types of bacteria. However, little is known regarding the functions of EVs derived from marine bacteria. We observed that during cell growth, Sediminicola sp. YIK13, a proteorhodopsin (PR)-containing marine flavobacterium, produces EVs (S13EVs). Transmission electron microscopy showed that Sediminicola sp. YIK13 released two spherical vesicle types, with mono- and\/or bi-layered membranes, in the culture. Interestingly, the S13EVs have an orange pigment, indicating the presence of putative carotenoid and PR pigments ascribed to the parental cells. The S13EVs demonstrated the same PR-derived absorption peak spectrum and light-induced proton pump activity as the parental cells. Western blot (immunoblot) analysis of the S13EVs revealed the presence of PR. We confirmed the 16S rRNA gene, pro gene, and genes required for chromophore retinal synthesis, namely blh and crtI, in the DNA packaged into these vesicles. In addition, by metagenomic sequencing, we found microbial rhodopsin-related genes in vesicles derived from natural aquatic environments. Our results suggest that EVs as well potentially pursue horizontal gene transfer of diverse microbial rhodopsin genes in marine ecosystems.","410":"Aptamers that bind live bacterial cells have been widely investigated, but their potential to inhibit Candida albicans biofilm formation needs to be further explored. The aims of this study were to evaluate the binding of C. albicans to RNA aptamers and to examine the potential of aptamers to inhibit C. albicans biofilm formation in vitro. In this study, RNA aptamers selected against yeast cells of C. albicans ATCC 10231 were developed using the systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) technique. The binding affinity of the resulting aptamers was then determined by an aptamer-linked immobilized sorbent assay (ALISA), and a colorimetric (MTT) assay was used to measure the metabolic activity of Candida biofilms. After 11 rounds of SELEX, two candidate aptamers, Ca-apt-1 and Ca-apt-12, were identified. The Ca-apt-1 aptamer also recognized C. albicans isolated from clinical specimens but did not recognize other oral microorganisms (i.e., Streptococcus mutans and Saccharomyces cerevisiae). The ALISA results showed that the binding affinity of these aptamers was comparable to that of an anti-C. albicans monoclonal antibody. In addition, Ca-apt-1 could inhibit biofilm and hyphal formation of C. albicans in vitro, as demonstrated using biofilm assays. This study shows that RNA aptamers could potentially be used in diagnostic and therapeutic applications for C. albicans-related disease in the future.","411":null,"412":null,"413":"Magnetic immobilization of quorum sensing (QS) signal hydrolases provides a convenient solution for quenching QS process that is essential for bacterial biofilm formation and antimicrobial resistance. In the present study, a QS signal hydrolase, AiiA, was fused with a magnetic protein, MagR, and expressed in Escherichia coli. Magnetic immobilization of AiiA was achieved on Fe3 O4 -SiO2 iron beads and was confirmed via SDS-PAGE, zeta potential measurement, FTIR spectrometry, and SEM analysis. The magnetic immobilized AiiA exhibited activity in degrading the quorum sensing signal, C6-HSL.

After treatment with Cu2+ , Pb2+ , and low pH, the expression of oxidative phosphorylation pathway genes, including coxA, coxB, coxC, ccoN, ccoO, and ccoQ, was found commonly downregulated by RNA-seq as well as quantitative real-time PCR. RNAi significantly reduced the expression of coxA, coxB, coxC, ccoN, ccoO, and ccoQ in V. alginolyticus. Compared with the wild-type strain, the adhesion abilities of RNAi strains of V. alginolyticus were significantly impaired, as well as their cytochrome C oxidase activity. ccoQ appeared to be more important in the regulation of bacterial adhesion in these target genes, while ccoO was relatively weak in the regulation of the adhesion. Meanwhile, the changes of temperature, salinity, pH, and starvation affected coxA, coxB, coxC, ccoN, ccoO, and ccoQ expression remarkably. These findings indicated that: the oxidative phosphorylation pathway is a critical regulator of adhesion in V. alginolyticus; coxA, coxB, coxC, ccoN, ccoO, and ccoQ regulate the bacterial adhesion in response to environmental changes such as temperature, salinity, pH, and starvation.","415":null,"416":null,"417":null,"418":"This study provides a deep modern insight into the phylogenetic diversity among bacterial consortia found in working and nonworking high-methane natural gas pipelines located in Poland. The working pipeline was characterized by lower biodiversity (140-154 bacterial genera from 22 to 23 classes, depending on the source of the debris) in comparison to the off-gas pipeline (169 bacterial genera from 23 classes). The sediment recovered from the working pipeline contained mostly DNA identified as belonging to the phylum Firmicutes (66.4%-45.9% operational taxonomic units [OTUs]), predominantly Bacillus (41.4%-31.1% OTUs) followed by Lysinibacillus (2.6%-1.5% OTUs) and Clostridium (2.4%-1.8% OTUs). In the nonworking pipeline, Proteobacteria (46.8% OTUs) and Cyanobacteria (27.8% OTUs) were dominant. Over 30% of the Proteobacteria sequences showed homologies to Gammaproteobacteria, with Pseudomonas (7.1%), Enhydrobacter (2.1%), Stenotrophomonas (0.5%), and Haempohilus (0.4%) among the others. Differences were noted in terms of the chemical compositions of deposits originating from the working and nonworking gas pipelines. The deposits from the nonworking gas pipeline contained iron, as well as carbon (42.58%), sulphur (15.27%), and oxygen (15.32%). This composition can be linked to both the quantity and type of the resident microorganisms. The presence of a considerable amount of silicon (17.42%), and of aluminum, potassium, calcium, and magnesium at detectable levels, may likewise affect the metabolic activity of the resident consortia in the working gas pipeline. All the analyzed sediments included both bacteria known for causing and intensifying corrosion (e.g., Pseudomonas, Desulfovibrio, Shewanella, Serratia) and bacteria that can protect the surface of pipelines against deterioration (e.g., Bacillus). Biocorrosion is not related to a single mechanism or one species of microorganism, but results from the multidirectional activity of multiple microbial communities. The analysis presented here of the state of the microbiome in a gas pipeline during the real gas transport is a particularly valuable element of this work.","419":null,"420":null,"421":null,"422":"Hemodialysis patients are particularly vulnerable to Staphylococcus aureus infection, with the vascular access serving as the site of entry for this formidable pathogen. Patients with arteriovenous grafts (AVGs) and tunneled-cuffed catheters (TCCs) are at elevated risk of S. aureus infection. In this study, we investigated the correlation between the clinical characteristics of S. aureus vascular access infection (VAI), molecular profiles, and the biofilm formation abilities of clinical isolates of S. aureus. We collected samples of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA), and methicillin-sensitive S. argenteus (MSSAg) from patients with S. aureus VAI and patients with other infections. The molecular profiles of the clinical isolates were determined using disk diffusion testing and molecular typing. The biofilm formation ability was determined by microtiter plate assay. In total, 63 S. aureus and 10 S. argenteus isolates were identified: 40 MRSA, 23 MSSA, and ten MSSAg. MRSA was highly prevalent (77.8%) in TCC isolates and was multidrug resistant. Of the 40 MRSA isolates, ST239-SCCmec III was the predominant clone. SCCmec type IV was the predominant type (35%) in isolates from AVGs, while SCCmec type III was prevalent in TCC infection and showed significantly higher biofilm formation ability than types IV and V. In dialysis VAI by S. aureus, patients with TCC were more often infected with MRSA than patients with AVG, and MRSA in TCC-VAI was predominantly SCCmec type III, which had the strongest drug resistance and biofilm formation ability.","423":null,"424":"Here, we present a proof-of-principle for a new high-throughput functional screening of metagenomic libraries for the selection of enzymes with different activities, predetermined by the substrate being used. By this approach, a total of 21 enzyme-coding genes were selected, including members of xanthine dehydrogenase, aldehyde dehydrogenase (ALDH), and amidohydrolase families. The screening system is based on a pro-chromogenic substrate, which is transformed by the target enzyme to indole-3-carboxylic acid. The later compound is converted to indoxyl by a newly identified indole-3-carboxylate monooxygenase (Icm). Due to the spontaneous oxidation of indoxyl to indigo, the target enzyme-producing colonies turn blue. Two types of pro-chromogenic substrates have been tested. Indole-3-carboxaldehydes and the amides of indole-3-carboxylic acid have been applied as substrates for screening of the ALDHs and amidohydrolases, respectively. Both plate assays described here are rapid, convenient, easy to perform, and adaptable for the screening of a large number of samples both in Escherichia coli and Rhodococcus sp. In addition, the fine-tuning of the pro-chromogenic substrate allows screening enzymes with the desired substrate specificity.","425":null,"426":null,"427":null,"428":"Bacteria of the genus Campylobacter are the most common pathogens causing zoonotic diseases in humans. Therefore, the aim of the study was to isolate Campylobacter bacteria from broiler chickens and evaluate their susceptibility to selected antibiotics by determining minimum inhibitory concentrations (MIC), followed by isolation and characterization of bacteriophages specific for Campylobacter spp. The material for the study consisted of field isolates of Campylobacter spp. obtained from the gut (cecum) of broiler chickens directly after slaughter in slaughterhouses, and bacteriophages specific for these strains. We isolated 48 strains from poultry (140 broiler chickens): 31 strains of Campylobacter jejuni and 17 of Campylobacter coli. Identification of the strains was confirmed by multiplex PCR and MALDI-TOF mass spectrometry. Over 83% of Campylobacter strains were resistant to ciprofloxacin, and over half the isolates were resistant to erythromycin, gentamicin, and tetracycline. Resistance to three or more antibiotics was observed in 91.6% of all strains. Four bacteriophages were obtained, and on the basis of their morphological structure, they were assigned to two families of the order Caudovirales: Myoviridae and Siphoviridae. A high percentage of the Campylobacter strains were resistant to at least three of the antibiotic groups tested. All of the phages exhibited lytic activity against the Campylobacter spp. isolates, but the antibacterial effect of the phages was not observed for all strains.","429":null,"430":null,"431":null,"432":null,"433":null,"434":"Nitrilase enzymes (EC 3.5.5.1) are responsible for the direct hydration of nitriles to their corresponding carboxylic acids and ammonia.

This means there is a critical need to reliably and cost-effectively detect, identify, and monitor these fungi at large scales. We investigated and analyzed the causes of differences between next-generation sequencing (NGS) metabarcoding approaches and traditional DNA cloning in the detection and quantification of recognized species of rust fungi from environmental samples. We found significant differences between observed and expected numbers of shared rust fungal operational taxonomic units (OTUs) among different methods. However, there was no significant difference in relative abundance of OTUs that all methods were capable of detecting. Differences among the methods were mainly driven by the method's ability to detect specific OTUs, likely caused by mismatches with the NGS metabarcoding primers to some Puccinia species. Furthermore, detection ability did not seem to be influenced by differences in sequence lengths among methods, the most appropriate bioinformatic pipeline used for each method, or the ability to detect rare species. Our findings are important to future metabarcoding studies, because they highlight the main sources of difference among methods, and rule out several mechanisms that could drive these differences. Furthermore, strong congruity among three fundamentally different and independent methods demonstrates the promising potential of NGS metabarcoding for tracking important taxa such as rust fungi from within larger NGS metabarcoding communities. Our results support the use of NGS metabarcoding for the large-scale detection and quantification of rust fungi, but not for confirming the absence of species.","440":"The composition of the intestinal microbial community may vary across developmental stages. In this study, we explored how this microbial community shifted along the intestinal tract of the Chinese giant salamander (Andrias davidianus) at various ages. Next-generation sequencing was used to sequence the bacterial 16S rRNA gene from different kind of samples, including the stomach, duodenum, ileum, and rectum. The highest mean relative abundance of the bacterial community in the gastrointestinal tract shifted in relation to age: within the first year, Bacteroidetes (47.76%) dominated the gut microbiome, whereas Proteobacteria was the most dominant at age 2 (32.88%) and age 3 (30.78%), and finally, Firmicutes was the most dominant at age 4 (34.70%). The overall richness of the gut bacterial community also generally increased from age 2 to 4. Hierarchical cluster analysis revealed that the gut microbiome at age 2 had greater variability than that at either age 3 or 4, likely representing a shift in diet from yolk or redworms as a juvenile to shrimp or crab as an adult. As these salamanders develop, their gastrointestinal tracts increase in complexity, and this compartmentalization may also facilitate an increase in microbial gut diversity.","441":null,"442":null,"443":null,"444":null,"445":null,"446":null,"447":null,"448":null,"449":null,"450":null,"451":null,"452":null,"453":null,"454":null,"455":null,"456":null,"457":null,"458":null,"459":null,"460":null,"461":null,"462":null,"463":"The results of this study indicate that the maize rhizosphere remains a reservoir for microbial strains with unique beneficial properties.

The PCR analysis revealed that lipopeptide genes encoding the synthesis of iturin, surfactin, and fengycin might be responsible for their antifungal activities. Few of the isolates also showed possible biosurfactant capability, and their susceptibility to known antibiotics is indicative of their eco-friendly attributes. In addition, in silico genomic analysis of our best isolate (Bacillus velezensis NWUMFkBS10.5) and characterization of its active metabolite with FTIR, NMR, and ESI-Micro-Tof MS confirmed the presence of valuable genes clusters and metabolic pathways.

Hence, the exploration of new and more efficient methods for elimination of EDC in wastewater is imperative. Enzymatic treatment approach has been suggested as a suitable option. Nonetheless, ligninolytic enzymes seem to be the most promising group of enzymes for EDC elimination, perhaps, owing to their unique catalytic properties and characteristic high redox potentials for oxidation of a wide spectrum of organic compounds.

We created mutants of the TORC1 pathway, alpha-arrestins, and eisosome-related genes. Our results demonstrate that the TORC1-Npr1-Art1\/Rsp5 pathway regulates yeast transformation. Based on our previous study, activation of this pathway results in up to a 200-fold increase in transformation efficiency, or greater. Additionally, we suggest DNA may be taken up by domains at the membrane compartment of Can1 (MCC) in the plasma membrane formed by eisosomes.

The spider mite, Tetranychus truncatus, is a polyphagous agricultural pest harboring various bacterial symbionts whose function is largely unknown. Here, by using a high-throughput 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing approach, we characterized the bacterial diversity and community composition of spider mites fed on five host plants after communities were modified following tetracycline exposure. We demonstrated that spider mite bacterial diversity and community composition were significantly affected by host plants and antibiotics. In particular, the abundance of the maternally inherited endosymbionts Wolbachia and Spiroplasma significantly differed among spider mites that were reared on different plant species and were completely removed by antibiotics. There was an overall tendency for daily fecundity to be lower in the mites with reduced bacterial diversity following the antibiotic treatment. Our data suggest that host plants and antibiotics can shape spider mite bacterial communities and that bacterial symbionts improve mite performance.","477":"As an important organ to maintain the host's homeostasis, intestinal microbes play an important role in development of the organism. In contrast to those of terrestrial animals, the intestinal microbes of aquatic organisms are affected by environmental microorganisms (including water microorganisms and sediment microorganisms). In the present study, the compositional differences of intestinal microbes in three representative developmental stages of the Chinese mitten crab (Eriocheir sinensis) were studied. Meanwhile, network association analysis, and visualization of the water microorganisms of the crabs' habitat, the environment microorganisms in the pond, and the intestinal microbes, was carried out. The results showed that the gut microbiota diversity index decreased continuously with age, and the four bacteria of Aeromonas (Proteobacteria), Defluviitaleaceae (Firmicutes), Candidatus Bacilloplasma (Tenericutes), and Dysgonomonas (Bacteroidetes) were the \"indigenous\" flora of the crab. In the network-related analysis with the environment, we found that as the culture time increased, the effect of environmental microorganisms on the intestinal microbes of crabs gradually decreased, and the four \"indigenous\" bacteria were always unaffected by the environmental microorganisms. The results of this study identified the core bacteria of the crab and, for the first time, studied the relationship between intestinal environmental microorganisms, which will aid the practical production of crabs and will promote research into the relationship between specific bacteria and the physiological metabolism of crabs.","478":"The Chinese concave-eared frog (Odorrana tormota) is a rare and threatened species with remarkable sexual dimorphism.

Here, this study analyzed the microbiota of the intestinal tract of both female and male, healthy as well as nematode-infested concave-eared frogs using high throughput 16S rRNA sequencing and metagenomic techniques. The results showed that the bacterial composition of the microbiota at the phylum level was dominated by Firmicutes, Verrucomicrobia, Bacteroidetes, and Proteobacteria. The study also revealed that the community composition below the class level could be represent sex differences, particularly with regard to Enterobacteriales, Enterobacteriaceae, Peptostreptococcaceae, and Rikenellaceae, among others. Carbohydrate-active enzyme-encoding genes and modules were identified in related gut bacteria by metagenomic analysis, with Bacteroidia, Clostridia, and gammaproteobacteria predicted to be the main classes of chitin-decomposing bacteria in the frog intestine. In addition, the abundance of some bacteria significantly increased or decreased in nematode-infected hosts compared with healthy individuals, including Verrucomicrobia, Verrucomicrobiae, Negativicutes, Actinobacteria, and Bacilli, among others.

High primary production leads to eutrophic waters in the surface layers, whereas sinking phytoplankton debris and horizontally dispersed particles form nepheloid layers (NLs) and hypoxic waters at depth. We used Catalyzed Reporter Deposition Fluorescence In Situ Hybridization (CARD-FISH) in combination with fatty acid (measured as methyl ester; FAME) profiles to investigate the bacterial and archaeal community composition along transects from neritic to pelagic waters within the \"giant Cape Blanc filament\" in two consecutive years (2010 and 2011), and to evaluate the usage of FAME data for microbial community studies. We also report the first fatty acid profile of Pelagibacterales strain HTCC7211 which was used as a reference profile for the SAR11 clade. Unexpectedly, the reference profile contained low concentrations of long chain fatty acids 18:1 cis11, 18:1 cis11 11methyl, and 19:0 cyclo11-12 fatty acids, the main compounds in other Alphaproteobacteria. Members of the free-living SAR11 clade were found at increased relative abundance in the hypoxic waters in both years. In contrast, the depth profiles of Gammaproteobacteria (including Alteromonas and Pseudoalteromonas), Bacteroidetes, Roseobacter, and Synechococcus showed high abundances of these groups in layers where particle abundance was high, suggesting that particle attachment or association is an important mechanisms of dispersal for these groups.

Bacterioplankton communities from these estuaries were compared against available bacterioplankton sequence data from Columbia, Delaware, Jiulong, Pearl, and Hangzhou estuaries. All nine estuaries were dominated by Proteobacteria. Other abundant phyla included Bacteroidetes, Firmicutes, Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Planctomycetes, and Verrucomicrobia. The abundant bacterial phyla showed a ubiquitous presence across the estuaries. At class level, the overwhelming abundance of Gammaproteobacteria in the estuaries of Sundarbans and Columbia estuary clearly stood out amidst high abundance of Alphaproteobacteria observed in the other estuaries. Abundant bacterial families including Rhodobacteriaceae, Shingomonadaceae, Acidobacteriaceae, Vibrionaceae, and Xanthomondaceae also showed ubiquitous presence in the studied estuaries. However, rare taxa including Chloroflexi, Tenericutes, Nitrospirae, and Deinococcus-Thermus showed clear site-specific distribution patterns. Such distribution patterns were also reinstated by nMDS ordination plots. Such clustering patterns could hint toward the potential role of environmental parameters and substrate specificity which could result in distinct bacterioplankton communities at specific sites. The ubiquitous presence of abundant bacterioplankton groups along with their strong correlation with surface water temperature and dissolved nutrient concentrations indicates the role of such environmental parameters in shaping bacterioplankton community structure in estuaries.

However, the structure and function of the gut microbial communities associated with these two bird species remain poorly understood. Here, for the first time, we compared gut metagenomes from greylag geese to ruddy shelducks and investigated the similarities and differences between these two bird species in detail. Taxonomic classifications revealed the top three bacterial phyla, Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria, in both greylag geese and ruddy shelducks. Furthermore, between the two species, 12 bacterial genera were found to be more abundant in ruddy shelducks and 41 genera were significantly higher in greylag geese. A total of 613 genera (approximately 70%) were found to be present in both groups. Metabolic categories related to carbohydrate metabolism, metabolism of cofactors and vitamins, lipid metabolism, amino acid metabolism, and glycan biosynthesis and metabolism were significantly more abundant in ruddy shelducks, while greylag geese were enriched in nucleotide metabolism and energy metabolism. The herbivorous greylag geese gut microbiota harbored more carbohydrate-active enzymes than omnivorous ruddy shelducks.

We hypothesized that the genomic potential for ammonia and nitrite oxidation would be greater in the sediment with mussel assemblages, presumably due to mussel biodeposition products, namely ammonia and organic carbon. Regardless of the presence of mussels, upper Mississippi river sediment microbial communities had the largest genomic potential for nitrogen fixation followed by urea catabolism, nitrate metabolism, and nitrate assimilation, as evidenced by analysis of nitrogen cycling pathway abundances. However, genes encoding nitrate and nitrite redox reactions, narGHI and nxrAB, were the most abundant functional genes of the nitrogen cycling gene families. Using linear discriminant analysis (LDA), we found nitrification genes were the most important biomarkers for nitrogen cycling genomic potential when mussels were present, and this presented an opposing effect on the abundance of genes encoding nitric oxide reduction. The genes involved in nitrification that increased the most were amoA associated with comammox Nitrospira and nxr homologs associated with Nitrospira. On the other hand, the most distinctive biomarkers of microbial communities without mussels were norB and nrfA, as part of denitrification and dissimilatory nitrate reduction to ammonium pathways, respectively.

Molecular fingerprints showed a distinct clustering of cyanobacterial communities with a close relationship between Arctic and Alpine populations, which differed from those found in Antarctica. Species richness and diversity supported these results, which were also confirmed by microscopic investigations of living cyanobacteria from the BSCs. Isolate-based sequencing corroborated these trends as cold biome clades were assigned, which included a potentially new Arctic clade of Oculatella. Thus, our results contribute to the debate regarding biogeography of cyanobacteria of cold biomes.","499":null,"500":null,"501":null,"502":null,"503":"Salmonella is a pathogen of public health concern. Each year, Salmonella infections cost to the food industry approximately $2.3 billion and 33% of the reported cases are associated with beef, poultry, or pork. Pathogen presence in feed mills can represent one of the many potential routes for entry and transmission into the food production chain. Nevertheless, little is known about Salmonella incidence and association with these types of environments. The objective of this study was to investigate Salmonella presence in different feed mills across the United States. Eleven facilities were selected in eight states and 12 sites were sampled within each feed mill. Samples were analyzed following the FSIS guidelines for isolation and identification of Salmonella. Positive isolates were further investigated by a PCR analysis targeting the invA gene to differentiate for Salmonella enterica. The total number of environmental samples collected was 237: 66% resulted culture positive and 13.1% were PCR positive. All sampled feed mills had at least one culture positive site and following production flow the number of positive samples decreased from ingredient receiving to final product. These preliminary results demonstrate the presence of Salmonella in selected United States feed mills and suggest their potential role as vehicle for pathogen transmission and spread into the food production chain.","504":null,"505":null,"506":null,"507":"Members of the genus Nocardia are widespread in diverse environments; a wide range of Nocardia species are known to cause nocardiosis in several animals, including cat, dog, fish, and humans. Of the pathogenic Nocardia species, N. seriolae is known to cause disease in cultured fish, resulting in major economic loss. We isolated two N. seriolae strains, CK-14008 and EM15050, from diseased fish and sequenced their genomes using the PacBio sequencing platform. To identify their genomic features, we compared their genomes with those of other Nocardia species. Phylogenetic analysis showed that N. seriolae shares a common ancestor with a putative human pathogenic Nocardia species. Moreover, N. seriolae strains were phylogenetically divided into four clusters according to host fish families. Through genome comparison, we observed that the putative pathogenic Nocardia strains had additional genes for iron acquisition. Dozens of antibiotic resistance genes were detected in the genomes of N. seriolae strains; most of the antibiotics were involved in the inhibition of the biosynthesis of proteins or cell walls. Our results demonstrated the virulence features and antibiotic resistance of fish pathogenic N. seriolae strains at the genomic level. These results may be useful to develop strategies for the prevention of fish nocardiosis.","508":null,"509":null,"510":null,"511":"The present study aimed to determine the differences in gut microbiota between patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) and healthy controls (HC) and search for better microbial biomarkers associated with CKD. The 16S rRNA gene sequencing approach was used to investigate the differences in gut microbiota between the CKD and HC groups. The study found that 12 phylotypes were overrepresented in the CKD group and 19 in the HC group at the genus level. Furthermore, genera Lachnospira and Ruminococcus_gnavus performed the best in differentiating between HC and CKD populations. In addition, this novel study found that the genera Holdemanella, Megamonas, Prevotella 2, Dielma, and Scardovia were associated with the progression of CKD and hemodialysis. In conclusion, the composition of gut microbiota was different in CKD populations compared with healthy populations, and Lachnospira and R._gnavus were better microbial biomarkers. In addition, five phylotypes, including Holdemanella, Megamonas, Prevotella2, Dielma, and Scardovia, served as an indicator of the progression of CKD and hemodialysis. However, large-scale prospective studies should be performed to identify the reliability of the set of these phylotypes as biomarkers.","512":null,"513":null,"514":"Over 20 genes are involved in the biogenesis and function of the Neisseria Type IV pilus (Tfp). In the pathogenic species, RpoD and the integration host factor (IHF) protein regulate expression of pilE, encoding the Tfp structural subunit. We previously reported that in commensal species, pilE transcription is regulated by RpoN, IHF, and activator Npa. Npa has many hallmarks of response regulators in two-component regulatory systems, leading us to search for its response regulator partner. We report that Npa partners with sensor kinase Nps to control pilE transcription. Among the genes involved in Tfp biogenesis and function, only pilE is controlled by RpoN and Npa\/Nps. We summarize our findings in a model, and discuss the implications of the differential regulation of pilE the context of Neisseria Tfp biogenesis.","515":null,"516":"Cryptoendolithic bacterial communities in the Jurassic Navajo Sandstones play an important ecological role in this ecosystem. Developing a better understanding of the role of these cryptoendolithic communities required a deeper knowledge of the microbial diversity present. We analyzed the bacterial diversity in eight sandstones samples from several microgeological features associated with a large sandstone dome. Cryptoendolithic bacterial diversity is clustered into three distinct groups which correlated with topography, suggesting the duration of water retention might be a factor. Comparisons of diversity between each cluster showed that a core bacterial community exists in this habitat. The overall bacterial community structure was dominated by Cyanobacteria, Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Actinobacteria. The most prevalent genera in cyanobacteria were Leptolyngbya, Chroococcidiopsis, and unclassified cyanobacteria accounting for the bulk of cyanobacterial sequences. Within the Proteobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria were the largest class detected, with members of the Acetobacteraceae, particularly the genus Acidiphilium, being the most abundant. Acidiphilium spp. are capable of aerobic ferric iron reduction under moderately acidic conditions, explaining the high levels of iron (II) in this system. This study highlights the extent of unexplored bacterial diversity in this habitat system and sets the premise for elaborating on the ecological function of cryptoendolithic communities.","517":null,"518":null,"519":null,"520":null,"521":null,"522":null,"523":null,"524":null,"525":null,"526":"Diatoms frequently dominate marine and freshwater biofilms as major primary producers. Nutrient resources in these biofilms are patchily distributed and fluctuate dynamically over time. We recently reported that this spatially and temporally structured environment can be exploited by motile diatoms that use chemoattraction to dissolved silicate (dSi) under Si starvation. Here, we show that the behavioral response of diatoms is more complex and selective as cells are also responding to gradients of dissolved phosphate (dP) when starved in this nutrient. In contrast, neither nitrate nor ammonium (dN) triggers an attractive response under nitrogen limitation. Video monitoring and movement pattern analysis of the model diatom Seminavis robusta revealed that dP attraction is mediated by a combined chemokinetic and chemotactic response. After locating nutrient hotspots, the microalgae slow down and recover from the limitation. The fastest recovery in terms of growth was observed after dSi limitation. In agreement with the lack of directional response, recovery from dN limitation was slowest, indicating that no short-term benefit would be drawn by the algae from the location of transient hotspots of this resource. Our results highlight the ability of diatoms to adapt to nutrient limitation by active foraging and might explain their success in patchy benthic environments.","527":"Modern agricultural practices have undeniably increased global food production. On the other hand, agricultural practices not only lead to a degradation of natural ecosystems but also affect the functioning of ecosystems and the related services they provide. Even though impacts of anthropogenic activities vary across ecosystems, freshwater ecosystems are among those affected to a higher degree. In comparison to surface water ecosystems, groundwater ecosystems are less affected by anthropogenic pollutants, as the overlaying soil retains organic and inorganic substances. However, it has become evident that the excessive use of fertilizers has led to the eutrophication of many aquifers. Bacterial communities, which significantly contribute to the cycling of matter due to their metabolic capacities, are prone to environmental perturbations, and structural variation of bacterial communities may consequently affect the functioning of groundwater ecosystems. Our present paper intends to evaluate the impact of anthropogenic activities on environmental conditions as well as on the structural properties of bacterial communities in groundwater. We repeatedly sampled emerging groundwater at five spring sites belonging to different catchments and determined the concentration of abiotic variables as well as the diversity and composition of bacterial communities on a local scale. We hypothesized that anthropogenic activities influence the concentration of abiotic variables, especially of nitrate, as well as the composition and diversity of bacterial communities in groundwater. Our results show that underground spring catchment areas only slightly differ regarding the concentration of abiotic variables as well as the structure of bacterial communities. Furthermore, abiotic variables, presumably influenced by anthropogenic activities, do not correlate with the diversity and composition of bacterial communities. Although supported only by circumstantial evidence, we suggest that upwelling groundwater from the deeper aquifer affects the diversity and composition of bacterial communities, and we argue that bacterial communities act as useful indicators for environmental changes.","528":null,"529":null,"530":null,"531":null,"532":null,"533":"The gut microbiota is now known as a key factor in mammalian physiology and health. Our understanding of the gut microbial communities and their effects on ecology and evolution of their hosts is extremely limited in bats which represent the second largest mammalian order. In the current study, gut microbiota of three sampling sources (small intestine, large intestine, and feces) were characterized in two sympatric and insectivorous bats (Rhinolophus sinicus and Myotis altarium) by high-throughput sequencing of the V3-V4 region of the 16S rRNA gene. Combining with published studies, this work reveals that Gammaproteobacteria may be a dominant class in the whole Chiroptera and Fusobacteria is less observed in bats although it has been proven to be dominant in other mammals. Our results reveal that the sampling source influences alpha diversity of the microbial community in both studied species although no significant variations of beta diversity were observed, which support that fecal samples cannot be used as a proxy of the microbiota in other gut regions in wild animals.","534":"Ribosome often stalls on mRNA sequences harboring consecutive proline codons. Elongation factor P (EF-P) is required for the stalled ribosome to continue translation and thus the absence of EF-P affects translation of the associated open reading frame. Here we report that EF-P controls translation of the mgtA gene encoding a Mg2+ -transporting ATPase from the intracellualr pathogen Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium. EF-P's effect on mgtA translation is dependent on the 550th and 551st proline codons in the coding region and thus substitution of those proline codons eliminates EF-P-mediated control of MgtA protein without affecting the Mg2+ -transporting activity of the mgtA gene. The Pro550 and Pro551-substituted mgtA gene promotes Salmonella's intramacrophage survival and mouse virulence, suggesting that EF-P-mediated translational control of the mgtA gene is required for Salmonella pathogenesis.","535":"Dehiscence or palatal fistula formation following palatoplasty is a complication that has grave consequences for the patient that include tissue loss, emotional distress to the parents and patient, and further medical costs. Palatal dehiscence or fistula formation is multifactorial following surgery-tension of wound closure, poor patient adherence to postoperative orders and wound infection are the most common causes for this. Oral colonization with pathogenic organisms could play a role in wound healing complications. Identification of intraoral bacteria among patients with cleft palates has thus far not been performed. To identify the spectrum of intraoral bacteria in cleft palate patients in an African setting; a retrospective, chart review was performed at Inkosi Albert Luthuli Central Hospital-a quaternary hospital in Durban, South Africa. All patients with unrepaired cleft palates who underwent palatoplasty in 2015 were included. Fifty-two patients were included. Preoperative throat\/palatal swabs were taken prior to palatoplasty. The various bacteria cultured from the aforementioned swabs were cataloged. Various bacteria were cultured. In total, 23 patients (44.2%) had positive swab cultures. Eighteen cultures (34.6%) had gram-positive growth only, four cultures (7.7%) had gram-negative growth only, while one patient (1.9%) cultured both a gram-positive and a gram-negative organism. Streptococcus viridans was the most commonly cultured organism (19.2%) while beta-hemolytic streptococci were cultured from only 4 swabs (7.7%).

Nine endophytic fungal strains, isolated from the shoots of gramineous plants including Arthraxon hispidus, Eleusine indica, Oplismenus undulatifolius, and Oryza granulata, were identified as Muscodor through phylogenetic analysis of the internal transcribed spacer. Through an SPSS K-means cluster analysis, the nine Muscodor strains were divided into four groups based on the antifungal activities of the VOCs produced by these fungi determined by a two-section confrontation test. The first group contains the strains Y-L-54, W-S-41, Y-S-35, W-T-27, and Y-L-56, which showed the strongest activity. The second and third groups contain W-S-35 and Y-L-43, which showed stronger and moderate activity, respectively. The fourth group contains W-S-38 and N-L-7, which were the weakest in inhibiting the tested pathogens. Thirty-five compounds and the relative amounts of VOCs were determined by SPME-GC-MS and comparison with the NIST14 mass spectrometry database and Agilent MassHunter qualitative and quantitative analyses. These 35 compounds were classified into two different categories: (a) the product of fatty acid degradation, and (b) the intermediate and final metabolite of the metabolic pathway with the precursor of mevalonic acid. SPSS clustering analysis showed that the chemical components of VOCs might be correlated with their bioactivity rather than their phylogenetic assignment and some of the identified compounds might be responsible for antifungal activity. In conclusion, new Muscodor endophytes were recorded in tropical gramineous plants and a number of strains showed remarkable bioactive properties. Therefore, they have important potential applications in the fields of plant disease control.","541":null,"542":null,"543":"Interests in the impact of the gastrointestinal microbiota on health and wellbeing have extended from humans to that of companion animals. While relatively fewer studies to date have examined canine and feline gut microbiomes, analysis of the metagenomic DNA from fecal communities using next-generation sequencing technologies have provided insights into the microbes that are present, their function, and potential to contribute to overall host nutrition and health. As carnivores, healthy dogs and cats possess fecal microbiomes that reflect the generally higher concentrations of protein and fat in their diets, relative to omnivores and herbivores. The phyla Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are highly abundant, and Fusobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria also feature prominently. Proteobacteria is the most diverse bacterial phylum and commonly features in the fecal microbiota of healthy dogs and cats, although its reputation is often sullied as its members include a number of well-known opportunistic pathogens, such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella, and Campylobacter, which may impact the health of the host and its owner. Furthermore, in other host species, high abundances of Proteobacteria have been associated with dysbiosis in hosts with metabolic or inflammatory disorders. In this review, we seek to gain further insight into the prevalence and roles of the Proteobacteria within the gastrointestinal microbiomes of healthy dogs and cats. We draw upon the growing number of metagenomic DNA sequence-based studies which now allow us take a culture-independent approach to examine the functions that this more minor, yet important, group contribute to normal microbiome function.","544":null,"545":null,"546":null,"547":null,"548":"The termite gut microbiome is a model system to investigate microbial interactions and their associations with host.

In this study, we adapted the recently developed microfluidic streak plate (MSP) technique for cultivation of termite gut microbial communities at both aerobic and anaerobic conditions. We found that 99 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) were cultivable by MSP approach and 18 OTUs were documented first time for termite gut microbiota. Further analysis of the bacterial diversities derived by culture-dependent MSP approach and culture-independent 16S rRNA gene typing revealed that both methods have bias in recovery of gut microbiota. In total 396 strains were isolated with MSP technique, and potential new taxa at species and\/or genus levels were obtained that were phylogenetically related to Burkholderia, Micrococcus, and Dysgonomonas.

We studied how rice seed endophyte composition changed over time following crossbreeding, repeated inbreeding, subsequent human selection and planting of different rice seeds in different ecogeographical locations. Using terminal-restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis to study bacterial communities, we observed that diversity between the original parents and their offspring may show significant differences in richness, evenness and diversity indices. Heat maps reveal substantial contributions of both or either parent in the shaping of the bacterial seed endophytes of the offspring. Most of the terminal restriction fragments (T-RFs) of the subsequent progeny could be traced to any or both of its parents while unique T-RFs of the offspring suggest external sources of colonization particularly when the seeds were cultivated in different locations. Many similar groups of endophytic bacteria persist in the seeds even after recultivation in different locations, indicating resilience to environmental changes and conservation of bacteria across generations. This study suggests that parent plants contributed to the shaping of seed bacterial endophytes of their offspring, although it is also possible that these soil grown rice plants recruit similar populations of endophytes from the soil generation after generation. This study also highlights some bacterial groups belonging to Herbaspirillum, Microbacterium, Curtobacterium, Stenotrophomonas, Xanthomonas and Enterobacter that may be part of a transmitted and conserved \"core microbiota\" that are ubiquitous and dominant members of the endophytic communities of the rice seeds.","557":null,"558":null,"559":"The relationship between the internal microbiome of an individual organism and that of its external environment has been little investigated in freshwater ecosystems. Thus, this is an area of interest in freshwater fish biology. Along with the genotype of the fish host, external environment plays an important role in determining the composition of the internal microbiome. Here, we characterized the variability of the microbiome of wild Crucian carp (Carassius auratus), along with those of their surrounding environments (water and mud). We found that each environment had distinct bacterial communities, with varying composition and structure. The primary bacterial phyla identified in the Crucian carp gut were Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria (90% of all bacterial phyla identified); the primary genera identified were Cetobacterium, Aeromonas, and Plesiomonas (85% of all bacterial phyla identified). We identified 1,739 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in the Crucian carp gut, 1,703 in water, and 5,322 in mud. Each environment had unique OTUs, but the fewest unique OTUs (97) were found in the Crucian carp gut. There were significant differences in the relative abundances of different bacterial phyla in the different environments. It may be that only bacterial phyla vital for efficient fish function (e.g., immune response or metabolism), such as Fusobacteria and Proteobacteria, are retained in the Crucian carp gut.","560":"Recent studies have shown that interspecies electron transfer between chemoheterotrophic bacteria and methanogenic archaea can be mediated by electric currents flowing through conductive iron oxides, a process termed electric syntrophy. In this study, we conducted enrichment experiments with methanogenic microbial communities from rice paddy soil in the presence of ferrihydrite and\/or sulfate to determine whether electric syntrophy could be enabled by biogenic iron sulfides. Although supplementation with either ferrihydrite or sulfate alone suppressed methanogenesis, supplementation with both ferrihydrite and sulfate enhanced methanogenesis. In the presence of sulfate, ferrihydrite was transformed into black precipitates consisting mainly of poorly crystalline iron sulfides. Microbial community analysis revealed that a methanogenic archaeon and iron- and sulfate-reducing bacteria (Methanosarcina, Geobacter, and Desulfotomaculum, respectively) predominated in the enrichment culture supplemented with both ferrihydrite and sulfate. Addition of an inhibitor specific for methanogenic archaea decreased the abundance of Geobacter, but not Desulfotomaculum, indicating that Geobacter acquired energy via syntrophic interaction with methanogenic archaea. Although electron acceptor compounds such as sulfate and iron oxides have been thought to suppress methanogenesis, this study revealed that coexistence of sulfate and iron oxide can promote methanogenesis by biomineralization of (semi)conductive iron sulfides that enable methanogenesis via electric syntrophy.","561":"Immune-mediated diseases have increased during the last decades in urban environments. The hygiene hypothesis suggests that increased hygiene level and reduced contacts with natural biodiversity are related to the increase in immune-mediated diseases. We tested whether short-time contact with microbiologically diverse nature-based materials immediately change bacterial diversity on human skin. We tested direct skin contact, as two volunteers rubbed their hands with sixteen soil and plant based materials, and an exposure via fabric packets filled with moss material. Skin swabs were taken before and after both exposures. Next-generation sequencing showed that exposures increased, at least temporarily, the total diversity of skin microbiota and the diversity of Acidobacteria, Actinobacteria, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria and Alpha-, Beta- and Gammaproteobacteria suggesting that contact with nature-based materials modify skin microbiome and increase skin microbial diversity. Until now, approaches to cure or prevent immune system disorders using microbe-based treatments have been limited to use of a few microbial species. We propose that nature-based materials with high natural diversity, such as the materials tested here, might be more effective in modifying human skin microbiome, and eventually, in reducing immune system disorders. Future studies should investigate how long-term changes in skin microbiota are achieved and if the exposure induces beneficial changes in the immune system markers.","562":null,"563":null,"564":"This research project has major applications in the healthcare and biomedical industries.

The aim of the present investigation was to detect possible changes in antimicrobial susceptibility in reisolates of the probiotic strain Lactobacillus plantarum 299v (Lp299v) given to antibiotic treated, critically ill patients. Lp299v-like strains were identified in cultures of biopsies and fecal samples from 32 patients given the probiotic strain enterally in two previous ICU studies. The patients received a variety of antibiotics. Isolates with the same genomic RAPD profile (RAPD-type) as Lp299v were obtained to enable monitoring of antibiotic susceptibility by E-tests. Forty-two isolates, collected throughout the course of illness, were tested against 22 different antibiotics. No obvious decrease in susceptibility was found for 21 of the tested antibiotics. There was a tendency toward decreased susceptibility to ampicillin. The stable antibiotic susceptibility profiles of the Lp299v-like isolates studied here suggests this probiotic is less likely to acquire resistance when administered to critically ill patients treated with broad-spectrum antibiotics.","567":null,"568":null,"569":null,"570":null,"571":null,"572":"Klebsiella pneumoniae represents a major threat to human health due to a combination of its nosocomial emergence and a propensity for acquiring antibiotic resistance.

Recent findings have highlighted the ability of some Gram-negative bacteria to utilize exogenous fatty acids in ways that modify membrane phospholipids and influence virulence phenotypes, such as biofilm formation and antibiotic resistance. This study explores the ability of K. pneumoniae to assimilate and respond to exogenous fatty acids. The combination of thin-layer chromatography liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry confirmed adoption of numerous exogenous polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) into the phospholipid species of K. pneumoniae.

Although bacterial death accompanies Stx release, since bacteria grow clonally the fitness benefits of predator killing accrue to the kin of the sacrificed organism, meaning Stx-mediated protist killing is a form of self-destructive cooperation. We show here that the fitness benefits of Stx production are not restricted to the kin of the phage-encoding bacteria. Instead, nearby \"free loading\" bacteria, irrespective of their genotype, also reap the benefit of Stx-mediated predator killing. This finding indicates that the phage-borne Stx exotoxin behaves as a public good. Stx is encoded by a mobile phage. We find that Stx-encoding phage can use susceptible bacteria in the population as surrogates to enhance toxin and phage production. Moreover, our findings also demonstrate that engulfment and concentration of Stx-encoding and susceptible Stx- bacteria in the Tetrahymena phagosome enhances the transfer of Stx-encoding temperate phage from the host to the susceptible bacteria. This transfer increases the population of cooperating bacteria within the community. Since these bacteria now encode Stx, the predation-stimulated increase in phage transfer increases the population of toxin encoding bacteria in the environment.","578":null,"579":"This study examined the technical bias associated with different DNA extraction methods used in microbiome research. Three methods were used to extract genomic DNA from the same intestinal microbiota sample that was taken from the koi carp Cyprinus carpio var. koi, after which their microbial diversity and community structure were investigated on the basis of a 16S rDNA high-throughput sequencing analysis. Biased results were observed in relation to the number of reads, alpha diversity indexes and taxonomic composition among the three DNA extraction protocols. A total of 1,381 OTUs from the intestinal bacteria were obtained, with 852, 759, and 698 OTUs acquired, using the Lysozyme and Ultrasonic Lysis method, Zirmil-beating Cell Disruption method, and a QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit, respectively. Additionally, 336 OTUs were commonly acquired, using the three methods. The results showed that the alpha diversity indexes (Rarefaction, Shannon, and Chao1) of the community that were determined using the Lysozyme and Ultrasonic Lysis method were higher than those obtained with the Zirmil-beating Cell Disruption method, while the Zirmil method results were higher than those measured, using the QIAamp Fast DNA Stool Mini Kit. Moreover, all the major phyla (ratio&gt;1%) could be identified with all three DNA extraction methods, but the phyla present at a lower abundance (ratio &lt;1%) could not. Similar findings were observed at the genus level. Taken together, these findings indicated that the bias observed in the results about the community structure occurred primarily in OTUs with a lower abundance. The results of this study demonstrate that possible bias exists in community analyses, and researchers should therefore be conservative when drawing conclusions about community structures based on the currently available DNA extraction methods.","580":"To analyze microbial communities in environmental samples, this study combined Denaturing Gradient Gel Electrophoresis of amplified 16S rRNA-genes in total genomic DNA extracts from those samples with gene sequencing. The environmental samples studied were oily seawater and soil samples, that had been bioaugmented with natural materials rich in hydrocarbonoclastic bacteria. This molecular approach revealed much more diverse bacterial taxa than the culture-dependent method we had used in an earlier study for the analysis of the same samples. The study described the dynamics of bacterial communities during bioremediation. The main limitation associated with this molecular approach, namely of not distinguishing hydrocarbonoclastic taxa from others, was overcome by consulting the literature for the hydrocarbonoclastic potential of taxa related to those identified in this study. By doing so, it was concluded that the hydrocarbonoclastic bacterial taxa were much more diverse than those captured by the culture-dependent approach. The molecular analysis also revealed the frequent occurrence of nifH-genes in the total genomic DNA extracts of all the studied environmental samples, which reflects a nitrogen-fixation potential. Nitrogen fertilization is long known to enhance microbial oil-bioremediation.

However, traR, unlike its counterpart on Ti plasmids, is monocistronic and not located in an operon that is inducible by the conjugative opine. Here, we report that both traR and traM are expressed constitutively and not regulated by growth with mannopine. We report two additional regulatory genes, mrtR and tmsP, that are involved in a novel mechanism of control of TraR activity. Both genes are located in the distantly linked region of pAoF64\/95 encoding mannopine utilization. MrtR, in the absence of mannopine, represses the four-gene mocC operon as well as tmsP, which is the distal gene of the eight-gene motA operon. As judged by a bacterial two-hybrid analysis, TmsP, which shows amino acid sequence relatedness with the TraM-binding domain of TraR, interacts with the antiactivator. We propose a model in which mannopine, acting through the repressor MrtR, induces expression of TmsP which then titrates the levels of TraM thereby freeing TraR to activate the tra regulon.","588":"The effect of second messenger cAMP on the physiological aspects of fungal cells such as pigmentation has been reported previously.

Among the detected genera, members of Acidimicrobium, Aeropyrum, Caldilinea, Caldisphaera, Chloracidobacterium, Chloroflexus, Desulfurobacterium, Fervidobacterium, Geobacillus, Meiothermus, Melioribacter, Methanothermococcus, Methanotorris, Roseiflexus, Thermoanaerobacter, Thermoanaerobacterium, Thermoanaerobaculum, and Thermosipho were the main thermophiles containing various GHs that play an important role in cellulose and hemicellulose breakdown. Collectively, the results suggest that the microbial community in this hot spring represents a good source for isolating efficient biomass degrading thermophiles and thermozymes.","591":null,"592":null,"593":"Elevated levels of arsenic (As) in aquifers of South East Asia have caused diverse health problems affecting millions of people who drink As-rich groundwater and consume various contaminated agriculture products. The biogeochemical cycling and mobilization\/immobilization of As from its mineral-bound phase is controlled by pH, oxic\/anoxic conditions, and different microbial processes. The increased As flux generated from ongoing biogeochemical processes in the subsurface in turn affects the in situ microbial communities. This study analyzes how the indigenous arsenite-oxidizing bacteria combat As stress by various biophysical alterations and self-adaptation mechanisms. Fifteen arsenite-oxidizing bacterial strains were isolated and identified using a polyphasic approach. The bacterial strains isolated from these aquifers belong predominantly to arsenite-oxidizing bacterial groups. Of these, the membrane-bound phospholipid fatty acids (PLFA) were characterized in seven selected bacterial isolates grown at different concentrations of As(III) in the medium. One of the significant findings of this study is how the increase in external stress can induce alteration of membrane PLFAs. The change in fatty acid saturation and alteration of their steric conformation suggests alteration of membrane fluidity due to change in As-related stress. However, different bacterial groups can have different degrees of alteration that can affect sustainability in As-rich aquifers of the Bengal Delta Plain.","594":null,"595":null,"596":null,"597":null,"598":null,"599":null,"600":null,"601":null,"602":"High-throughput sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene on the Illumina platform is commonly used to assess microbial diversity in environmental samples. The MiniSeq, Illumina's latest benchtop sequencer, enables more cost-efficient DNA sequencing relative to larger Illumina sequencing platforms (e.g., MiSeq). Here we used a modified custom primer sequencing approach to test the fidelity of the MiniSeq for high-throughput sequencing of the V4 hypervariable region of 16S rRNA genes from complex communities in environmental samples. To this end, we designed additional sequencing primers that enabled application of a dual-index barcoding method on the MiniSeq. A mock community was sequenced alongside the environmental samples in four different sequencing runs as a quality control benchmark. We were able to recapture a realistic richness of the mock community in all sequencing runs, and identify meaningful differences in alpha and beta diversity in the environmental samples. Furthermore, rarefaction analysis indicated diversity in many environmental samples was close to saturation. These results show that the MiniSeq can produce similar quantities of high-quality V4 reads compared to the MiSeq, yet is a cost-effective option for any laboratory interested in performing high-throughput 16S rRNA gene sequencing.","603":null,"604":null,"605":null,"606":null,"607":null,"608":null,"609":"Wolbachia is a group of intracellular bacteria that infect a wide range of arthropods including the Asian citrus psyllid (ACP), Diaphorina citri Kuwayama. This insect is the vector of Candidatus Liberibacter asiaticus (CLas), the causal pathogen of Huanglongbing or citrus greening disease. Here, we investigated the localization pattern and infection dynamics of Wolbachia in different developmental stages of ACP. Results revealed that all developmental stages of ACP including egg, 1st-5th instar nymphs, and adults of both gender were infected with Wolbachia. FISH visualization of an ACP egg showed that Wolbachia moved from the egg stalk of newly laid eggs to a randomly distributed pattern throughout the egg prior to hatching. The infection rate varied between nymphal instars. The titers of Wolbachia in fourth and fifth instar nymphs were significantly higher than those in the first and second instar nymphs. Wolbachia were scattered in all nymphal stages, but with highest intensity in the U-shaped bacteriome located in the abdomen of the nymph. Wolbachia was confined to two symmetrical organizations in the abdomen of newly emerged female and male adults.

In this study, we investigated the effects of mulberry\/alfalfa intercropping on soil physicochemical properties and soil bacterial community by MiSeq sequencing of bacterial 16S rRNA gene. The results showed a significant increase in the contents of available nitrogen, available phosphate, available potassium, and total carbon in the rhizosphere soil of the intercropped alfalfa. Sequencing results showed that intercropping improved bacterial richness and diversity of mulberry and alfalfa based on richness estimates and diversity indices. The relative abundances of Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Firmicutes were significantly higher in intercropping mulberry than in monoculture mulberry; and the abundances of Proteobacteria, Bacteroidetes, and Gemmatimonadetes in the intercropping alfalfa were markedly higher than that in monoculture alfalfa. Bacterial taxa with soil nutrients cycling were enriched in the intercropping system. There were higher relative abundances of Bacillus (0.32%), Pseudomonas (0.14%), and Microbacterium (0.07%) in intercropping mulberry soil, and Bradyrhizobium (1.0%), Sphingomonas (0.56%), Pseudomonas (0.18%), Microbacterium (0.15%), Rhizobium (0.09%), Neorhizobium (0.08%), Rhodococcus (0.06%), and Burkholderia (0.04%) in intercropping alfalfa soil. Variance partition analysis showed that planting pattern contributed 26.7% of the total variation of bacterial community, and soil environmental factors explained approximately 56.5% of the total variation. This result indicated that the soil environmental factors were more important than the planting pattern in shaping the bacterial community in the field soil. Overall, mulberry\/alfalfa intercropping changed soil bacterial community, which was related to changes in soil total carbon, available phosphate, and available potassium.","614":null,"615":"Mercury can be a serious hazard to human health, especially in paddy soils surrounding mining areas. In this study, mercury (Hg)-methylating microbes with the potential biomarker gene hgcA were obtained from 45 paddy soil samples in mercury mining areas in Fenghuang, Wanshan, and Xunyang. In different areas, the abundance of the hgcA gene was affected by different environmental factors, including organic matter, pH, total carbon content, total nitrogen content, and total mercury content. Phylogenetic analysis showed that hgcA microbes in paddy soils were potentially members of the phyla Proteobacteria, Euryarchaeota, Chloroflexi, and two unnamed groups. Canonical correspondence analysis showed that pH and organic matter impacted the hgcA gene diversity and the microbial community structures in paddy soils. The identification of Hg-methylating microbes may be crucial for understanding mercury methylation\/demethylation processes, which would be helpful in assessing the risk of methylmercury contamination in the food chain.","616":"Eutrophication can play a significant role in seagrass decline and habitat loss. Microorganisms in seagrass sediments are essential to many important ecosystem processes, including nutrient cycling and seagrass ecosystem health. However, current knowledge of the bacterial communities, both beneficial and detrimental, within seagrass meadows in response to nutrient loading is limited. We studied the response of sediment bacterial and pathogen communities to nutrient enrichment on a tropical seagrass meadow in Xincun Bay, South China Sea. The bacterial taxonomic groups across all sites were dominated by the Gammaproteobacteria and Firmicutes. Sites nearest to the nutrient source and with the highest NH4 + and PO4 3- content had approximately double the relative abundance of putative denitrifiers Vibrionales, Alteromonadales, and Pseudomonadales. Additionally, the relative abundance of potential pathogen groups, especially Vibrio spp. and Pseudoalteromonas spp., was approximately 2-fold greater at the sites with the highest nutrient loads compared to sites further from the source. These results suggest that proximity to sources of nutrient pollution increases the occurrence of potential bacterial pathogens that could affect fishes, invertebrates and humans. This study shows that nutrient enrichment does elicit shifts in bacterial community diversity and likely their function in local biogeochemical cycling and as a potential source of infectious diseases within seagrass meadows.","617":null,"618":null,"619":"The fungal community of six sand samples from Saudi Arabia and Jordan deserts was characterized by culture-independent analysis via next generation sequencing of the 18S rRNA genes and by culture-dependent methods followed by sequencing of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region.

The internally transcribed spacer (ITS) region and 16S rRNA gene were amplified by PCR from fungal and bacterial isolates and amplicons were sequenced. Sequence analysis and phylogeny revealed fungal phylotypes like Penicillium sp., Cladosporium sp., Penicillium citrinum, Alternaria infectoria, Alternaria alternata, Epicoccum nigrum, and Penicillium chrysogenum which are often implicated in paper deterioration. Bacterial phylotypes closely related to known biodeteriogenic bacteria such as Bacillus spp., Micrococcus spp., Kocuria sp. in accordance with previous studies were characterized. Among the fungal phylotypes described in this study are included well-known allergens such as Penicillium spp., Alternaria spp., and Cladosporium spp. that impose a serious health threat on staff members and scholars. Furthermore, fungal isolates such as Chalastospora gossypii and Trametes ochracea have been identified and implicated in biodeterioration of historical paper manuscripts in this study for the first time.

This study investigated the occurrence of antibiotic resistance in three wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) to determine the role they play in the dissemination of ARGs. Bacterial isolates resistant to tetracycline were collected, and tested against eight antibiotics to determine their resistance profiles and the prevalence of multiple antibiotic resistance. It was found that bacteria resistant to tetracycline were more likely to display resistance to multiple antibiotics compared to those isolates that were not tetracycline resistant. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was used to identify the tetracycline resistance determinants present within the bacterial communities of the WWTPs and receiving waters, and it was found that ARGs may not be released from the treatment process. Identification of isolates showed that there was a large diversity of species in both the tetracycline-resistant and tetracycline-sensitive populations and that the two groups were significantly different in composition. Antibiotic resistance profiles of each population showed that a large diversity of resistance patterns existed within genera suggesting that transmission of ARG may progress by both horizontal gene and vertical proliferation.","626":null,"627":"Multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) of two new biological control strains (S1E40 and S3E12) of Pseudomonas was performed to assess their taxonomic position relative to close lineages, and comparative genomics employed to investigate whether these strains differ in key genetic features involved in hypersensitivity responses (HRs). Strain S3E12, at high concentration, incites HRs on tobacco and corn plantlets while S1E40 does not. Phylogenies based on individual genes and 16S rRNA-gyrB-rpoB-rpoD concatenated sequence data show strains S1E40 and S3E12 clustering in distinct groups. Strain S3E12 consistently clustered with Pseudomonas marginalis, a bacterium causing soft rots on plant tissues. MLSA data suggest that strains S1E40 and S3E12 are novel genotypes. This is consistent with the data of genome-based DNA-DNA homology values that are below the proposed cutoff species boundary. Comparative genomics analysis of the two strains revealed major differences in the type III secretion systems (T3SS) as well as the predicted T3SS secreted effector proteins (T3Es). One nonflagellar (NF-T3SS) and two flagellar T3SSs (F-T3SS) clusters were identified in both strains. While F-T3SS clusters in both strains were relatively conserved, the NF-T3SS clusters differed in the number of core components present. The predicted T3Es also differed in the type and number of CDSs with both strains having unique predicted protease-related effectors. In addition, the T1SS organization of the S3E12 genome has protein-coding sequences (CDSs) encoding for key factors such as T1SS secreted agglutinin repeats-toxins (a group of cytolysins and cytotoxins), a membrane fusion protein (LapC), a T1SS ATPase of LssB family (LapB), and T1SS-associated transglutaminase-like cysteine proteinase (LapP). In contrast, strain S1E40 has all CDSs for the seven-gene operon (pelA-pelG) required for Pel biosynthesis but not S3E12, suggesting that biofilm formation in these strains is modulated differently.

In clinical APEC strains, whether or not AI-2 affects the expression of antibiotic-related genes has not been reported. In this study, we have reported that exogenous AI-2 increase the susceptibility of APEC strains to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (SXT) in a folate synthesis-dependent pathway but not in the LsrR-dependent manner. Our results further explained that exogenous AI-2 can down regulate the transcription of the folate synthetase encoding genes folA and folC, and the folate synthesis-related genes luxS, metE, and metH. Gel shift assays confirmed that LsrR, the AI-2 receptor, did not bind to the promoters of folA and folC, suggesting that exogenous AI-2 might influence folate metabolism by a feedback inhibition effect but not in the LsrR-dependent pathway.

Hypervariable 16S rRNA and shotgun sequencing were performed to describe the first reference of a microbial community in an Amazonian lentic system. Microbial composition consisted mainly of Betaproteobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Alphaproteobacteria, and Actinobacteria in the dry period. The bacteria distribution in the rainy period was notably absent of Cyanobacteria. Microcystis was observed in the dry period in which the gene cluster for cyanotoxins was found.

Differentially expressed pathways and cellular systems were inferred using the network-based algorithm PheNetic. Coculturing affected mainly metabolism in WDL1. Significantly enhanced expression of hylA encoding linuron hydrolase was observed. Moreover, differential expression of several pathways involved in carbohydrate, amino acid, nitrogen, and sulfur metabolism was observed indicating that WDL1 gains carbon and energy from linuron indirectly by consuming excretion products from WDL7 and\/or WDL6. Moreover, in consortium conditions, WDL1 showed a pronounced stress response and overexpression of cell to cell interaction systems such as quorum sensing, contact-dependent inhibition, and Type VI secretion. Since the latter two systems can mediate interference competition, it prompts the question if synergistic linuron degradation is the result of true adaptive cooperation or rather a facultative interaction between bacteria that coincidentally occupy complementary metabolic niches.","639":null,"640":null,"641":"Two techniques based on ompA amplification of Chlamydia trachomatis were compared, being reverse hybridization (RHM) and ompA sequencing (OSA), to investigate the concordance between them and to study the epidemiological relevance of each method.

One hundred and seven C. trachomatis positive samples from Tunisian patients and female sex workers were analyzed using both the RHM and ompA sequencing. The overall genovar distribution obtained with both techniques was very similar. The RHM identified nine genovars, being B, D, E, F, G, H, I, J and K, where B, I, J, and K were only found in mixed infections versus 7 types for the OSA being D, E, F, G, H, I, and K. The agreement between both typing techniques was 87.8%. Both methods showed that genovar E was the most predominant type. In 24.3% of the analyzed samples, mixed infections were detected. In 96.1% of these, the genovar identified by OSA was also detected using the RHM. OmpA sequencing allowed determination of six genovar types that could not be typed using RHM. The analyses of ompA nucleotide variation in the 107 clinical specimens detected ompA genovar variants with distinct ompA mutational patterns for types D2, G1, G2, and H1.

Slide culture, microscopy, antifungal drug susceptibility, intersimple sequence repeat analysis, and amplification and sequencing of internal transcribed spacer regions were performed. Yeast strains were recovered from all waste workers' sites, including professional clothes, and from waste. Antifungal susceptibility testing demonstrated that some yeast recovered from employees and waste exhibited nonsusceptible profiles.

Diarrhea-producing enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) uses a T3SS to colonize the intestinal tract. T3S is a highly coordinated process that ensures hierarchical delivery of three classes of substrates: early (inner rod and needle subunits), middle (translocators), and late (effectors). Translocation of effectors is triggered upon host-cell contact in response to different environmental cues, such as calcium levels. The T3S substrate specificity switch from middle to late substrates in EPEC is regulated by the SepL and SepD proteins, which interact with each other and form a trimeric complex with the chaperone CesL. In this study, we investigated the link between calcium concentration and secretion regulation by the gatekeeper SepL. We found that calcium depletion promotes late substrate secretion in a translocon-independent manner. Furthermore, the stability, formation, and subcellular localization of the SepL\/SepD\/CesL regulatory complex were not affected by the absence of calcium. In addition, we demonstrate that SepL interacts in a calcium-independent manner with the major export gate component EscV, which in turn interacts with both middle and late secretion substrates, providing a docking site for T3S. These results suggest that EscV serves as a binding platform for both the SepL regulatory protein and secreted substrates during the ordered assembly of the T3SS.","646":null,"647":"Rhizobium sp. str.

The aioXSR operon is upregulated in stationary phase but not by the presence of arsenite in the growth medium. The two transcription start sites upstream of aioX were determined which led to the identification of two promoters, the housekeeping promoter RpoD and the growth-phase-dependent promoter RpoE2. Promoter-lacZ fusions confirmed their constitutive and stationary phase expressions. The involvement of the NT-26 sigma factor RpoE2 in acting on the NT-26 RpoE2 promoter was confirmed in vivo in Escherichia coli, which lacks a rpoE2 homolog, using a strain carrying both the promoter-lacZ fusion and the NT-26 rpoE2 gene. An in silico approach was used to search for other RpoE2 promoters and AioR-binding motifs and led to the identification of other genes that could be regulated by these proteins including those involved in quorum sensing, chemotaxis, and motility expanding the signaling networks important for the microbial metabolism of arsenite.","648":null,"649":null,"650":"Cryptococcus neoformans is an important opportunistic fungal pathogen in humans. Recent studies have demonstrated that metals are critical factors for the regulation of fungal virulence in hosts.

We identified three Mg transporters in C. neoformans: Mgt1, Mgt2, and Mgt3. While we could not detect a Mg2+ -related growth phenotype in mgt1 and mgt3 knockout strains, a GAL7p-Mgt2 strain showed significant Mg-dependent growth defects in the presence of glucose. Further analysis demonstrated that MGT2 is a homolog of MNR2 in Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which is localized to the vacuolar membrane and participates in intracellular Mg transport. Interestingly, a transcriptome analysis showed that Mgt2 influenced the expression of 19 genes, which were independent of Mg2+ . We showed that melanin synthesis in C. neoformans required Mg2+ and Mgt2, and that capsule production was negatively regulated by Mg2+ and Mgt2.

The DNABII protein family includes integration host factor (IHF) and the histone-like protein HU and plays a central role in NTHI biofilm structural integrity. We demonstrated that immunological targeting of these proteins during NTHI-induced experimental OM in a chinchilla model caused rapid clearance of biofilms from the middle ear. Given the essential role of DNABII proteins in maintaining the structure of an NTHI biofilm, we investigated whether any of the other nucleoid associated proteins (NAPs) expressed by NTHI might play a similar role, thereby serving as additional target(s) for intervention. We demonstrated that although several NAPs including H-NS, CbpA, HfQ and Dps are present within the biofilm extracellular matrix, only the DNABII family of proteins is critical for the structural integrity of the biofilms formed by NTHI. We have also demonstrated that IHF and HU are located at distinct regions within the extracellular matrix of NTHI biofilms formed in vitro, indicative of independent functions of these two proteins.","652":null,"653":null,"654":null,"655":null,"656":null,"657":null,"658":null,"659":null,"660":"The impacts of increased flooding frequency on soil microbial communities and potential functions, in line with predicted environmental changes, were investigated in a laboratory-controlled environment.

Instead, no preferential rotation direction is observed for microcolonies suggesting that their motion is due to a different physical mechanism. We propose a simple mechanical model where the microcolonies move like rafts constrained to the air-liquid interface. Finally, we observed that the microcolony growth is due to the aggregation of colliding single-swimmers, suggesting that the microcolony formation resembles a condensation process where the first nucleus originates by the collision between two single-swimmers.

To this end, we performed cocultivation experiments and measured mcyB and mcyD transcripts in M. aeruginosa using RT-qPCR. We utilized representatives from three different plankton groups: the picocyanobacterium Synechococcus elongatus, the unicellular flagellate grazer Ochromonas danica, and virioplankton from two different lakes. The presence of S. elongatus significantly increased mcyB and mcyD transcription in M. aeruginosa. Cocultivation with the mixotrophic chrysophyte O. danica did not increase the transcription of mcyB and mcyD; in fact, mcyD transcripts decreased significantly.

Using an L. lactis KF147 mutant deficient in synthesis of NrpC, a 4'-phosphopantetheinyl transferase, we found that the NRPS\/PKS system improves L. lactis during growth under oxidative conditions in Arapidopsis thaliana leaf lysate. The NRPS\/PKS system also improves tolerance of L. lactis to reactive oxygen species and specifically H2 O2 and superoxide radicals in culture medium.

In contrast, commensal and pathogenic isolates frequently express the csgD-dependent rdar morphotype semi-constitutively, also at human host body temperature. To unravel the molecular basis of temperature-independent rdar morphotype expression, biofilm components and c-di-GMP turnover proteins of seven commensal and uropathogenic E. coli isolates were analyzed. A diversity within the c-di-GMP signaling network was uncovered which suggests alteration of activity of the trigger phosphodiesterase YciR to contribute to (up)regulation of csgD expression and consequently semi-constitutive rdar morphotype development.","676":"In gram-negative bacteria, the ABC transporter LolCDE complex translocates outer membrane-specific lipoproteins (Lpp) from the inner membrane to the outer membrane. Lpp possessing aspartate (Asp) at position +2 are not translocated because it functions as a LolCDE avoidance signal. In gram-positive bacteria, lacking an outer membrane and the Lol system, Lpp are only anchored at the outer leaflet of the cytoplasmic membrane. However, the release of Lpp particularly in pathogenic or commensal species is crucial for immune modulation. Here, we provide evidence that in Staphylococcus aureus Asp at position +2 plays a role in withholding Lpp to the cytoplasmic membrane. Screening of published exoproteomic data of S. aureus revealed that Lpp mainly with Gly or Ser at position +2 were found in exoproteome, but there was no Lpp with Asp+2. The occurrence of Lpp with Asp+2 is infrequent in gram-positive bacteria. In S. aureus USA300 only seven of the 67 Lpp possess Asp+2; among them five Lpp represented Lpl lipoproteins involved in host cell invasion. Our study demonstrated that replacing the Asp+2 present in Lpl8 with a Ser enhances its release into the supernatant. However, there is no different release of Asp+2 and Ser+2 in mprF mutant that lacks the positive charge of lysyl-phosphatidylglycerol (Lys-PG). Moreover, substitution of Ser+2 by Asp in SitC (MntC) did not lead to a decreased release indicating that in staphylococci positions +3 and +4 might also be important for a tighter anchoring of Lpp. Here, we show that Asp in position +2 and adjacent amino acids contribute in tightening the anchoring of Lpp by interaction of the negative charged Asp with the positive charged Lys-PG.","677":"To address the problem of indoor fungal growth, understanding the influence of moisture conditions on the fungal colonization process is crucial. This paper explores the influence of past moisture conditions on current processes. Specifically, it studies the growth and water sorption of conidia of Penicillium rubens formed at lower water activities (ranging from 0.86 to 0.99). For the first time, dynamic vapor sorption (DVS) is applied as a tool to quantify the water sorption of conidia as a function of the water activity at conidiation. Furthermore, growth experiments on agar and gypsum substrates are reported that relate hyphal growth rates of the mycelium from pretreated conidia to the water activity at conidiation. No effect of the conidiation water activity on mycelial growth rates is found on either gypsum or agar. It is found, however, that conidia formed at lower activities have a higher dry weight and attract more water from humid air. It is shown that both phenomena can be explained by conidia from lower activities carrying higher amounts of compatible solutes, glycerol in particular. The enhanced sorption observed in this study might constitute a mechanism through which solute reserves contribute to survival during the early steps of fungal colonization.","678":"Sediment microbial communities play an important role in lake trophic status. This study determined millions of Illumina reads (16S rRNA gene amplicons) to compare the bacterial communities in moderately eutrophic, lightly eutrophic, and moderately trophic regions using a technically consistent approach. The results indicated that the sediments from moderately eutrophic and trophic lake had the higher bacterial diversity than lightly eutrophic lake. Proteobacteria was the most abundant phylum (22.7%-86.2%) across samples from three regions. The sediments from moderately eutrophic region were enriched with Chloroflexi and Nitrospirae. Alphaproteobacteria, Gammaproteobacteria, and Bacteroidetes were enriched in the sediments from lightly eutrophic lake. The sediments from moderately trophic lake contained a high abundance of Acidobacteria and Deltaproteobacteria because of the low pH of the sediments in this lake. In moderately eutrophic region, Nitrospira held an absolute predominance, while Lysobacter and Flavobacterium were the most predominant genera in lightly eutrophic region. Temperature was the main factor influencing the bacterial community in the three lakes. The bacterial communities in the sediment samples obtained from moderately eutrophic lake were associated with nutrient concentration, whereas organic matter and total nitrogen contents mainly influenced the bacterial communities in sediments obtained from lightly eutrophic lake and moderately trophic lake, respectively.","679":null,"680":null,"681":null,"682":"In this pilot study, we determined the core fecal microbiota composition and overall microbiota diversity of domesticated herbivorous animals of three digestion types: hindgut fermenters, ruminants, and monogastrics. The 42 animals representing 10 animal species were housed on a single farm in Ireland and all the large herbivores consumed similar feed, harmonizing two of the environmental factors that influence the microbiota. Similar to other mammals, the fecal microbiota of all these animals was dominated by the Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes phyla. The fecal microbiota spanning all digestion types comprised 42% of the genera identified. Host phylogeny and, to a lesser extent, digestion type determined the microbiota diversity in these domesticated herbivores. This pilot study forms a platform for future studies into the microbiota of nonbovine and nonequine domesticated herbivorous animals.","683":null,"684":null,"685":null,"686":"Nunamycin and nunapeptin are two antimicrobial cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) produced by Pseudomonas fluorescens In5 and synthesized by nonribosomal synthetases (NRPS) located on two gene clusters designated the nun-nup regulon. Organization of the regulon is similar to clusters found in other CLP-producing pseudomonads except for the border regions where putative LuxR-type regulators are located. This study focuses on understanding the regulatory role of the LuxR-type-encoding gene nunF in CLP production of P. fluorescens In5. Functional analysis of nunF coupled with liquid chromatography-high-resolution mass spectrometry (LC-HRMS) showed that CLP biosynthesis is regulated by nunF. Quantitative real-time PCR analysis indicated that transcription of the NRPS genes catalyzing CLP production is strongly reduced when nunF is mutated indicating that nunF is part of the nun-nup regulon. Swarming and biofilm formation was reduced in a nunF knockout mutant suggesting that these CLPs may also play a role in these phenomena as observed in other pseudomonads. Fusion of the nunF promoter region to mCherry showed that nunF is strongly upregulated in response to carbon sources indicating the presence of a fungus suggesting that environmental elicitors may also influence nunF expression which upon activation regulates nunamycin and nunapeptin production required for the growth inhibition of phytopathogens.","687":"Acetohydroxyacid synthase (AHAS) is the key enzyme in the biosynthetic pathways of branched chain amino acids in bacteria. Since it does not exist in animal and plant cells, AHAS is an attractive target for developing antimicrobials and herbicides. In some bacteria, there is a single copy of AHAS, while in others there are multiple copies. Therefore, it is necessary to investigate the origin and evolutionary pathway of various AHASs in bacteria. In this study, all the available protein sequences of AHAS in bacteria were investigated, and an evolutionary model of AHAS in bacteria is proposed, according to gene structure, organization and phylogeny. Multiple copies of AHAS in some bacteria might be evolved from the single copy of AHAS, the ancestor. Gene duplication, domain deletion and horizontal gene transfer might occur during the evolution of this enzyme. The results show the biological significance of AHAS, help to understand the functions of various AHASs in bacteria, and would be useful for developing industrial production strains of branched chain amino acids or novel antimicrobials.","688":"In this survey, a total of 80 787 reads and 28 171 unique NifH protein sequences were retrieved from soil RNA. This dataset extends our knowledge about the structure and diversity of the functional diazotrophic communities in agricultural soils from Argentinean Pampas. Operational taxonomic unit (OTU)-based analyses showed that nifH phylotypes related to Geobacter and Anaeromyxobacter (44.8%), Rhizobiales (29%), Cyanobacteria (16.7%), and Verrucomicrobiales (8%) are key microbial components of N2 fixation in soils associated with no-till management and soil depth. In addition, quantification of nifH gene copies related to Geobacter and Cyanobacteria revealed that these groups are abundant in soils under maize-soybean rotation and soybean monoculture, respectively. The correlation of physicochemical soil parameters with the diazotrophic diversity and composition showed that soil stability and organic carbon might contribute to the functional signatures of particular nifH phylotypes in fields under no-till management. Because crop production relies on soil-borne microorganism's activities, such as free N2 fixation, the information provided by our study on the diazotrophic population dynamics, associated with the edaphic properties and land-use practices, represents a major contribution to gain insight into soil biology, in which functionally active components are identified.","689":"Adhesion is a key virulence factor of pathogens and can be affected by the environment. Our previously research with RNA-seq indicated that mcp, aer, cheB, and cheV might play roles in the regulation of adhesion in Vibrio alginolyticus (ND-01). In order to determine whether and how environmental factors affect adhesion through these genes, gene silencing was performed followed by quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR), RNAi, transmission electron microscopy, and adhesion, capillary, and motility assays to verify how these genes influence adhesion. Silencing these genes led to deficiencies in adhesion, chemotaxis, flagellar assembly, and motility. The expression levels of cheA, cheW, and cheY, which are important genes closely related to the functions of mcp, aer, cheV, and cheB, were significantly downregulated in all of the RNAi groups. The expression of mcp, aer, cheV, and cheB under different gradients of temperature, pH, and salinity and after starvation for various durations was also detected, which showed that these genes were sensitive to certain environmental stresses, particularly pH and starvation. Our results indicated that mcp, aer, cheB, and cheV: (1) are necessary for ND-01 adhesion; (2) play key roles in the bacterial chemotaxis pathway by controlling the expression of downstream genes; (3) might affect adhesion by impacting motility, though motility is not the only route through which adhesion is affected; and (4) contribute to the regulation of ND-01 adhesion in natural environments with different temperatures, pH levels, and salinities as well as after various starvation periods.","690":"Campylobacter jejuni\/coli infections are the leading cause of bacterial diarrheal illnesses in humans. Many epidemiological studies indicate that improperly prepared meat from chickens that carry a high load of Campylobacter in their intestinal tracts is the key source of human infections. LAB, mainly members of the Lactococcus and Lactobacillus genera, increasingly have been tested as vehicles for the delivery of heterologous bacterial or viral antigens to animal mucosal immune systems. Thus, the objective of this study was to isolate, identify, and characterize Lactobacillus spp. strains isolated from chickens bred in Poland. Their ability to decrease the level of bird gut colonization by C. jejuni strain was also analyzed. First, the influence of the different chicken rearing systems was evaluated, especially the effect of diets on the Lactobacillus species that colonize the gut of chickens. Next, selected strains were analyzed in terms of their anti-Campylobacter activity in vitro; potential probiotic traits such as adhesion properties, bile and low pH tolerance; and their ability to grow on a defined carbon source. Given that improperly prepared chicken meat is the main source of human infection by Campylobacter, the selected strains were also assessed for their ability to inhibit Campylobacter colonization in the bird's intestine. These experiments revealed enormous physiological diversity among the Lactobacillus genus strains. Altogether, our results showed that L. plantarum strains isolated from the digestive tracts of chickens bred in Poland displayed some probiotic attributes in vitro and were able to decrease the level of bird gut colonization by C. jejuni strain. This suggests that they can be employed as vectors to deliver Campylobacter immunodominant proteins to the bird's immune system to strengthen the efficacy of in ovo vaccination.","691":null,"692":null,"693":null,"694":null,"695":null,"696":null,"697":null,"698":null,"699":null,"700":"Microbes are known to withstand environmental stresses by using chromosomal toxin-antitoxin systems. MazEF is one of the most extensively studied toxin-antitoxin systems. In stressful environments, MazF toxins modulate translation by cleaving single-stranded RNAs in a sequence-specific fashion. Previously, a chromosomal gene located at DR0417 in Deinococcus radiodurans was predicted to code for a MazF endoribonuclease (MazFDR0417 ); however, its function remains unclear. In the present study, we characterized the molecular function of MazFDR0417 . Analysis of MazFDR0417 -cleaved RNA sites using modified massively parallel sequencing revealed a unique 4-nt motif, UACA, as a potential cleavage pattern. The activity of MazFDR0417 was also assessed in a real-time fluorometric assay, which revealed that MazFDR0417 strictly recognizes the unique tetrad UACA. This sequence specificity may allow D. radiodurans to alter its translation profile and survive under stressful conditions.","701":null,"702":null,"703":null,"704":"Endophytic and plant-associated bacteria were isolated from plants and rhizoplane soil of naturally grown Brachiaria grasses at International Livestock Research Institute in Nairobi, Kenya. Eighty-four bacterial strains were isolated from leaf tissues, root tissues, and rhizoplane soil on nutrient agar and 869 media. All bacterial strains were identified to the lowest possible taxonomic unit using 16S rDNA primers and were characterized for the production of Indole-3-acetic acid, hydrogen cyanide, and ACC deaminase; phosphate solubilization; siderophore production; antifungal properties; and plant biomass production. The 16S rDNA-based identification grouped these 84 bacterial strains into 3 phyla, 5 classes, 8 orders, 12 families, 16 genera, and 50 unique taxa. The four most frequently isolated genera were Pseudomonas (23), Pantoea (17), Acinetobacter (9), and Enterobacter (8). The functional characterization of these strains revealed that 41 of 84 strains had a minimum of three plant beneficial properties. Inoculation of maize seedlings with Acinetobacter spp., Microbacterium spp., Pectobacterium spp., Pseudomonas spp., and Enterobacter spp. showed positive effects on seedling biomass production. The ability of Brachiaria grasses to host genetically diverse bacteria, many of them with multiple plant growth-promoting attributes, might have contributed to high biomass production and adaptation of Brachiaria grasses to drought and low fertility soils.","705":"Cyclic lipopeptides (CLPs) are synthesized by nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPS), which are often flanked by LuxR-type transcriptional regulators. Pseudomonas sp. CMR12a, an effective biocontrol strain, produces two different classes of CLPs namely sessilins and orfamides. The orfamide biosynthesis gene cluster is flanked up- and downstream by LuxR-type regulatory genes designated ofaR1 and ofaR2, respectively, whereas the sessilin biosynthesis gene cluster has one LuxR-type regulatory gene which is situated upstream of the cluster and is designated sesR. Our study investigated the role of these three regulators in the biosynthesis of orfamides and sessilins. Phylogenetic analyses positioned OfaR1 and OfaR2 with LuxR regulatory proteins of similar orfamide-producing Pseudomonas strains and the SesR with that of the tolaasin producer, Pseudomonas tolaasii. LC-ESI-MS analyses revealed that sessilins and orfamides are coproduced and that production starts in the late exponential phase. However, sessilins are secreted earlier and in large amounts, while orfamides are predominantly retained in the cell. Deletion mutants in ofaR1 and ofaR2 lost the capacity to produce both orfamides and sessilins, whereas the sesR mutant showed no clear phenotype. Additionally, RT-PCR analysis showed that in the sessilin cluster, a mutation in either ofaR1 or ofaR2 led to weaker transcripts of the biosynthesis genes, sesABC, and putative transporter genes, macA1B1. In the orfamide cluster, mainly the biosynthesis genes ofaBC were affected, while the first biosynthesis gene ofaA and putative macA2B2 transport genes were still transcribed. A mutation in either ofaR1, ofaR2, or sesR genes did not abolish the transcription of any of the other two.","706":null,"707":null,"708":null,"709":"Aromatic hydrocarbons (AH), such as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, are compounds largely found in nature. Aromatic-ring-hydroxylating dioxygenases (ARHD) are proteins involved in AH degradation pathways. We used ARHD functional genes from an oil-impacted mangrove area and compared their diversity with other sites around the world to understand the ARHD biogeographic distribution patterns. For this, a comprehensive database was established with 166 operational protein families (OPFs) from 1,758 gene sequences obtained from 15 different sites worldwide, of which twelve are already published studies and three are unpublished. Based on a deduced ARHD peptide sequences consensus phylogeny, we examined trends and divergences in the sequence phylogenetic clustering from the different sites. The taxonomic affiliation of the OPF revealed that Pseudomonas, Streptomyces, Variovorax, Bordetella and Rhodococcus were the five most abundant genera, considering all sites. The functional diversity analysis showed the enzymatic prevalence of benzene 1,2-dioxygenase, 3-phenylpropionate dioxygenase and naphthalene 1,2-dioxygenase, in addition to 10.98% of undefined category ARHDs. The ARHD gene correlation analysis among different sites was essentially important to gain insights on spatial distribution patterns, genetic congruence and ecological coherence of the bacterial groups found. This work revealed the genetic potential from the mangrove sediment for AH biodegradation and a considerable evolutionary proximity among the dioxygenase OPFs found in Antarctica and South America sites, in addition to high level of endemism in each continental region.","710":"The biological nitrogen cycle is driven by a plethora of reactions transforming nitrogen compounds between various redox states. Here, we investigated the metagenomic potential for nitrogen cycle of the in situ microbial community in an oligotrophic, brackish environment of the Bothnian Sea sediment. Total DNA from three sediment depths was isolated and sequenced. The characterization of the total community was performed based on 16S rRNA gene inventory using SILVA database as reference. The diversity of diagnostic functional genes coding for nitrate reductases (napA;narG), nitrite:nitrate oxidoreductase (nxrA), nitrite reductases (nirK;nirS;nrfA), nitric oxide reductase (nor), nitrous oxide reductase (nosZ), hydrazine synthase (hzsA), ammonia monooxygenase (amoA), hydroxylamine oxidoreductase (hao), and nitrogenase (nifH) was analyzed by blastx against curated reference databases. In addition, Polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based amplification was performed on the hzsA gene of anammox bacteria. Our results reveal high genomic potential for full denitrification to N2 , but minor importance of anaerobic ammonium oxidation and dissimilatory nitrite reduction to ammonium. Genomic potential for aerobic ammonia oxidation was dominated by Thaumarchaeota. A higher diversity of anammox bacteria was detected in metagenomes than with PCR-based technique. The results reveal the importance of various N-cycle driving processes and highlight the advantage of metagenomics in detection of novel microbial key players.","711":null,"712":"In many gram positive bacteria, horizontal transfer and virulence are regulated by peptide-mediated cell-cell signaling. The heptapeptide cCF10 (C) activates conjugative transfer of the Enterococcus faecalis plasmid pCF10, whereas the iCF10 (I) peptide inhibits transfer. Both peptides bind to the same domain of the master transcription regulator PrgX, a repressor of transcription of the prgQ operon encoding conjugation genes. We show that repression of prgQ by PrgX tetramers requires formation of a pCF10 DNA loop where each of two PrgX DNA-binding sites is occupied by a dimer. I binding to PrgX enhances prgQ repression, while C binding has the opposite effect. Previous models suggested that differential effects of these two peptides on the PrgX oligomerization state accounted for their distinct functions. Our new results demonstrate that both peptides have similar, high-binding affinity for PrgX, and that both peptides actually promote formation of PrgX tetramers with higher DNA-binding affinity than Apo-PrgX. We propose that differences in repression ability of PrgX\/peptide complexes result from subtle differences in the structures of DNA-bound PrgX\/peptide complexes. Changes in the induction state of a donor cell likely results from replacement of one type of DNA-bound peptide\/PrgX tetramer with the other.","713":null,"714":null,"715":null,"716":"Biofilm formation is a major cause of reduced paper quality and increased down time during paper manufacturing. This study uses Illumina next-generation sequencing to identify the microbial populations causing quality issues due to their presence in biofilms and slimes. The paper defects investigated contained traces of the films and\/or slime of mainly two genera, Tepidimonas and Chryseobacterium. The Tepidimonas spp. found contributed on average 68% to the total bacterial population. Both genera have been described previously to be associated with biofilms in paper mills. There was indication that Tepidimonas spp. were present as compact biofilm in the head box of one paper machine and was filtered out by the paper web during production. On the other hand Tepidimonas spp. were also present to a large extent in the press and white waters of two nonproblematic paper machines. Therefore, the mere presence of a known biofilm producer alone is not sufficient to cause slimes and therefore paper defects and other critical factors are additionally at play. For instance, we identified Acidovorax sp., which is an early colonizer of paper machines, exhibiting the ability to form extracellular DNA matrices for attachment and biofilm formation.","717":null,"718":"Sporulation in Bacillus subtilis is induced upon starvation. In a widely accepted model, an N-terminal \"sensor\" domain of the major sporulation kinase KinA recognizes a hypothetical starvation signal(s) and autophosphorylates a histidine residue to activate the master regulator Spo0A via a multicomponent phosphorelay. However, to date no confirmed signal has been found. Here, we demonstrated that PAS-A, the most N-terminal of the three PAS domains (PAS-ABC), is dispensable for the activity, contrary to a previous report. Our data indicated that the autokinase activity is dependent on the formation of a functional tetramer, which is mediated by, at least, PAS-B and PAS-C. Additionally, we ruled out the previously proposed notion that NAD+ \/NADH ratio controls KinA activity through the PAS-A domain by demonstrating that the cofactors show no effects on the kinase activity in vitro. In support of these data, we found that the cofactors exist in approximately 1000-fold excess of KinA in the cell and the cofactors' ratio does not change significantly during growth and sporulation, suggesting that changes in the cofactor ratio might not play a role in controlling KinA activity. These data may refute the widely-held belief that the activity of KinA is regulated in response to an unknown starvation signal(s).","719":null,"720":null,"721":null,"722":"In soil, bioavailable inorganic orthophosphate is found at low concentrations and thus limits biological growth. To overcome this phosphorus scarcity, plants and bacteria secrete numerous enzymes, namely acid and alkaline phosphatases, which cleave orthophosphate from various organic phosphorus substrates. Using profile hidden Markov modeling approaches, we investigated the abundance of various non specific phosphatases, both acid and alkaline, in metagenomes retrieved from soils with contrasting pH regimes. This analysis uncovered a marked reduction in the abundance and diversity of various alkaline phosphatases in low-pH soils that was not counterbalanced by an increase in acid phosphatases. Furthermore, it was also discovered that only half of the bacterial strains from different phyla deposited in the Integrated Microbial Genomes database harbor alkaline phosphatases. Taken together, our data suggests that these 'phosphatase lacking' isolates likely increase in low-pH soils and future research should ascertain how these bacteria overcome phosphorus scarcity.","723":"Increasing antibiotic resistances of numerous pathogens mean that myxobacteria, well known producers of new antibiotics, are becoming more and more interesting. More than 100 secondary metabolites, most of them with bioactivity, were described from the order Myxococcales. Especially new myxobacterial genera and species turned out to be reliable sources for novel antibiotics and can be isolated from uncommon neglected habitats like, for example, acidic soils. Almost nothing is known about the diversity of myxobacteria in moors, except some information from cultivation studies of the 1970s. Therefore, we evaluated the myxobacterial community composition of acidic high moor and fen both with cultivation-independent 16S rRNA clone bank analysis and with cultivation. Phylogenetic analyses of clone sequences revealed a great potential of undescribed myxobacteria in high moor and fen, whereby all sequences represent unknown taxa and were detected exclusively by cultivation-independent analyses. However, many clones were assigned to sequences from other cultivation-independent studies of eubacterial diversity in acidic habitats. Cultivation revealed different strains exclusively from the genus Corallococcus. Our study shows that the neglected habitat moor is a promising source and of high interest with regard to the cultivation of prospective new bioactive secondary metabolite producing myxobacteria.","724":null,"725":"The extreme radiation resistance of Deinococcus bacteria requires the radiation-stimulated cleavage of protein DdrO by a specific metalloprotease called IrrE. DdrO is the repressor of a predicted radiation\/desiccation response (RDR) regulon, composed of radiation-induced genes having a conserved DNA motif (RDRM) in their promoter regions. Here, we showed that addition of zinc ions to purified apo-IrrE, and short exposure of Deinococcus cells to zinc ions, resulted in cleavage of DdrO in vitro and in vivo, respectively. Binding of IrrE to RDRM-containing DNA or interaction of IrrE with DNA-bound DdrO was not observed. The data are in line with IrrE being a zinc peptidase, and indicate that increased zinc availability, caused by oxidative stress, triggers the in vivo cleavage of DdrO unbound to DNA. Transcriptomics and proteomics of Deinococcus deserti confirmed the IrrE-dependent regulation of predicted RDR regulon genes and also revealed additional members of this regulon. Comparative analysis showed that the RDR regulon is largely well conserved in Deinococcus species, but also showed diversity in the regulon composition. Notably, several RDR genes with an important role in radiation resistance in Deinococcus radiodurans, for example pprA, are not conserved in some other radiation-resistant Deinococcus species.","726":null,"727":null,"728":null,"729":null,"730":null,"731":"Leishmania spp. are protozoan parasites that are transmitted by sandfly vectors during blood sucking to vertebrate hosts and cause a spectrum of diseases called leishmaniases. It has been demonstrated that host cholesterol plays an important role during Leishmania infection. Nevertheless, little is known about the intracellular distribution of this lipid early after internalization of the parasite. Here, pulse-chase experiments with radiolabeled cholesteryl esterified to fatty acids bound to low-density lipoproteins indicated that retention of this source of cholesterol is increased in parasite-containing subcellular fractions, while uptake is unaffected. This is correlated with a reduction or absence of detectable NPC1 (Niemann-Pick disease, type C1), a protein responsible for cholesterol efflux from endocytic compartments, in the Leishmania mexicana habitat and infected cells. Filipin staining revealed a halo around parasites within parasitophorous vacuoles (PV) likely representing free cholesterol accumulation. Labeling of host cell membranous cholesterol by fluorescent cholesterol species before infection revealed that this pool is also trafficked to the PV but becomes incorporated into the parasites' membranes and seems not to contribute to the halo detected by filipin. This cholesterol sequestration happened early after infection and was functionally significant as it correlated with the upregulation of mRNA-encoding proteins required for cholesterol biosynthesis. Thus, sequestration of cholesterol by Leishmania amastigotes early after infection provides a basis to understand perturbation of cholesterol-dependent processes in macrophages that were shown previously by others to be necessary for their proper function in innate and adaptive immune responses.","732":null,"733":null,"734":null,"735":null,"736":null,"737":null,"738":null,"739":null,"740":null,"741":null,"742":null,"743":null,"744":null,"745":null,"746":"The ubiquitous cytoplasmic membrane copper transporting P1B-1 and P1B-3 -type ATPases pump out Cu+ and Cu2+ , respectively, to prevent cytoplasmic accumulation and avoid toxicity. The presence of five copies of Cu-ATPases in the symbiotic nitrogen-fixing bacteria Sinorhizobium meliloti is remarkable; it is the largest number of Cu+ -transporters in a bacterial genome reported to date. Since the prevalence of multiple Cu-ATPases in members of the Rhizobiales order is unknown, we performed an in silico analysis to understand the occurrence, diversity and evolution of Cu+ -ATPases in members of the Rhizobiales order. Multiple copies of Cu-ATPase coding genes (2-8) were detected in 45 of the 53 analyzed genomes. The diversity inferred from a maximum-likelihood (ML) phylogenetic analysis classified Cu-ATPases into four monophyletic groups. Each group contained additional subtypes, based on the presence of conserved motifs. This novel phylogeny redefines the current classification, where they are divided into two subtypes (P1B-1 and P1B-3 ). Horizontal gene transfer (HGT) as well as the evolutionary dynamic of plasmid-borne genes may have played an important role in the functional diversification of Cu-ATPases. Homologous cytoplasmic and periplasmic Cu+ -chaperones, CopZ, and CusF, that integrate a CopZ-CopA-CusF tripartite efflux system in gamma-proteobacteria and archeae, were found in 19 of the 53 surveyed genomes of the Rhizobiales. This result strongly suggests a high divergence of CopZ and CusF homologs, or the existence of unexplored proteins involved in cellular copper transport.","747":"Metagenomics approaches and recent improvements in the next-generation sequencing methods, have become a method of choice in establishing a microbial population structure. Many commercial soil DNA extraction kits are available and due to their efficiency they are replacing traditional extraction protocols. However, differences in the physicochemical properties of soil samples require optimization of DNA extraction techniques for each sample separately. The aim of this study was to compare the efficiency, quality, and diversity of genetic material extracted with the use of commonly used kits. The comparative analysis of microbial community composition, displayed differences in microbial community structure depending on which kit was used. Statistical analysis indicated significant differences in recovery of the genetic material for 24 out of 32 analyzed phyla, and the most pronounced differences were seen for Actinobacteria. Also, diversity indexes and reproducibility of DNA extraction with the use of a given kit, varied among the tested methods. As the extraction protocol may influence the apparent structure of a microbial population, at the beginning of each project many extraction kits should be tested in order to choose one that would yield the most representative results and present the closest view to the actual structure of microbial population.","748":"Thiocyanate (SCN- ) is a toxic compound that forms when cyanide (CN- ), used to recover gold, reacts with sulfur species. SCN- -degrading microbial communities have been studied, using bioreactors fed synthetic wastewater. The inclusion of suspended solids in the form of mineral tailings, during the development of the acclimatized microbial consortium, led to the selection of an active planktonic microbial community. Preliminary analysis of the community composition revealed reduced microbial diversity relative to the laboratory-based reactors operated without suspended solids. Despite minor upsets during the acclimation period, the SCN- degradation performance was largely unchanged under stable operating conditions. Here, we characterized the microbial community in the SCN- degrading bioreactor that included solid particulate tailings and determined how it differed from the biofilm-based communities in solids-free reactor systems inoculated from the same source. Genome-based analysis revealed that the presence of solids decreased microbial diversity, selected for different strains, suppressed growth of thiobacilli inferred to be primarily responsible for SCN- degradation, and promoted growth of Trupera, an organism not detected in the reactors without solids. In the solids reactor community, heterotrophy and aerobic respiration represent the dominant metabolisms. Many organisms have genes for denitrification and sulfur oxidation, but only one Thiobacillus sp. in the solids reactor has SCN- degradation genes. The presence of the solids prevented floc and biofilm formation, leading to the observed reduced microbial diversity. Collectively the presence of the solids and lack of biofilm community may result in a process with reduced resilience to process perturbations, including fluctuations in the influent composition and pH. The results from this investigation have provided novel insights into the community composition of this industrially relevant community, giving potential for improved process control and operation through ongoing process monitoring.","749":null,"750":null,"751":"Sediment bacterial community is the main driving force for nutrient cycling and energy transfer in aquatic ecosystem. A thorough understanding of the community's spatiotemporal variation is critical for us to understand the mechanisms of cycling and transfer. Here, we investigated the sediment bacterial community structures and their relations with environmental factors, using Lake Taihu as a model system to explore the dependence of biodiversity upon trophic level and seasonality. To combat the limitations of conventional techniques, we employed Illumina MiSeq Sequencing and LeFSe cladogram to obtain a more comprehensive view of the bacterial taxonomy and their variations of spatiotemporal distribution. The results uncovered a 1,000-fold increase in the total amount of sequences harvested and a reverse relationship between trophic level and the bacterial diversity in most seasons of a year. A total of 65 phyla, 221 classes, 436 orders, 624 families, and 864 genera were identified in the study area. Delta-proteobacteria and gamma-proteobacteria prevailed in spring\/summer and winter, respectively, regardless trophic conditions; meanwhile, the two classes dominated in the eutrophication and mesotrophication lake regions, respectively, but exclusively in the Fall. For LEfSe analysis, bacterial taxon that showed the strongest seasonal or spatial variation, majority had the highest abundance in spring\/summer or medium eutrophication region, respectively. Pearson's correlation analysis indicated that 5 major phyla and 18 sub-phylogenetic groups showed significant correlation with trophic status. Canonical correspondence analysis further revealed that porewater NH4+ -N as well as sediment TOM and NOx -N are likely the dominant environmental factors affecting bacterial community compositions.","752":null,"753":null,"754":"Gut microbes of animals play critical roles in processes such as digestion and immunity. Therefore, identifying gut microbes will shed light on understanding the annual life of animal species, particularly those that are threatened or endangered. In the present study, we conducted nucleotide sequence analyses of the 16S rRNA genes of gut microbiome of the hooded cranes (Grus monacha) wintering at Shengjin Lake, China, by Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology. We acquired 503,398 high-quality sequences and 785 operational taxonomic units (OTUs) from 15 fecal samples from different cranes, representing 22 phyla that were dominated by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, and Actinobacteria. A total of 305 genera were identified that were dominated by Clostridium, Lysinibacillus, and Enterobacter. The core gut microbiome comprised 26 genera, including many probiotic species such as Clostridium, Bacillus, Cellulosilyticum, and Cellulomonas that could catabolize cellulose. The findings reported here contribute to our knowledge of the microbiology of hooded cranes and will likely advance efforts to protect waterbirds that inhabit Shengjin Lake Reserve during winter.","755":"Like most bacteria, Shigella must maintain a precise balance between the necessity and toxicity of iron; a balance that is achieved, at least in part, by regulating the production of bacterial iron acquisition systems in response to specific environmental signals. Using the Shigella heme utilization (Shu) system, S. dysenteriae is able to acquire iron from heme, a potentially rich source of nutritional iron within the otherwise iron-limited environment of the human host. Investigations presented within reveal two distinct molecular mechanisms underlying previously uncharacterized transcriptional and translational regulation of shuT, a gene encoding the periplasmic-binding component of the Shu system. While shuT transcription is regulated in response to iron availability via a process dependent upon the global regulator Fur and a Fur-binding site located immediately downstream of the promoter, shuT translation is regulated in response to environmental temperature via the activity of an RNA thermometer located within the 5' untranslated region of the gene. Such complex regulation likely increases the fitness of S. dysenteriae by ensuring maximal ShuT production when the pathogen is within the iron-limited and relatively warm environment of the infected host, the only environment in which heme will be encountered as a potential source of essential iron.","756":null,"757":null,"758":null,"759":null,"760":null,"761":"Two-component signal transduction constitutes the predominant strategy used by bacteria to adapt to fluctuating environments. The KdpD\/KdpE system is one of the most widespread, and is crucial for K+ homeostasis. In Escherichia coli, the histidine kinase KdpD senses K+ availability, whereas the response regulator KdpE activates synthesis of the high-affinity K+ uptake system KdpFABC. Here we show that, in the absence of KdpD, kdpFABC expression can be activated via phosphorylation of KdpE by the histidine kinase PhoR. PhoR and its cognate response regulator PhoB comprise a phosphate-responsive two-component system, which senses phosphate limitation indirectly through the phosphate transporter PstCAB and its accessory protein PhoU. In vivo two-hybrid interaction studies based on the bacterial adenylate cyclase reveal pairwise interactions between KdpD, PhoR, and PhoU. Finally, we demonstrate that cross-regulation between the kdpFABC and pstSCAB operons occurs in both directions under simultaneous K+ and phosphate limitation, both in vitro and in vivo. This study for the first time demonstrates direct coupling between intracellular K+ and phosphate homeostasis and provides a mechanism for fine-tuning of the balance between positively and negatively charged ions in the bacterial cell.","762":null,"763":null,"764":null,"765":null,"766":null,"767":null,"768":"Bar-headed goose (Anser indicus), a species endemic to Asia, has become one of the most popular species in recent years for rare bird breeding industries in several provinces of China. There has been no information on the gut metagenome configuration in both wild and artificially reared Bar-headed geese, even though the importance of gut microbiome in vertebrate nutrient and energy metabolism, immune homeostasis and reproduction is widely acknowledged. In this study, metagenomic methods have been used to describe the microbial community structure and composition of functional genes associated with both wild and artificially reared Bar-headed goose. Taxonomic analyses revealed that Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria and Bacteroidetes were the four most abundant phyla in the gut of Bar-headed geese. Bacteroidetes were significantly abundant in the artificially reared group compared to wild group. Through functional profiling, we found that artificially reared Bar-headed geese had higher bacterial gene content related to carbohydrate transport and metabolism, energy metabolism and coenzyme transport, and metabolism. A comprehensive gene catalog of Bar-headed geese metagenome was built, and the metabolism of carbohydrate, amino acid, nucleotide, and energy were found to be the four most abundant categories. These results create a baseline for future Bar-headed goose microbiology research, and make an original contribution to the artificial rearing of this bird.","769":null,"770":"","771":null,"772":null,"773":null,"774":null,"775":null,"776":null,"777":"We propose an innovative, repeatable, and reliable experimental workflow to concentrate and detect environmental bacteria in drinking water using molecular techniques.

The successful applicability of the high-throughput DNA sequencing (HTS) approach was demonstrated on drinking water samples. Our results demonstrate the feasibility of our approach in high-throughput-based studies, and we suggest incorporating it in monitoring strategies to have a better representation of the microbial community.

The only known causal agent of the disease is the pinewood nematode (PWN) Bursaphelenchus xylophilus. Despite that, bacteria belonging to several different genera have been found associated with PWN and their roles in the development of PWD have been suggested. Molecular methodologies and the new era of genomics have revealed different perspectives to the problem, recognizing the manifold interactions between different organisms involved in the disease. Here, we reviewed the possible roles of nematode-carried bacteria in PWD, what could be the definition of this group of microorganisms and questioned their origin as possible endophytes, discussing their relation within the endophytic community of pine trees. The diversity of the nematode-carried bacteria and the diversity of pine tree endophytes, reported until now, is revised in detail in this review. What could signify a synergetic effect with PWN harming the plant, or what could equip bacteria with functions to control the presence of nematodes inside the tree, is outlined as two possible roles of the microbial community in the etiology of this disease. An emphasis is put on the potential revealed by the genomic data of isolated organisms in their potential activities as effective tools in PWD management.","779":"The Latrunculiidae are a family of cold water sponges known for their production of bioactive pyrroloiminoquinone alkaloids. Previously it was shown that the bacterial community associated with a Tsitsikamma sponge species comprises unusual bacterial taxa and is dominated by a novel Betaproteobacterium. Here, we have characterized the bacterial communities associated with six latrunculid species representing three genera (Tsitsikamma, Cyclacanthia, and Latrunculia) as well as a Mycale species, collected from Algoa Bay on the South African southeast coast. The bacterial communities of all seven sponge species were dominated by a single Betaproteobacterium operational taxonomic unit (OTU0.03 ), while a second OTU0.03 was dominant in the Mycale sp. The Betaproteobacteria OTUs from the different latrunculid sponges are closely related and their phylogenetic relationship follows that of their hosts. We propose that the latrunculid Betaproteobacteria OTUs are members of a specialized group of sponge symbionts that may have coevolved with their hosts. A single dominant Spirochaetae OTU0.03 was present in the Tsitsikamma and Cyclacanthia sponge species, but absent from the Latrunculia and Mycale sponges. This study sheds new light on the interactions between latrunculid sponges and their bacterial communities and may point to the potential involvement of dominant symbionts in the biosynthesis of the bioactive secondary metabolites.","780":null,"781":"Colony opacity phase variation in Acinetobacter baumannii strain AB5075 is regulated by a reversible high-frequency switch. Transposon mutagenesis was used to generate mutations that decreased the opaque to translucent switch and a gene encoding a predicted periplasmic membrane fusion component of a resistance-nodulation-cell division (RND)-type efflux system was isolated. This gene was designated arpA and immediately downstream was a gene designated arpB that encodes a predicted membrane transporter of RND-type systems. A nonpolar, in-frame deletion in arpA resulted in a 70-fold decrease in the opaque to translucent switch. An arpB::Tc mutant exhibited a 769-fold decrease in the opaque to translucent switch. However, the translucent to opaque switch was largely unchanged in both the arpA and arpB mutants. The arpA and arpB mutants also exhibited increased surface motility in the opaque form and the arpB mutant exhibited increased susceptibility to aminoglycosides. The arpA and arpB mutants were both attenuated in a Galleria mellonella model of virulence. A divergently transcribed TetR-type regulator ArpR was capable of repressing the arpAB operon when this TetR regulator was overexpressed. The arpR gene was also involved in regulating the opaque to translucent switch as an in-frame arpR mutation decreased this switch by 1,916-fold.","782":"Effect of ecological variables on community assembly of heterotrophic bacteria at eight full-scale and two pilot-scale activated sludge wastewater treatment plants (AS-WWTPs) were explored by pyrosequencing of 16S rRNA gene amplicons. In total, 39 samples covering a range of abiotic factors spread over space and time were analyzed. A core bacterial community of 24 families detected in at least six of the eight AS-WWTPs was defined. In addition to the core families, plant-specific families (observed at &lt;50% AS-WWTPs) were found to be also important in the community structure. Observed beta diversity was partitioned with respect to ecological variables. Specifically, the following variables were considered: influent wastewater characteristics, season (winter vs. summer), process operations (conventional, oxidation ditch, and sequence batch reactor), reactor sizes (pilot-scale vs. full-scale reactors), chemical stresses defined by ozonation of return activated sludge, interannual variation, and geographical locations. Among the assessed variables, influent wastewater characteristics and geographical locations contributed more in explaining the differences between AS-WWTP bacterial communities with a maximum of approximately 26% of the observed variations.

Yet, little is known about the composition of these microbial communities. Therefore, the aim of this study was to assess the microbial community composition over two seasons (winter and summer) in activated sludge from well-operating textile wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in comparison with municipal WWTPs, and to explain observed differences by environmental variables. 454-pyrosequencing generated 160 archaeal and 1645 bacterial species-level Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs), with lower observed richness in activated sludge from textile WWTPs compared to municipal WWTPs. The bacterial phyla Planctomycetes, Chloroflexi, Chlorobi, and Acidobacteria were more abundant in activated sludge samples from textile WWTPs, together with archaeal members of Thaumarchaeota. Nonmetric multidimensional scaling analysis of the microbial communities showed that microbial communities from textile and municipal WWTPs were significantly different, with a seasonal effect on archaea. Nitrifying and denitrifying bacteria as well as phosphate-accumulation bacteria were more abundant in municipal WWTPs, while sulfate-reducing bacteria were almost only detected in textile WWTPs. Additionally, microbial communities from textile WWTPs were more dissimilar than those of municipal WWTPs, possibly due to a wider diversity in environmental stresses to which microbial communities in textile WWTPs are subjected to. High salinity, high organic loads, and a higher water temperature were important potential variables driving the microbial community composition in textile WWTPs. This study provides a general view on the composition of microbial communities in activated sludge of textile WWTPs, and may provide novel insights for identifying key players performing important functions in the purification of textile wastewaters.","788":"Endophytic bacterial communities play a key role in promoting plant growth and combating plant diseases. However, little is known about their population dynamics in plant tissues and bulk soil, especially in transgenic crops. This study investigated the colonization of transgenic maize harboring the Bacillus thuringiensis (Bt) cry1Ah gene by Bacillus subtilis strain B916-gfp present in plant tissues and soil. Bt and nontransgenic maize were inoculated with B916-gfp by seed soaking, or root irrigation under both laboratory greenhouse and field conditions. During the growing season, B916-gfp colonized transgenic as well as nontransgenic plants by both inoculation methods. No differences were observed in B916-gfp population size between transgenic and nontransgenic plants, except at one or two time points in the roots and stems that did not persist over the examination period. Furthermore, planting transgenic maize did not affect the number of B916-gfp in bulk soil in either laboratory or field trials. These results indicate that transgenic modification of maize with the cry1Ah gene has no influence on colonization by the endophytic bacteria B916-gfp present in the plant and in bulk soil.","789":null,"790":null,"791":"Ligninolytic extracellular enzymes, including lignin peroxidase, are topical owing to their high redox potential and prospective industrial applications. The prospective applications of lignin peroxidase span through sectors such as biorefinery, textile, energy, bioremediation, cosmetology, and dermatology industries. The litany of potentials attributed to lignin peroxidase is occasioned by its versatility in the degradation of xenobiotics and compounds with both phenolic and non-phenolic constituents. Over the years, ligninolytic enzymes have been studied however; research on lignin peroxidase seems to have been lagging when compared to other ligninolytic enzymes which are extracellular in nature including laccase and manganese peroxidase. This assertion becomes more pronounced when the application of lignin peroxidase is put into perspective. Consequently, a succinct documentation of the contemporary functionalities of lignin peroxidase and, some prospective applications of futuristic relevance has been advanced in this review. Some articulated applications include delignification of feedstock for ethanol production, textile effluent treatment and dye decolourization, coal depolymerization, treatment of hyperpigmentation, and skin-lightening through melanin oxidation. Prospective application of lignin peroxidase in skin-lightening functions through novel mechanisms, hence, it holds high value for the cosmetics sector where it may serve as suitable alternative to hydroquinone; a potent skin-lightening agent whose safety has generated lots of controversy and concern.","792":null,"793":null,"794":null,"795":null,"796":"Ectomycorrhizal fungi are an essential component of forest ecosystems, most of which can form edible and medical fruiting bodies. Although many studies have focused on the fructification of ectomycorrhizal fungi in phenology, the impact of environmental contamination, especially living garbage, on the formation of fruiting body is still unknown. A field investigation, combined with a high-throughput sequencing method, was used to study the effect of living garbage pollution on the fructification and hypogeous community structure of ectomycorrhizal fungi symbiosing with cedar (Cedrus deodara (Roxb.) G. Don). The results showed that garbage significantly altered soil abiotic and biotic properties, increasing soil urease activity, decreasing the soil exchangeable metal content and phosphatase activity, and ultimately inhibiting the formation of fruiting bodies. The pollution of garbage also changed the community structure of hypogeous ectomycorrhizal fungi where ectomycorrhizal ascomycetes dominated. In unpolluted sites, the relative abundance of ectomycorrhizal ascomycetes and basidiomycetes were almost equal. Although no fruiting bodies were observed in that soil polluted by living garbage, the sequencing result showed that various ectomycorrhizal fungi were present underground, suggesting that these taxonomic fungi had the potential to cope with adverse conditions. This study not only provided a deeper understanding of the relationship between ectomycorrhizal fungal communities and prevailing environmental conditions, but provided a new pathway for the excavation and utilization of the resource of antistress ectomycorrhizal fungi.","797":null,"798":"Wolbachia is an intracellular endosymbiont infecting most arthropod and some filarial nematode species that is vertically transmitted through the maternal lineage.

Bacterial identification and enumeration in water samples is significant as it helps to maintain safe drinking water for public consumption. Culture-based methods are laborious, time-consuming, and yield false-positive results, whereas viable but nonculturable (VBNCs) microorganisms cannot be recovered. Hence, numerous methods have been developed for rapid detection and quantification of waterborne pathogenic bacteria in water. These rapid methods can be classified into nucleic acid-based, immunology-based, and biosensor-based detection methods. This review summarizes the principle and current state of rapid methods for the monitoring and detection of waterborne bacterial pathogens. Rapid methods outlined are polymerase chain reaction (PCR), digital droplet PCR, real-time PCR, multiplex PCR, DNA microarray, Next-generation sequencing (pyrosequencing, Illumina technology and genomics), and fluorescence in situ hybridization that are categorized as nucleic acid-based methods. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and immunofluorescence are classified into immunology-based methods. Optical, electrochemical, and mass-based biosensors are grouped into biosensor-based methods. Overall, these methods are sensitive, specific, time-effective, and important in prevention and diagnosis of waterborne bacterial diseases.","802":null,"803":"In order to investigate the propionate-degrading community of agricultural biogas plants, four propionate-degrading consortia (Ap1a, N12, G12, and Wp2a) were established from different biogas plants which were fed with renewable resources.

In this work, we examined the antifungal activity of the eosinophil RNase 3 and the skin-derived RNase 7, two proteins expressed by innate cell types that are directly involved in the host defense against fungal infection. Candida albicans has been selected as a suitable working model for testing RNase activities toward a eukaryotic pathogen. We explored the distinct levels of action of both RNases on yeast by combining cell viability and membrane model assays together with protein labeling and confocal microscopy. Site-directed mutagenesis was applied to ablate either the protein active site or the key anchoring region for cell binding. This is the first integrated study that highlights the RNases' dual mechanism of action. Along with an overall membrane-destabilization process, the RNases could internalize and target cellular RNA. The data support the contribution of the enzymatic activity for the antipathogen action of both antimicrobial proteins, which can be envisaged as suitable templates for the development of novel antifungal drugs. We suggest that both human RNases work as multitasking antimicrobial proteins that provide a first line immune barrier.","809":null,"810":null,"811":null,"812":null,"813":"Changing climate is expected to alter precipitation patterns in the Arctic, with consequences for subsurface temperature and moisture conditions, community structure, and nutrient mobilization through microbial belowground processes.

Soil samples were collected weekly from mid-July to mid-September in both control and deep snow plots. Richness of ECM fungi was lower, while saprotrophic fungi was higher in increased snow depth plots relative to controls. [Correction added on 23 September 2016 after first online publication: In the preceding sentence, the richness of ECM and saprotrophic fungi were wrongly interchanged and have been fixed in this current version.] ECM fungal richness was related to soil NO3 -N, NH4 -N, and K; and saprotrophic fungi to NO3 -N and pH. Small but significant changes in the composition of saprotrophic fungi could be attributed to snow treatment and sampling time, but not so for the ECM fungi. Delayed snow melt did not influence the temporal variation in fungal communities between the treatments. Results suggest that some fungal species are favored, while others are disfavored resulting in their local extinction due to long-term changes in snow amount.

EpsE contains a unique metal-binding domain that coordinates zinc through a tetracysteine motif (CXXCX29 CXXC), which is also present in type IV pilus assembly but not retraction ATPases. Deletion of the entire domain or substitution of any of the cysteine residues that coordinate zinc completely abrogates secretion in an EpsE-deficient strain and has a dominant negative effect on secretion in the presence of wild-type EpsE. Consistent with the in vivo data, chemical depletion of zinc from purified EpsE hexamers results in loss of in vitro ATPase activity. In contrast, exchanging the residues between the two dicysteines with those from the homologous ATPase XcpR from Pseudomonas aeruginosa does not have a significant impact on EpsE. These results indicate that, although the individual residues in the metal-binding domain are generally interchangeable, zinc coordination is essential for the activity and function of EpsE.","820":"By taking advantage of the ballistoconidium-forming capabilities of members of the genus Sporobolomyces, we recovered ten isolates from deciduous tree leaves collected from Vermont and Washington, USA.

Further analysis of their physiological attributes shows that all were similarly pigmented yeasts capable of growth under aerobic and microaerophilic conditions, all were tolerant of repeated freezing and thawing, minimally tolerant to elevated temperature and desiccation, and capable of growth in liquid or on solid media containing pectin or galacturonic acid. The scientific literature on ballistoconidium-forming yeasts indicates that they are a polyphyletic group.

FtsX is an integral membrane protein and FtsE is a cytoplasmic ATPase that together structurally resemble ABC transporters. Instead of transport, FtsEX transduces signals from the cell division apparatus to stimulate PG hydrolysis by PcsB, which interacts with extracellular domains of FtsX. Structural studies of PcsB and one extracellular domain of FtsX have recently appeared, but little is known about the biochemical properties of the FtsE ATPase or the intact FtsX transducer protein. We report here purifications and characterizations of tagged FtsX and FtsE proteins. Pneumococcal FtsX-GFP-His and FtsX-His could be overexpressed in Escherichia coli without toxicity, and FtsE-His remained soluble during purification. FtsX-His dimerizes in detergent micelles and when reconstituted in phospholipid nanodiscs. FtsE-His binds an ATP analog with an affinity comparable to that of ATPase subunits of ABC transporters, and FtsE-His preparations have a low, detectable ATPase activity. However, attempts to detect complexes of purified FtsX-His, FtsE-His, and PcsB-His or coexpressed tagged FtsX and FtsE were not successful with the constructs and conditions tested so far. In working with nanodiscs, we found that PcsB-His has an affinity for charged phospholipids, mediated partly by interactions with its coiled-coil domain. Together, these findings represent first steps toward reconstituting the FtsEX:PcsB complex biochemically and provide information that may be relevant to the assembly of the complex on the surface of pneumococcal cells.","822":"Lactobacillus plantarum produces a number of antimicrobial peptides (bacteriocins) that mostly target closely related bacteria.

Accumulation of formate, and dropping extracellular pH, leads to biosynthesis of the formate hydrogenlyase (FHL) complex. FHL consists of membrane and soluble domains anchored within the inner membrane. The soluble domain comprises a [NiFe] hydrogenase and a formate dehydrogenase that link formate oxidation directly to proton reduction with the release of CO2 and H2 . Thus, the function of FHL is to oxidize excess formate at low pH. FHL subunits share identity with subunits of the respiratory Complex I. In particular, the FHL membrane domain contains subunits (HycC and HycD) that are homologs of NuoL\/M\/N and NuoH, respectively, which have been implicated in proton translocation. In this work, strain engineering and new assays demonstrate unequivocally the nonphysiological reverse activity of FHL in vivo and in vitro. Harnessing FHL to reduce CO2 to formate is biotechnologically important. Moreover, assays for both possible FHL reactions provide opportunities to explore the bioenergetics using biochemical and genetic approaches. Comprehensive mutagenesis of hycC did not identify any single amino acid residues essential for FHL operation.

The Cpx envelope stress two-component system, composed of the sensor kinase CpxA and the response regulator CpxR, is orchestrated by the periplasmic protein CpxP which detects misfolded envelope proteins and inhibits the Cpx system in unstressed cells. Using selected reaction monitoring, we observed that the amount of CpxA and CpxR, as well as their stoichiometry, are only marginally affected, but that a 10-fold excess of CpxP over CpxA is needed to switch off the Cpx system. Moreover, the relative quantification of the proteome identified not only acid stress response as a new indirect target of the Cpx system, but also suggests a general function of the Cpx system for cell wall stability.","832":null,"833":null,"834":null,"835":null,"836":null,"837":"Giardia intestinalis is an important single-celled human pathogen. Interestingly, this organism has two equal-sized transcriptionally active nuclei, each considered diploid. By evaluating condensed chromosome numbers and visualizing homologous chromosomes by fluorescent in situ hybridization, we determined that the Giardia cells are constitutively aneuploid. We observed karyotype inter-and intra-population heterogeneity in eight cell lines from two clinical isolates, suggesting constant karyotype evolution during in vitro cultivation. High levels of chromosomal instability and frequent mitotic missegregations observed in four cell lines correlated with a proliferative disadvantage and growth retardation. Other cell lines, although derived from the same clinical isolate, revealed a stable yet aneuploid karyotype. We suggest that both chromatid missegregations and structural rearrangements contribute to shaping the Giardia genome, leading to whole-chromosome aneuploidy, unequal gene distribution, and a genomic divergence of the two nuclei within one cell. Aneuploidy in Giardia is further propagated without p53-mediated cell cycle arrest and might have been a key mechanism in generating the genetic diversity of this human pathogen.","838":"Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPRs) are part of an acquired bacterial immune system that functions as a barrier to exogenous genetic elements. Since naturalized Escherichia coli are likely to encounter different genetic elements in aquatic environments compared to enteric strains, we hypothesized that such differences would be reflected within the hypervariable CRISPR alleles of these two populations. Comparison of CRISPR1 alleles from naturalized and fecal phylogroup B1 E. coli strains revealed that the alleles could be categorized into four major distinct groups (designated G6-G9), and all four allele groups were found among naturalized strains and fecal strains. The distribution of CRIPSR G6 and G8 alleles was similar among strains of both ecotypes, while naturalized strains tended to have CRISPR G7 alleles rather than G9 alleles. Since CRISPR G7 alleles were not specific to naturalized strains, they, however, would not be useful as a marker for identifying naturalized strains. Notably, CRISPR alleles from naturalized and fecal strains also had similar spacer repertoires. This indicates a shared history of encounter with mobile genetic elements and suggests that the two populations were derived from common ancestors.","839":null,"840":null,"841":null,"842":"Toxin\/antitoxin (TA) systems are prevalent in most bacterial and archaeal genomes, and one of the emerging physiological roles of TA systems is to help regulate pathogenicity. Although TA systems have been studied in several model organisms, few studies have investigated the role of TA systems in pseudomonads. Here, we demonstrate that the previously uncharacterized proteins HigB (unannotated) and HigA (PA4674) of Pseudomonas aeruginosa PA14 form a type II TA system in which antitoxin HigA masks the RNase activity of toxin HigB through direct binding. Furthermore, toxin HigB reduces production of the virulence factors pyochelin, pyocyanin, swarming, and biofilm formation; hence, this system affects the pathogencity of this strain in a manner that has not been demonstrated previously for TA systems.","843":"Escherichia coli strains are classified into four main phylogenetic groups (A, B1, B2, and D) and strains of these phylogroups differ in a number of characteristics. This study tested whether human fecal E. coli isolates belonging to different phylogroups differ in prevalence of bacteriocinogenic isolates and prevalence of individual bacteriocinogenic determinants. A set of 1283 fecal E. coli isolates from patients with different diseases was tested for the presence of DNA regions allowing classification into E. coli phylogroups and for the ability to produce bacteriocins (23 colicins and 7 microcins). Of the isolates tested, the most common was phylogroup B2 (38.3%) followed by phylogroups A (28.3%), D (26.3%) and B1 (7.2%). Altogether, 695 bacteriocin producers were identified representing 54.2% of all tested isolates. The highest prevalence of bacteriocin producers was found in group B2 (60.3%) and the lowest in group B1 (44.6%). Determinants encoding colicins E1, Ia, and microcin mV were most common in phylogroup A, determinants encoding microcins mM and mH47 were most common in phylogroup B2, and determinant encoding mB17 was most common in phylogroup D. The highest prevalence of bacteriocinogeny was found in phylogroup B2, suggesting that bacteriocinogeny and especially the synthesis of microcins was associated with virulent and resident E. coli strains.","844":null,"845":"Betaproteobacteria were the most common isolates from the water-filled tank of a Costa Rican bromeliad. Isolates included eight species from the orders Neisseriales and Burkholderiales, with close relatives recovered previously from tropical soils, wetlands, freshwater, or in association with plants. Compared to close relatives, the isolates displayed high temperature and comparatively low pH optima, reflecting the tropical, acidic nature of the bromeliad tank. Bromeliad-associated bacteria most closely related to Chromobacterium, Herbaspirillum, and Aquitalea were all isolated exclusively at pH 6, while Ralstonia, Cupriavidus, and three species of Burkholderia were isolated mostly at pH 4. Activity profiles for the isolates suggest pervasive capabilities for the breakdown of plant-sourced organics, including d-galacturonic acid, mannitol, d-xylose, and l-phenylalanine, also reflecting a niche dominated by decomposition of leaves from the overlying canopy, which become entrained in the tanks. Metabolic activity profiles were overlapping between the Burkholderiales, isolated at pH 4, and the Neisseriales, isolated at pH 6, suggesting that plant material decomposition, which is presumably the underlying process sustaining the tank community and possibly the plant itself, occurs in the tanks at both pH extremes. These results suggest that bromeliad-associated betaproteobacteria may play an important role in the cycling of carbon in this unusual aquatic habitat.","846":null,"847":null,"848":null,"849":"Chemical flocculants are generally used in drinking water and wastewater treatment due to their efficacy and cost effectiveness. However, the question of their toxicity to human health and environmental pollution has been a major concern. In this article, we review the application of some chemical flocculants utilized in water treatment, and bioflocculants as a potential alternative to these chemical flocculants. To the best of our knowledge, there is no report in the literature that provides an up-to-date review of the relevant literature on both chemical flocculants and bioflocculants in one paper. As a result, this review paper comprehensively discussed the various chemical flocculants used in water treatment, including their advantages and disadvantages. It also gave insights into bioflocculants production, challenges, various factors influencing their flocculating efficiency and their industrial applications, as well as future research directions including improvement of bioflocculants yields and flocculating activity, and production of cation-independent bioflocculants. The molecular biology and synthesis of bioflocculants are also discussed. ","850":"S-type pyocins are bacteriocins produced by Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates to antagonize or kill other strains of the same species. They have a modular organization comprising a receptor-binding domain recognizing a surface constituent of the target bacterium, a domain for translocation through the periplasm, and a killing or toxic domain with DNase, tRNase, or pore-forming activity. Pyocins S2, S3, S4, and S5 recognize TonB-dependent ferri-siderophore receptors in the outer membrane. We here describe a new nuclease bacteriocin, pyocin S6, encoded in the genome of a P. aeruginosa cystic fibrosis (CF) clinical isolate, CF_PA39. Similarly to pyocins S1 and S2, the S6 toxin-immunity gene tandem was recruited to the genomic region encoding exotoxin A. The pyocin S6 receptor-binding and translocation domains are identical to those of pyocin S1, whereas the killing domain is similar to the 16S ribonuclease domain of Escherichia coli colicin E3. The cytotoxic activity was abolished in pyocin S6 forms with a mutation in the colicin E3-equivalent catalytic motif. The CF_PA39 S6 immunity gene displays a higher expression level than the gene encoding the killing protein, the latter being only detected when bacteria are grown under iron-limiting conditions. In the S1-pyocinogenic strain P. aeruginosa ATCC 25324 and pyocin S2 producer P. aeruginosa PAO1, a remnant of the pyocin S6 killing domain and an intact S6-type immunity gene are located downstream of their respective pyocin operons. Strain PAO1 is insensitive for pyocin S6, and its S6-type immunity gene provides protection against pyocin S6 activity. Purified pyocin S6 inhibits one-fifth of 110 P. aeruginosa CF clinical isolates tested, showing clearer inhibition zones when the target cells are grown under iron limitation. In this panel, about half of the CF clinical isolates were found to host the S6 genes. The pyocin S6 locus is also present in the genome of some non-CF clinical isolates.","851":"Toxin\/antitoxin (TA) systems are the means by which bacterial cells become persistent; that is, those cells that are tolerant to multiple environmental stresses such as antibiotics by becoming metabolically dormant. These persister cells are responsible for recalcitrant infections. Once toxins are activated by the inactivation of antitoxins (e.g., stress-triggered Lon degradation of the antitoxin), many toxins reduce metabolism by inhibiting translation (e.g., cleaving mRNA, reducing ATP). The MqsR\/MqsA TA system of Escherichia coli cleaves mRNA to help the cell withstand oxidative and bile acid stress. Here, we investigated the role of secondary structure and 5' mRNA processing on MqsR degradation of mRNA and found that MqsR cleaves only single-stranded RNA at 5'-GCU sites and that MqsR is equally active against RNA with 5'-triphosphate, 5'-monophosphate, and 5'-hydroxyl groups.","852":"Elucidating the spatial dynamic and core gut microbiome related to wild bar-headed goose is of crucial importance for probiotics development that may meet the demands of bar-headed goose artificial breeding industries and accelerate the domestication of this species. However, the core microbial communities in the wild bar-headed geese remain totally unknown. Here, for the first time, we present a comprehensive survey of bar-headed geese gut microbial communities by Illumina high-throughput sequencing technology using nine individuals from three distinct wintering locations in Tibet. A total of 236,676 sequences were analyzed, and 607 OTUs were identified. We show that the gut microbial communities of bar-headed geese have representatives of 14 phyla and are dominated by Firmicutes, Proteobacteria, Actinobacteria, and Bacteroidetes. The additive abundance of these four most dominant phyla was above 96% across all the samples. At the genus level, the sequences represented 150 genera. A set of 19 genera were present in all samples and considered as core gut microbiome. The top seven most abundant core genera were distributed in that four dominant phyla. Among them, four genera (Lactococcus, Bacillus, Solibacillus, and Streptococcus) belonged to Firmicutes, while for other three phyla, each containing one genus, such as Proteobacteria (genus Pseudomonas), Actinobacteria (genus Arthrobacter), and Bacteroidetes (genus Bacteroides). This broad survey represents the most in-depth assessment, to date, of the gut microbes that associated with bar-headed geese. These data create a baseline for future bar-headed goose microbiology research, and make an original contribution to probiotics development for bar-headed goose artificial breeding industries.

The main principle of Min system function involves the formation of an inhibitor gradient along the cell axis; however, the establishment of this gradient differs between two well-studied gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. While in gram-negative Escherichia coli, the Min system undergoes pole-to-pole oscillation, in gram-positive Bacillus subtilis, proper spatial inhibition is achieved by the preferential attraction of the Min proteins to the cell poles. Nevertheless, when E.coli Min proteins are inserted into B.subtilis cells, they still oscillate, which negatively affects asymmetric septation during sporulation in this organism. Interestingly, homologs of both Min systems were found to be present in various combinations in the genomes of anaerobic and endospore-forming Clostridia, including the pathogenic Clostridium difficile. Here, we have investigated the localization and behavior of C.difficile Min protein homologs and showed that MinDE proteins of C.difficile can oscillate when expressed together in B.subtilis cells. We have also investigated the effects of this oscillation on B.subtilis sporulation, and observed decreased sporulation efficiency in strains harboring the MinDE genes. Additionally, we have evaluated the effects of C.difficile Min protein expression on vegetative division in this heterologous host.","856":"Changjiang (Yangtze River) Estuary has experienced severe hypoxia since the 1950s. In order to investigate potential ecological functions of key microorganisms in relation to hypoxia, we performed 16S rRNA-based Illumina Miseq sequencing to explore the bacterial diversity in the surface sediments of the hypoxic zone near the Changjiang Estuary and in the East China Sea (ECS). The results showed that numerous Proteobacteria-affiliated sequences in the sediments of the inner continental shelf were related to both sulfate-reducing and sulfur-oxidizing bacteria, suggesting an active sulfur cycle in this area. Many sequences retrieved from the hypoxic zone were also related to Planctomycetes from two marine upwelling systems, which may be involved in the initial breakdown of sulfated heteropolysaccharides. Bacteroidetes, which is expected to degrade high-molecular-weight organic matter, was abundant in all the studied stations except for station A8, which was the deepest and possessed the largest grain size. In addition, dissolved organic carbon, water depth, percentage ratio of clay to silt, salinity, and sedimentary grain size were environmental effectors that shaped the sedimentary microbial community structure. Our results showed that putative Gammaproteobacteria-affiliated sulfur-oxidizing bacteria may not only detoxify hydrogen sulfide produced by sulfate-reducing prokaryotes, but also serve as the primary producers in the marine sediments. Specific groups of aerobic Bacteroidetes and Planctomycetes participated in degrading organic matter, which might contribute to the oxygen depletion in the hypoxic zones. ","857":"Burkholderia contaminans MS14 shows significant antimicrobial activities against plant and animal pathogenic fungi and bacteria. The antifungal agent occidiofungin produced by MS14 has great potential for development of biopesticides and pharmaceutical drugs. However, the use of Burkholderia species as biocontrol agent in agriculture is restricted due to the difficulties in distinguishing between plant growth-promoting bacteria and the pathogenic bacteria. The complete MS14 genome was sequenced and analyzed to find what beneficial and virulence-related genes it harbors. The phylogenetic relatedness of B. contaminans MS14 and other 17 Burkholderia species was also analyzed. To research MS14's potential virulence, the gene regions related to the antibiotic production, antibiotic resistance, and virulence were compared between MS14 and other Burkholderia genomes. The genome of B. contaminans MS14 was sequenced and annotated. The genomic analyses reveal the presence of multiple gene sets for antimicrobial biosynthesis, which contribute to its antimicrobial activities. BLAST results indicate that the MS14 genome harbors a large number of unique regions. MS14 is closely related to another plant growth-promoting Burkholderia strain B. lata 383 according to the average nucleotide identity data. Moreover, according to the phylogenetic analysis, plant growth-promoting species isolated from soils and mammalian pathogenic species are clustered together, respectively. MS14 has multiple antimicrobial activity-related genes identified from the genome, but it lacks key virulence-related gene loci found in the pathogenic strains. Additionally, plant growth-promoting Burkholderia species have one or more antimicrobial biosynthesis genes in their genomes as compared with nonplant growth-promoting soil-isolated Burkholderia species. On the other hand, pathogenic species harbor multiple virulence-associated gene loci that are not present in nonpathogenic Burkholderia species. The MS14 genome as well as Burkholderia species genome show considerable diversity. Multiple antimicrobial agent biosynthesis genes were identified in the genome of plant growth-promoting species of Burkholderia. In addition, by comparing to nonpathogenic Burkholderia species, pathogenic Burkholderia species have more characterized homologs of the gene loci known to contribute to pathogenicity and virulence to plant and animals.","858":"","859":"Bacteroides spp. have been proposed as indicators of fecal contamination in microbial source tracking (MST) methodologies. The aim of this study was to develop new qPCR assays that target host-specific Bacteroidal 16S ribosomal RNA genes, to determine the source of fecal contamination in water. Denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis (DGGE) was used to select for host-specific bands of Bacteroides associated with a fecal pollution source and later to design four qPCR host-specific assays. A set of common primers for Bacteroides spp., four different Bacteroides spp. host-associated hydrolysis probes (human, cattle, pig, and poultry), and one hydrolysis probe for the Bacteroides genus were designed. This set of qPCR assays together with other previously developed Bacteroidetes MST targets were used to analyze water samples with fecal contamination from the four sources studied. The host-specific Bacteroides qPCRs designed for human (HMprobeBac), pig (PGprobeBac), and poultry (PLprobeBac) were highly specific for its sources (1.0, 0.97, and 1.0, respectively) although its sensitivity was lower (0.45, 0.50, and 0.73, respectively). The cattle-specific qPCR was totally unspecific and was discarded for future experiments. When compared to previously designed assays, the human and pig qPCRs showed better accuracies (0.86 and 0.84) than their counterparts HF183 and Pig-2-Bac (0.38 and 0.65). Thus, the newly designed human, pig, and poultry qPCR assays outperform other methods developed until date and may be useful for source tracking purposes. ","860":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is a global problem impeding the effective prevention\/treatment of an ever-growing array of infections caused by pathogens; a huge challenge threatening the achievements of modern medicine. In this paper, we report the occurrence of multidrug resistance (MDR) in Escherichia coli strains isolated from discharged final effluents of two wastewater treatment facilities in the Eastern Cape Province of South Africa. Standard disk diffusion method was employed to determine the antibiotic susceptibility profile of 223 polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-confirmed E. coli isolates against 17 common antibiotics in human therapy and veterinary medicine. Seven virulence associated and fourteen antibiotic resistance genes were also evaluated by molecular methods. Molecular characterization revealed five pathotypes of E. coli in the following proportions: enterotoxigenic ETEC (1.4%), enteropathogenic EPEC (7.6%), enteroaggregative EAEC (7.6%), neonatal meningitis (NMEC) (14.8%), uropathogenic (41.7%), and others (26.9%). Isolates showed varying (1.7-70.6%) degrees of resistance to 15 of the test antibiotics. Multidrug resistance was exhibited by 32.7% of the isolates, with the commonest multiple antibiotic-resistant phenotype (MARP) being AP-T-CFX (12 isolates), while multiple antibiotic-resistant indices (MARI) estimated are 0.23 (Site 1) and 0.24 (Site 2). Associated antibiotic resistance genes detected in the isolates include: strA (88.2%), aadA (52.9%), cat I (15%), cmlA1 (4.6%), blaTEM (56.4%), tetA (30.4%), tetB (28.4%), tetC (42.2%), tetD (50%), tetK (11.8%), and tetM (68.6%). We conclude that municipal wastewater effluents are important reservoirs for the dissemination of potentially pathogenic E. coli (and possibly other pathogens) and antibiotic resistance genes in the aquatic milieu of the Eastern Cape and a risk to public health.","861":"Microvirga massiliensis sp. nov. strain JC119(T) is a bacteria isolated in Marseille from a stool sample collected in Senegal.

This bacterium is aerobic, gram negative, catalase positive, and oxidase negative. The draft genome of M. massiliensis JC119(T) comprises a 9,207,211-bp-long genome that is the largest bacterial genome of an isolate in humans. The genome exhibits a G+C content of 63.28% and contains 8685 protein-coding genes and 77 RNA genes, including 21 rRNA genes.

However, investigations into the \"programming\" effects of catch-up growth on gut microbiota in the offspring are limited. C57\/BL6 mice were fed on either low protein (LP) or normal chow (NC) diet throughout gestation and lactation. Then, the offspring were randomly weaned to either NC or high fat (HF) diet until 32 weeks of age, generating four experimental groups: NC-NC, NC-HF, LP-NC, and LP-HF. Metabolic parameters and gut microbiota were examined in the offspring. It showed that the NC-HF and LP-HF offspring displayed higher body weight (P &lt; 0.05), impaired glucose tolerance (P &lt; 0.001), and elevated serum lipids (P &lt; 0.05) at 32 weeks of age. Both the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) and the Shannon indexes (P &lt; 0.05) showed significantly lower microbial diversity in NC-HF and LP-HF offspring. There were significant variations in the compositions of gut microbiota in the NC-HF and LP-HF offspring, compared with NC-NC offspring (P &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, it indicated Lactobacillus percentage was negatively associated with blood glucose concentrations of intraperitoneal glucose tolerance test (r = -0.886, P = 0.019). In conclusion, catch-up growth predisposes the offspring to gut microbiota perturbation, obesity, impaired glucose tolerance, insulin resistance, and dyslipidemia. Our study is novel in showing the \"programming\" effects of nutrition-induced catch-up growth on gut microbiota and metabolic diseases in later life.","863":"Neisseria meningitidis is a leading cause of fatal sepsis and meningitis worldwide. As for commensal species of human neisseriae, N. meningitidis inhabits the human nasopharynx and asymptomatic colonization is ubiquitous. Only rarely does the organism invade and survive in the bloodstream leading to disease. Moonlighting proteins perform two or more autonomous, often dissimilar, functions using a single polypeptide chain. They have been increasingly reported on the surface of both prokaryotic and eukaryotic organisms and shown to interact with a variety of host ligands. In some organisms moonlighting proteins perform virulence-related functions, and they may play a role in the pathogenesis of N. meningitidis. Fructose-1,6-bisphosphate aldolase (FBA) was previously shown to be surface-exposed in meningococci and involved in adhesion to host cells. In this study, FBA was shown to be present on the surface of both pathogenic and commensal neisseriae, and surface localization and anchoring was demonstrated to be independent of aldolase activity. Importantly, meningococcal FBA was found to bind to human glu-plasminogen in a dose-dependent manner. Site-directed mutagenesis demonstrated that the C-terminal lysine residue of FBA was required for this interaction, whereas subterminal lysine residues were not involved. ","864":"Methylococcus capsulatus (Bath) is a methanotroph that possesses both a membrane-embedded (pMMO) and a soluble methane monooxygenase (sMMO). The expression of these two MMO's is tightly controlled by the availability of copper in the growth medium, but the underlying mechanisms and the number of genes involved in this switch in methane oxidation is not yet fully elucidated. Microarray analyses were used to assess the transcriptome in cells producing either pMMO or sMMO. A total of 137 genes were differentially expressed, with 87 genes showing a significant up-regulation during sMMO production. The majority of the differentially expressed genes could be assigned to functional roles in the energy metabolism and transport. Furthermore, three copper responding gene clusters were discovered, including an extended cluster that also harbors the genes for sMMO. Our data also indicates that major changes takes place in the respiratory chain between pMMO- and sMMO-producing cells, and that quinone are predominantly used as the electron donors for methane oxidation by pMMO. Intriguingly, a large proportion of the differentially expressed genes between pMMO- and sMMO-producing cells encode c-type cytochromes. By combining microarray- and mass spectrometry data, a total of 35 c-type cytochromes are apparently expressed in M. capsulatus when grown in nitrate mineral salt medium with methane as sole energy and carbon source, and the expression of 21 of these respond to the availability of copper. Interestingly, several of these c-type cytochromes are recovered from the cell surface, suggesting that extracellular electron transfers may occur in M. capsulatus.

For the sake of application, using public genomes of five bacterial strains involved in copper bioleaching: Acidiphilium cryptum, Acidithiobacillus ferrooxidans, Acidithiobacillus thiooxidans, Leptospirillum ferriphilum, and Sulfobacillus thermosulfidooxidans, we first reconstructed a global metabolic network. Next, using a parsimony assumption, we deciphered sets of genes, called Sets from Genome Segments (SGS), that (1) are close on their respective genomes, (2) take an active part in metabolic pathways and (3) whose associated metabolic reactions are also closely connected within metabolic networks. Overall, this SGS paradigm depicts genomic functional units that emphasize respective roles of bacterial strains to catalyze metabolic pathways and environmental processes. Our analysis suggested that only few functional metabolic genes are horizontally transferred within the consortium and that no single bacterial strain can accomplish by itself the whole copper bioleaching. The use of SGS pinpoints a functional compartmentalization among the investigated species and exhibits putative bacterial interactions necessary for promoting these pathways. ","867":"Myxobacteria harbor an enormous potential for new bioactive secondary metabolites and therefore the isolation of in particular new groups is of great interest. The diversity of myxobacteria present in two ecological habitats, namely sand from Kiritimati Island and German compost, was evaluated by both cultivation-based and cultivation-independent methods. Phylogenetic analyses of the strains in comparison with 16S rRNA gene sequences from cultured and uncultured material in GenBank revealed a great potential of undescribed myxobacteria in both sampling sites. Several OTUs (operational taxonomic units) represent unknown taxa and were detected by clone bank analyses, but not by cultivation. Clone bank analyses indicated that the myxobacterial community is predominantly indigenous. The 16S rDNA libraries from the two samples were generated from total community DNA with myxobacterial specific forward and universal reverse primer sets. The clones were partially sequenced. Cultivation was successful for exclusively bacteriolytic, but not for cellulolytic myxobacteria and revealed 42 strains from the genera Corallococcus, Myxococcus, and Polyangium. The genera of Myxococcaceae family were represented by both approaches. But, even in this well studied family, as well as in the suborders Sorangiineae and Nannocystineae, a considerable number of clones were assigned to, if any, uncultivated organisms. Our study shows an overrepresentation of the genera Myxococcus spp. and Corallococcus spp. with standard cultivation methods. However, high deficits are demonstrated in the cultivation success of the myxobacterial diversity detected by exclusively cultivation-independent approaches. Especially, clades which are exclusively represented by clones are of high interest with regard to the cultivation of new bioactive secondary metabolite producers.

The specificity-conferring code was adapted for use in Pseudomonas and mutated adenylation domain active site sequences were introduced in the kalimantacin gene cluster, using a newly adapted ligation independent cloning method. Antimicrobial activity screens and LC-MS analyses revealed that the production of the kalimantacin analogues in the mutated strains was abolished. These results support the idea that further insight in the specificity of downstream domains in nonribosomal peptide synthetases and polyketide synthases is required to efficiently engineer these strains in vivo. ","869":"The aim of the study was to develop a sensitive method using quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) with pooled fecal samples for the screening of Johne's disease (JD). Manufacturer-specified and our new pooling method in combination with five commercial kits for DNA extraction and purification were compared. Different volumes of pooled fecal suspensions were tested, and the results were compared for individual samples and three pool sizes (5, 10, and 50 samples); each of the fecal suspensions, which were prepared from healthy dairy and beef cattle was spiked with 0, 10, 100, or 1000 cultured Mycobacterium avium subspecies paratuberculosis (MAP) organisms or was mixed with fecal suspensions from experimentally infected cattle. The MAP DNA detection proportion with our pooling method in combination with Johne-Spin kit (Fasmac, Japan) was 100% for all models and all pool sizes, except for the low shedder model with a pool size of 50. There was no loss of sensitivity in pools of 10 subjects or less by using the new method. These results suggest that new method is a sensitive, practical, and cost-effective screening test for the detection of MAP-infected cattle and the monitoring of JD-free herds.

We investigated novel sodium ion rhodopsin (NaR) and halorhodopsin (HR) genes from PR-containing flavobacteria that were previously isolated from diverse aquatic sites, mainly from tidal flat sediment (62.5%). In 16 PR-containing isolates, three new types of genes were found. Among these three isolates, one (Nonlabens sp. YIK11 isolated from sediment) contained both the NaR and chloride ion rhodopsin (ClR) - HR type of gene. The sequences showed that the DTE (proton pump), NDQ (sodium ion pump) and NTQ (chloride ion pump) motifs corresponding to the D85, T89, and D96 positions in bacteriorhodopsin (BR) were well conserved. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that three NaR and one ClR grouped within the same clade, as previously reported. Illumination of cell suspensions showed the change in proton pump activity, supporting that one or more rhodopsins are functional. The qRT-PCR study revealed that three rhodopsin genes, especially NaR, are highly induced when they are incubated in the presence of light or in the absence of sufficient nutrients. The expression levels of the DTE, NDQ, and NTQ motif-containing rhodopsin genes in YIK11 correlate positively with illumination, but negatively with nutrient levels. Based on those results, we concluded that light has a positive impact on the relative expression levels of the three rhodopsin genes in the flavobacterium, Nonlabens sp. YIK11, but with no apparent positive impact on growth. Consequently, light did not stimulate the growth of YIK11 as determined by cell numbers in a nutrient-limited or -enriched medium, although it contains and induces three rhodopsins. ","872":"The bacterium Corynebacterium glutamicum is utilized during industrial fermentation to produce amino acids such as L-glutamate. During L-glutamate fermentation, C. glutamicum changes the flux of central carbon metabolism to favor L-glutamate production, but the molecular mechanisms that explain these flux changes remain largely unknown. Here, we found that the profiles of two major lysine acyl modifications were significantly altered upon glutamate overproduction in C. glutamicum; acetylation decreased, whereas succinylation increased. A label-free semi-quantitative proteomic analysis identified 604 acetylated proteins with 1328 unique acetylation sites and 288 succinylated proteins with 651 unique succinylation sites. Acetylation and succinylation targeted enzymes in central carbon metabolic pathways that are directly related to glutamate production, including the 2-oxoglutarate dehydrogenase complex (ODHC), a key enzyme regulating glutamate overproduction. Structural mapping revealed that several critical lysine residues in the ODHC components were susceptible to acetylation and succinylation. Furthermore, induction of glutamate production was associated with changes in the extent of acetylation and succinylation of lysine, suggesting that these modifications may affect the activity of enzymes involved in glutamate production. Deletion of phosphotransacetylase decreased the extent of protein acetylation in nonproducing condition, suggesting that acetyl phosphate-dependent acetylation is active in C. glutamicum. However, no effect was observed on the profiles of acetylation and succinylation in glutamate-producing condition upon disruption of acetyl phosphate metabolism or deacetylase homologs. It was considered likely that the reduced acetylation in glutamate-producing condition may reflect metabolic states where the flux through acid-producing pathways is very low, and substrates for acetylation do not accumulate in the cell. Succinylation would occur more easily than acetylation in such conditions where the substrates for both acetylation and succinylation are limited. This is the first study investigating the acetylome and succinylome of C. glutamicum, and it provides new insight into the roles of acyl modifications in C. glutamicum biology.","873":"The Legionella pneumophila effector protein VipA is an actin nucleator that co-localizes with actin filaments and early endosomes in infected macrophages and which interferes with organelle trafficking when expressed in yeast. To identify the regions of VipA involved in its subcellular localization and functions, we ectopically expressed specific VipA mutant proteins in eukaryotic cells. This indicated that the characteristic punctate distribution of VipA depends on its NH2 -terminal (amino acid residues 1-133) and central coiled-coil (amino acid residues 133-206) regions, and suggested a role for the COOH-terminal (amino acid residues 206-339) region in association with actin filaments and for the NH2 -terminal in co-localization with early endosomes. Co-immunoprecipitation and in vitro assays showed that the COOH-terminal region of VipA is necessary and sufficient to mediate actin binding, and is essential but insufficient to induce microfilament formation. Assays in yeast revealed that the NH2 and the COOH-terminal regions, and possibly an NPY motif within the NH2 region of VipA, are necessary for interference with organelle trafficking. Overall, this suggests that subversion of eukaryotic vesicular trafficking by VipA involves both its ability to associate with early endosomes via its NH2 -terminal region and its capacity to bind and polymerize actin through its COOH-terminal region. ","874":"We recently reported a flavin-trafficking protein (Ftp) in the syphilis spirochete Treponema pallidum (Ftp_Tp) as the first bacterial metal-dependent FAD pyrophosphatase that hydrolyzes FAD into AMP and FMN in the periplasm. Orthologs of Ftp_Tp in other bacteria (formerly ApbE) appear to lack this hydrolytic activity; rather, they flavinylate the redox subunit, NqrC, via their metal-dependent FMN transferase activity. However, nothing has been known about the nature or mechanism of metal-dependent Ftp catalysis in either Nqr- or Rnf-redox-containing bacteria. In the current study, we identified a bimetal center in the crystal structure of Escherichia coli Ftp (Ftp_Ec) and show via mutagenesis that a single amino acid substitution converts it from an FAD-binding protein to a Mg(2+)-dependent FAD pyrophosphatase (Ftp_Tp-like). Furthermore, in the presence of protein substrates, both types of Ftps are capable of flavinylating periplasmic redox-carrying proteins (e.g., RnfG_Ec) via the metal-dependent covalent attachment of FMN. A high-resolution structure of the Ftp-mediated flavinylated protein of Shewanella oneidensis NqrC identified an essential lysine in phosphoester-threonyl-FMN bond formation in the posttranslationally modified flavoproteins. Together, these discoveries broaden our understanding of the physiological capabilities of the bacterial periplasm, and they also clarify a possible mechanism by which flavoproteins are generated.","875":"Accreditation to ISO\/IEC 17025 is required for EC official food control and veterinary laboratories by Regulation (EC) No. 882\/2004. Measurements in hospital laboratories and clinics are increasingly accredited to ISO\/IEC 15189. Both of these management standards arose from command and control military standards for factory inspection during World War II. They rely on auditing of compliance and have not been validated internally as assessment bodies require of those they accredit. Neither have they been validated to criteria outside their own ideology such as the Cochrane principles of evidence-based medicine which might establish whether any benefit exceeds their cost. We undertook a retrospective meta-audit over 14 years of internal and external laboratory audits that checked compliance with ISO 17025 in a public health laboratory. Most noncompliances arose solely from clauses in the standard and would not affect users. No effect was likely from 91% of these. Fewer than 1% of noncompliances were likely to have consequences for the validity of results or quality of service. The ISO system of compliance auditing has the performance characteristics of a poor screening test. It adds substantially to costs and generates more noise (false positives) than informative signal. Ethical use of resources indicates that management standards should not be used unless proven to deliver the efficacy, effectiveness, and value required of modern healthcare interventions.","876":"Carbonic anhydrase (CA) plays an important role in the formation and evolution of life. However, to our knowledge, there has been no report on CA isoenzyme function differentiation in fungi. Two different CA gene sequences in Aspergillus nidulans with clear genetic background provide us a favorable basis for studying function differentiation of CA isoenzymes. Heterologously expressed CA1 was used to test its weathering ability on silicate minerals and real-time quantitative PCR was used to detect expression of the CA1 and CA2 genes at different CO2 concentrations and in the presence of different potassium sources. The northern blot method was applied to confirm the result of CA1 gene expression. Heterologously expressed CA1 significantly promoted dissolution of biotite and wollastonite, and CA1 gene expression increased significantly in response to soluble K-deficiency. The northern blot test further showed that CA1 participated in K-feldspar weathering. In addition, the results showed that CA2 was primary involved in adapting to CO2 concentration change. Taken together, A. nidulans can choose different CA to meet their survival needs, which imply that some environmental microbes have evolved different CAs to adapt to changes in CO2 concentration and acquire mineral nutrition so that they can better adapt to environmental changes. Inversely, their adaption may impact mineral weathering and\/or CO2 concentration, and even global change. ","877":null,"878":"The Streptomyces avermitilis genome encodes a putative high-affinity [NiFe]-hydrogenase conferring the ability to oxidize tropospheric H2 in mature spores. Here, we used a combination of transcriptomic and mutagenesis approaches to shed light on the potential ecophysiological role of the enzyme. First, S. avermitilis was either exposed to low or hydrogenase-saturating levels of H2 to investigate the impact of H2 on spore transcriptome. In total, 1293 genes were differentially expressed, with 1127 and 166 showing lower and higher expression under elevated H2 concentration, respectively. High H2 exposure lowered the expression of the Sec protein secretion pathway and ATP-binding cassette-transporters, with increased expression of genes encoding proteins directing carbon metabolism toward sugar anabolism and lower expression of NADH dehydrogenase in the respiratory chain. Overall, the expression of relA responsible for the synthesis of the pleiotropic alarmone ppGpp decreased upon elevated H2 exposure, which likely explained the reduced expression of antibiotic synthesis and stress response genes. Finally, deletion of hhySL genes resulted in a loss of H2 uptake activity and a dramatic loss of viability in spores. We propose that H2 is restricted to support the seed bank of Streptomyces under a unique survival-mixotrophic energy mode and discuss important ecological implications of this finding. ","879":"Bacterial pathogens can exploit metabolic pathways to facilitate their successful infection cycles, but little is known about roles of d-galactosamine (GalN)\/N-acetyl-d-galactosamine (GalNAc) catabolism pathway in bacterial pathogenesis. Here, we report the genomic reconstruction of GalN\/GalNAc utilization pathway in Streptococci and the diversified aga regulons. We delineated two new paralogous AgaR regulators for the GalN\/GalNAc catabolism pathway. The electrophoretic mobility shift assays experiment demonstrated that AgaR2 (AgaR1) binds the predicted palindromes, and the combined in vivo data from reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction and RNA-seq suggested that AgaR2 (not AgaR1) can effectively repress the transcription of the target genes. Removal of agaR2 (not agaR1) from Streptococcus suis 05ZYH33 augments significantly the abilities of both adherence to Hep-2 cells and anti-phagocytosis against RAW264.7 macrophage. As anticipated, the dysfunction in AgaR2-mediated regulation of S. suis impairs its pathogenicity in experimental models of both mice and piglets. Our finding discovered two novel regulators specific for GalN\/GalNAc catabolism and assigned them distinct roles into bacterial infections. To the best of our knowledge, it might represent a first paradigm that links the GalN\/GalNAc catabolism pathway to bacterial pathogenesis. ","880":"We investigated the prevalence of Staphylococcus aureus on shopping baskets in Osaka Prefecture, Japan. Multilocus sequence typing was performed to determine the genotypes of S. aureus isolates, and then a polymerase chain reaction method was used to detect staphylococcal enterotoxins and antibiotic resistance genes. In addition, desiccation tolerance of S. aureus isolates was evaluated in vitro. Forty-six (6.2%) S. aureus isolates were collected from 740 shopping baskets, though only one MRSA strain was identified. In multilocus sequence typing findings, ten sequence types and 24 singletons were classified, which were divided into ten clonal complexes and six singletons. The most frequent staphylococcal enterotoxin gene was seg (30.4%). Our in vitro findings demonstrated that 70% of the S. aureus isolates, including the MRSA strain, became undetectable at 12 h after desiccation at an appropriate cell density, while the others remained viable for up to 24 h. Thus, it is difficult for MRSA organisms to survive on dry surfaces found in public areas. We speculated that inanimate objects in the community are unlikely to be a potential source for transmission of MRSA and that S. aureus on such objects outside of hospital settings is not a public health threat.","881":null,"882":"The rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae grows inside living host cells. Cytological analyses by live-cell imaging have revealed characteristics of the biotrophic invasion, particularly the extrainvasive hyphal membrane (EIHM) originating from the host plasma membrane and a host membrane-rich structure, biotrophic interfacial complex (BIC). Here, we observed rice subcellular changes associated with invasive hyphal growth using various transformants expressing specifically localized fluorescent proteins. The invasive hyphae did not penetrate across but were surrounded by the host vacuolar membrane together with EIHM even after branching. High-resolution imaging of BICs revealed that the host cytosol was accumulated at BIC with aggregated EIHM and a symplastic effector, Pwl2, in a punctate form. The vacuolar membrane did not aggregate in but closely surrounded the BIC. A good correlation was observed between the early collapse of vacuoles and damage of invasive hyphae in the first-invaded cell. Furthermore, a newly developed, long-term imaging method has revealed that the central vacuole gradually shrank until collapse, which was caused by the hyphal invasion occurring earlier in the neighboring cells than in the first-invaded cells. These data suggest that M. oryzae may suppress host vacuole collapse during early infection stages for successful infection. ","883":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a versatile opportunistic pathogen that causes chronic infections in immunocompromised hosts. Multiple porins modulate outer membrane permeability under various environmental conditions. The lung environment of cystic fibrosis (CF) patients is unique with changes occurring in nutrient availability, osmolarity, and oxygen content. Although P. aeruginosa gene expression is modified under these conditions, little is known about how they influence porin regulation. In this study, we evaluated the regulation of the outer membrane porin OpdQ, a member of the OprD family of porins, with regard to oxygen, nitrate, and\/or NaCl levels. We demonstrated using promoter::fusion clones of P. aeruginosa PAO1 and clinical strains collected from CF patients that OpdQ was transcriptionally repressed under low oxygen but increased in the presence of nitrate. The nitrate-induced regulation of OpdQ was found to be dependent on the transcription factor NarL via the NarXL two-component system. In addition, NaCl-induced osmotic stress increased OpdQ production among most of the clinical strains evaluated. In conclusion, these data identify for the first time that specific environmental cues associated with the CF microenvironment influence porin regulation, and that the nitrate-induced regulation of OpdQ is associated with nitrate metabolism via the NarXL two-component system of P. aeruginosa. ","884":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a clinically relevant species involved in biofilm-based chronic infections. We provide evidence that the P. aeruginosa LapG protein functions as a periplasmic protease that can cleave the protein adhesin CdrA off the cell surface, and thereby plays a role in biofilm formation and biofilm dispersal. The P. aeruginosa LapG protein is shown to be a functional homolog of the Pseudomonas putida LapG protein which has previously been shown to function as a periplasmic protease that targets the surface adhesin LapA. Transposon mutagenesis and characterization of defined knockout mutants provided evidence that the CdrA adhesin is a target of LapG in P. aeruginosa. A wspF lapG double mutant was hyper-aggregating and hyper biofilm forming, whereas a wspF lapG cdrA triple mutant lost these phenotypes. In addition, western blot detection of CdrA in culture supernatants and whole-cell protein fractions showed that CdrA was retained in the whole-cell protein fraction when LapG was absent, whereas it was found in the culture supernatant when LapG was present. The finding that CdrA is a target of LapG in P. aeruginosa is surprising because CdrA has no homology to LapA. ","885":"We have identified a new downstream target gene of the Aft1\/2-regulated iron regulon in budding yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, the late-annotated small open reading frame LSO1. LSO1 transcript is among the most highly induced from a transcriptome analysis of a fet3-1 mutant grown in the presence of the iron chelator bathophenanthrolinedisulfonic acid. LSO1 has a paralog, LSO2, which is constitutively expressed and not affected by iron availability. In contrast, we find that the LSO1 promoter region contains three consensus binding sites for the Aft1\/2 transcription factors and that an LSO1-lacZ reporter is highly induced under low-iron conditions in a Aft1-dependent manner. The expression patterns of the Lso1 and Lso2 proteins mirror those of their mRNAs. Both proteins are localized to the nucleus and cytoplasm, but become more cytoplasmic upon iron deprivation consistent with a role in iron transport. LSO1 and LSO2 appear to play overlapping roles in the cellular response to iron starvation since single lso1 and lso2 mutants are sensitive to iron deprivation and this sensitivity is exacerbated when both genes are deleted.

The open reading frame encoding the largest Elongator subunit Elp1p has two in-frame 5' AUG methionine codons separated by 48 nucleotides. Here, we show that the second AUG acts as the start codon of translation. Furthermore, Elp1p was previously shown to exist in two major forms of which one was generated by proteolysis of full-length Elp1p and this proteolytic cleavage was suggested to regulate Elongator complex activity. In this study, we found that the vacuolar protease Prb1p was responsible for the cleavage of Elp1p. The cleavage occurs between residues 203 (Lys) and 204 (Ala) as shown by amine reactive Tandem Mass Tag followed by LC-MS\/MS (liquid chromatography mass spectrometry) analysis. However, using a modified protein extraction procedure, including trichloroacetic acid, only full-length Elp1p was observed, showing that truncation of Elp1p is an artifact occurring during protein extraction. Consequently, our results indicate that N-terminal truncation of Elp1p is not likely to regulate Elongator complex activity. ","889":null,"890":"Decreased biomass growth in iron (Fe)-limited Pseudomonas is generally attributed to downregulated expression of Fe-requiring proteins accompanied by an increase in siderophore biosynthesis. Here, we applied a stable isotope-assisted metabolomics approach to explore the underlying carbon metabolism in glucose-grown Pseudomonas putida KT2440. Compared to Fe-replete cells, Fe-limited cells exhibited a sixfold reduction in growth rate but the glucose uptake rate was only halved, implying an imbalance between glucose uptake and biomass growth. This imbalance could not be explained by carbon loss via siderophore production, which accounted for only 10% of the carbon-equivalent glucose uptake. In lieu of the classic glycolytic pathway, the Entner-Doudoroff (ED) pathway in Pseudomonas is the principal route for glucose catabolism following glucose oxidation to gluconate. Remarkably, gluconate secretion represented 44% of the glucose uptake in Fe-limited cells but only 2% in Fe-replete cells. Metabolic (13) C flux analysis and intracellular metabolite levels under Fe limitation indicated a decrease in carbon fluxes through the ED pathway and through Fe-containing metabolic enzymes. The secreted siderophore was found to promote dissolution of Fe-bearing minerals to a greater extent than the high extracellular gluconate. In sum, bypasses in the Fe-limited glucose metabolism were achieved to promote Fe availability via siderophore secretion and to reroute excess carbon influx via enhanced gluconate secretion.

From growing cells that were exposed or unexposed to acrolein, a commonly used biocide in hydraulic fracturing processes, DNA was extracted, digested to 2'-deoxynucleosides and analyzed by liquid chromatography-positive ionization electrospray-tandem mass spectrometry in selected reaction monitoring mode transmitting the [M + H](+) &gt; [M + H - 116](+) transition over 100 transitions. Overall data shown as DNA adductome maps revealed numerous putative DNA adducts under both conditions with some occurring specifically for each condition. Adductomic analyses of triplicate samples indicated that elevated levels of some targeted putative adducts occurred in exposed cells. Two exposure-specific adducts were identified in exposed cells as 3-(2'-deoxyribosyl)-5,6,7,8-tetrahydro-6-hydroxy-(and 8-hydroxy-)pyrimido[1,2-a]- purine-(3H)-one (6- and 8-hydroxy-PdG) following synthesis of authentic standards of these compounds and subsequent analyses. A time course experiment showed that 6- and 8-hydroxy-PdG were detected in bacterial DNA within 30 min of acrolein exposure but were not detected in unexposed cells. This work demonstrated the first application of DNA adductomics to examine DNA damage in a bacterium and sets a foundation for future work.","893":"To evaluate microbial eukaryotic diversity and distribution in mesoscale processes, we investigated 18S rDNA diversity in a river plume and cyclonic eddy-influenced ecosystem in the southwestern South China Sea (SCS). Restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis was carried out using multiple primer sets. Relative to a wide range of previous similar studies, we observed a significantly higher proportion of sequences of pigmented taxa. Among the photosynthetic groups, Haptophyta accounted for 27.7% of the sequenced clones, which belonged primarily to Prymnesiophyceae. Unexpectedly, five operational taxonomic units of Cryptophyta were closely related to freshwater species. The Chlorophyta mostly fell within the Prasinophyceae, which was comprised of six clades, including Clade III, which is detected in the SCS for the first time in this study. Among the photosynthetic stramenopiles, Chrysophyceae was the most diverse taxon, which included seven clades. The majority of 18S rDNA sequences affiliated with the Dictyochophyceae, Eustigmatophyceae, and Pelagophyceae were closely related to those of pure cultures. The results of redundancy analysis and the permutation Mantel test based on unweighted UniFrac distances, conducted for spatial analyses of the Haptophyta subclades suggested that the Mekong River plume and cyclonic eddy play important roles in regulating microbial eukaryotic diversity and distribution in the southwestern SCS.

The lacustrine ecosystem of Lake Sayram has been intensely investigated. However, profiles of the microbial communities in the lake remain largely unknown. In this study, taxonomic compositions of the planktonic and sedimentary bacterial communities in Lake Sayram were investigated using 16S rRNA metagenomics. The lacustrine bacterial communities were generally structured by environmental conditions, including the hydrological and physicochemical parameters. Proteobacteria was the dominating phylum. In the lake water, the genera Acinetobacter and Ilumatobacter held an absolute predominance, implying their metabolic significance. In the bottom sediment, biogeochemically significant bacteria and thermophilic or acidothermophilic extremophiles were recovered. In contrast to the planktonic bacteria, an appreciable portion of the sedimentary bacteria could not be classified into any known taxonomic unit, indicating the largely unknown bacteriosphere hiding in the bottom sediment of Lake Sayram.","895":"IscR proteins are known as transcriptional regulators for Fe-S biogenesis. In the facultatively phototrophic bacterium, Rhodobacter sphaeroides IscR is the product of the first gene in the isc-suf operon. A major role of IscR in R. sphaeroides iron-dependent regulation was suggested in a bioinformatic study (Rodionov et al., PLoS Comput Biol 2:e163, 2006), which predicted a binding site in the upstream regions of several iron uptake genes, named Iron-Rhodo-box. Most known IscR proteins have Fe-S clusters featuring (Cys)3 (His)1 ligation. However, IscR proteins from Rhodobacteraceae harbor only a single-Cys residue and it was considered unlikely that they can ligate an Fe-S cluster. In this study, the role of R. sphaeroides IscR as transcriptional regulator and sensor of the Fe-S cluster status of the cell was analyzed. A mutant lacking IscR is more impaired in growth under iron limitation than the wild-type and exhibits significantly increased ROS levels in iron-replete and iron-deplete conditions. Expression studies reveal that R. sphaeroides IscR in its cluster-bound form functions as transcriptional repressor of genes involved in iron metabolism by direct binding to the promoter region of genes preceded by the motif. A total of 110 genes are directly or indirectly affected by IscR. Furthermore, IscR possesses a unique Fe-S cluster ligation scheme with only a single cysteine involved.","896":"This study aimed to find candidate strains of Lactobacillus isolated from sheep dairy products (yogurt and ewe colostrum) with probiotic and anticancer activity. A total of 100 samples were randomly collected from yogurt and colostrum and 125 lactic acid bacteria were isolated. Of these, 17 Lactobacillus strains belonging to five species (L. delbrueckii, L. plantarum, L. rhamnosus, L. paracasei, and L. casei) were identified. L. plantarum 17C and 13C, which isolated from colostrums, demonstrated remarkable results such as resistant to low pH and high concentrations of bile salts, susceptible to some antibiotics and good antimicrobial activity that candidate them as potential probiotics. Seven strains (1C, 5C, 12C, 13C, 17C, 7M, and 40M), the most resistant to simulated digestion, were further investigated to evaluate their capability to adhere to human intestinal Caco-2 cells. L. plantarum 17C was the most adherent strain. The bioactivity assessment of L. plantarum 17C showed anticancer effects via the induction of apoptosis on HT-29 human cancer cells and negligible side effects on one human epithelial normal cell line (FHs 74). The metabolites produced by this strain can be used as alternative pharmaceutical compounds with promising therapeutic indices because they are not cytotoxic to normal mammalian cells.

Suspension tests were used to obtain inactivation kinetics for the disinfectants against three spore types. The effects of heat-shocking spores after disinfectant treatment were also determined. Generalized linear mixed models were used to estimate 6-log reduction times for each spore type, disinfectant, and heat treatment combination. Reduction times were compared statistically using the delta method. Carrier tests were performed according to AOAC Official Method 966.04 and a modified version that employed immediate heat-shocking after disinfectant treatment. Carrier test results were analyzed using Fisher's exact test. PAA-based disinfectants had significantly shorter 6-log reduction times than the GA-based disinfectant. Heat-shocking B. anthracis spores after PAA treatment resulted in significantly shorter 6-log reduction times. Conversely, heat-shocking B. subtilis spores after PAA treatment resulted in significantly longer 6-log reduction times. Significant interactions were also observed between spore type, disinfectant, and heat treatment combinations. Immediately heat-shocking spore carriers after disinfectant treatment produced greater spore recovery. Sporicidal activities of disinfectants were not consistent across spore species. The effects of heat-shocking spores after disinfectant treatment were dependent on both disinfectant and spore species. Caution must be used when extrapolating sporicidal data of disinfectants from one spore species to another. Heat-shocking provides a more accurate picture of spore survival for only some disinfectant\/spore combinations. Collaborative studies should be conducted to further examine a revision of AOAC Official Method 966.04 relative to heat-shocking. ","898":"This study explores the role of membrane phospholipid peroxidation in the copper alloy mediated contact killing of Bacillus subtilis, a spore-forming gram-positive bacterial species. We found that B. subtilis endospores exhibited significant resistance to copper alloy surface killing but vegetative cells were highly sensitive to copper surface exposure. Cell death and lipid peroxidation occurred in B. subtilis upon copper alloy surface exposure. In a sporulation-defective strain carrying a deletion of almost the entire SpoIIA operon, lipid peroxidation directly correlated with cell death. Moreover, killing and lipid peroxidation initiated immediately and at a constant rate upon exposure to the copper surface without the delay observed previously in E. coli. These findings support the hypothesis that membrane lipid peroxidation is the initiating event causing copper surface induced cell death of B. subtilis vegetative cells. The findings suggest that the observed differences in the kinetics of copper-induced killing compared to E. coli result from differences in cell envelop structure. As demonstrated in E. coli, DNA degradation was shown to be a secondary effect of copper exposure in a B. subtilis sporulation-defective strain.","899":null,"900":"The M protein of Streptococcus pyogenes, a major bacterial virulence factor, has an amino-terminal hypervariable region (HVR) that is a target for type-specific protective antibodies. Intriguingly, the HVR elicits a weak antibody response, indicating that it escapes host immunity by two mechanisms, sequence variability and weak immunogenicity. However, the properties influencing the immunogenicity of regions in an M protein remain poorly understood. Here, we studied the antibody response to different regions of the classical M1 and M5 proteins, in which not only the HVR but also the adjacent fibrinogen-binding B repeat region exhibits extensive sequence divergence. Analysis of antisera from S. pyogenes-infected patients, infected mice, and immunized mice showed that both the HVR and the B repeat region elicited weak antibody responses, while the conserved carboxy-terminal part was immunodominant. Thus, we identified a correlation between sequence variability and weak immunogenicity for M protein regions. A potential explanation for the weak immunogenicity was provided by the demonstration that protease digestion selectively eliminated the HVR-B part from whole M protein-expressing bacteria. These data support a coherent model, in which the entire variable HVR-B part evades antibody attack, not only by sequence variability but also by weak immunogenicity resulting from protease attack.","901":null,"902":null,"903":null,"904":"Legionella pneumophila, a causative agent of Legionnaires' disease, is a facultative intracellular parasite of freshwater protozoa. Legionella pneumophila features a unique developmental network that involves several developmental forms including the infectious cyst forms. Reservoirs of L. pneumophila include natural and man-made freshwater systems; however, recent studies have shown that isolates of L. pneumophila can also be obtained directly from garden potting soil suggesting the presence of an additional reservoir. A previous study employing the metazoan Caenorhabditis elegans, a member of the Rhabditidae family of free-living soil nematodes, demonstrated that the intestinal lumen can be colonized with L. pneumophila. While both replicative forms and differentiated forms were observed in C. elegans, these morphologically distinct forms were initially observed to be restricted to the intestinal lumen. Using live DIC imaging coupled with focused transmission electron microscopy analyses, we report here that L. pneumophila is able to invade and establish Legionella-containing vacuoles (LCVs) in the intestinal cells. In addition, LCVs containing replicative and differentiated cyst forms were observed in the pseudocoelomic cavity and gonadal tissue of nematodes colonized with L. pneumophila. Furthermore, establishment of LCVs in the gonadal tissue was Dot\/Icm dependent and required the presence of the endocytic factor RME-1 to gain access to maturing oocytes. Our findings are novel as this is the first report, to our knowledge, of extraintestinal LCVs containing L. pneumophila cyst forms in C. elegans tissues, highlighting the potential of soil-dwelling nematodes as an alternate environmental reservoir for L. pneumophila.","905":"In microbes that fix nitrogen, nitrogenase catalyzes the conversion of N2 to ammonia in an ATP-demanding reaction. To help conserve energy some bacteria inhibit nitrogenase activity upon exposure to ammonium. The purple nonsulfur phototrophic bacterium Rhodopseudomonas palustris strain CGA009 can synthesize three functional nitrogenase isoenzymes: a molybdenum nitrogenase, a vanadium nitrogenase, and an iron nitrogenase. Previous studies showed that in some alphaproteobacteria, including R. palustris, molybdenum nitrogenase activity is inhibited by ADP-ribosylation when cells are exposed to ammonium. Some iron nitrogenases are also posttranslationally modified. However, the posttranslational modification of vanadium nitrogenase has not been reported. Here, we investigated the regulation of the alternative nitrogenases of R. palustris and determined that both its vanadium nitrogenase and its iron nitrogenase activities were inhibited and posttranslationally modified when cells are exposed to ammonium. Vanadium nitrogenase is not found in all strains of R. palustris, suggesting that it may have been acquired by horizontal gene transfer. Also, phylogenetic analyses of the three nitrogenases suggest that VnfH, the target of ADP-ribosylation, may be the product of a gene duplication of nifH, the molybdenum nitrogenase homolog.","906":null,"907":null,"908":"The primary habitat of the Escherichia coli species is the gut of warm-blooded vertebrates.

We distinguished three main clusters characterized by a particular abundance of two or more phylogroups within the E. coli animal commensal populations, which we called \"enterocolitypes\" by analogy with the enterotypes defined in the human gut microbiota at the genus level. These enterocolitypes were characterized by a dominant (&gt;50%) B2, B1, or A phylogroup and were associated with different host species, diets, and habitats: wild and herbivorous species (wild rabbits and deer), domesticated herbivorous species (domesticated rabbits, horses, sheep, and cows), and omnivorous species (boar, pigs, and chickens), respectively. By analyzing retrospectively the data obtained using the same approach from 98 healthy humans living in Ile de France (Smati et al. 2013, Appl. Environ. Microbiol. 79, 5005-5012), we identified a specific human enterocolitype characterized by the dominant and\/or exclusive (&gt;90%) presence of phylogroup B2. We then compared B2 strains isolated from animals and humans, and revealed that human and animal strains differ regarding O-type and B2 subgroup. Moreover, two genes, sfa\/foc and clbQ, were associated with the exclusive character of strains, observed only in humans. In conclusion, a complex network of interactions exists at several levels (genus and intra-species) within the intestinal microbiota.","909":"Glutathione (GSH) serves as the prime thiol in most organisms as its depletion increases antibiotic and metal toxicity, impairs oxidative stress responses, and affects Fe and Fe-S cluster metabolism. Many gram-positive bacteria lack GSH, but instead produce other structurally unrelated yet functionally equivalent thiols. Among those, bacillithiol (BSH) has been recently identified in several low G+C gram-positive bacteria. In this work, we have explored the link between BSH and Fe-S metabolism in Bacillus subtilis. We have identified that B. subtilis lacking BSH is more sensitive to oxidative stress (paraquat), and metal toxicity (Cu(I) and Cd(II)), but not H2 O2 . Furthermore, a slow growth phenotype of BSH null strain in minimal medium was observed, which could be recovered upon the addition of selected amino acids (Leu\/Ile and Glu\/Gln), supplementation of iron, or chemical complementation with BSH disulfide (BSSB) to the growth medium. Interestingly, Fe-S cluster containing isopropylmalate isomerase (LeuCD) and glutamate synthase (GOGAT) showed decreased activities in BSH null strain. Deficiency of BSH also resulted in decreased levels of intracellular Fe accompanied by increased levels of manganese and altered expression levels of Fe-S cluster biosynthetic SUF components. Together, this study is the first to establish a link between BSH and Fe-S metabolism in B. subtilis.","910":"In our previous work, we demonstrated that viable but nonculturable (VBNC) Vibrio cholerae O1 and O139 were converted to culturable by coculture with eukaryotic cells.

In this study, we purified FCVC by successive column chromatographies comprising UNO Q-6 anion exchange, Bio-Scale CHT2-1 hydroxyapatite, and Superdex 200 10\/300 GL. Homogeneity of the purified FCVC was demonstrated by SDS-PAGE. Nano-LC MS\/MS analysis showed that the purified FCVC was a human catalase. An experiment of RNAi knockdown of catalase mRNA from HT-29 cells and treatment of the purified FCVC with a catalase inhibitor, 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole confirmed that the FCVC was a catalase. A possible role of the catalase in converting a VBNC V. cholerae to a culturable state in the human intestine is discussed.","911":"Nowadays the identification of small RNAs (sRNAs) and characterization of their role within regulatory networks takes a prominent place in deciphering complex bacterial phenotypes. Compared to the study of other components of bacterial cells, this is a relatively new but fast-growing research field. Although reports on new sRNAs appear regularly, some sRNAs are already subject of research for a longer time. One of such sRNAs is MicA, a sRNA best described for its role in outer membrane remodeling, but probably having a much broader function than anticipated. An overview of what we have learnt from MicA led to the conclusion that even for this well-described sRNA, we still do not have the overall picture. More general, the story of MicA might become an experimental lead for unraveling the many sRNAs with unknown functions. In this review, three important topics in the sRNA field are covered, exemplified from the perspective of MicA: (i) identification of new sRNAs, (ii) target identification and unraveling the biological function, (iii) structural analysis. The complex mechanisms of action of MicA deliver some original insights in the sRNA field which includes the existence of dimer formation or simultaneous cis and trans regulation, and might further inspire the understanding of the function of other sRNAs. ","912":"Lactobacillus fermentum is commonly found in food products, and some strains are known to have beneficial effects on human health. However, our previous research indicated that L. fermentum AGR1487 decreases in vitro intestinal barrier integrity. The hypothesis was that cell surface structures of AGR1487 are responsible for the observed in vitro effect. AGR1487 was compared to another human oral L. fermentum strain, AGR1485, which does not cause the same effect. The examination of phenotypic traits associated with the composition of cell surface structures showed that compared to AGR1485, AGR1487 had a smaller genome, utilized different sugars, and had greater tolerance to acid and bile. The effect of the two strains on intestinal barrier integrity was determined using two independent measures of paracellular permeability of the intestinal epithelial Caco-2 cell line. The transepithelial electrical resistance (TEER) assay specifically measures ion permeability, whereas the mannitol flux assay measures the passage of uncharged molecules. Both live and UV-inactivated AGR1487 decreased TEER across Caco-2 cells implicating the cell surfaces structures in the effect. However, only live AGR1487, and not UV-inactivated AGR1487, increased the rate of passage of mannitol, implying that a secreted component(s) is responsible for this effect. These differences in barrier integrity results are likely due to the TEER and mannitol flux assays measuring different characteristics of the epithelial barrier, and therefore imply that there are multiple mechanisms involved in the effect of AGR1487 on barrier integrity.","913":"Pseudomonas syringae pv. syringae is a common plant-associated bacterium that causes diseases of both monocot and dicot plants worldwide. To help delineate traits critical to adaptation and survival in the plant environment, we generated complete genome sequences of P. syringae pv. syringae strains B301D and HS191, which represent dicot and monocot strains with distinct host specificities. Intrapathovar comparisons of the B301D (6.09 Mb) and HS191 (5.95 Mb plus a 52 kb pCG131 plasmid) genomes to the previously sequenced B728a genome demonstrated that the shared genes encompass about 83% of each genome, and include genes for siderophore biosynthesis, osmotolerance, and extracellular polysaccharide production. Between 7% and 12% of the genes are unique among the genomes, and most of the unique gene regions carry transposons, phage elements, or IS elements associated with horizontal gene transfer. Differences are observed in the type III effector composition for the three strains that likely influences host range. The HS191 genome had the largest number at 25 of effector genes, and seven effector genes are specific to this monocot strain. Toxin production is another major trait associated with virulence of P. syringae pv. syringae, and HS191 is distinguished by genes for production of syringopeptin SP25 and mangotoxin.","914":null,"915":"Cyanobacteria are an attractive host for biofuel production because they can produce valuable chemical compounds from CO2 fixed by photosynthesis. However, the available genetic tools that enable precise gene regulation for the applications of synthetic biology are insufficient. Previously, we engineered an RNA-based posttranscriptional regulator, termed riboregulator, for the control of target gene expression in cyanobacterium Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. Moreover, we enhanced the gene regulation ability of the riboregulators in Escherichia coli by fusing and engineering a scaffold sequence derived from naturally occurring E. coli noncoding small RNAs. Here, we demonstrated that the scaffold sequence fused to the riboregulators improved their gene regulation ability in Synechocystis sp. PCC 6803. To further improve gene regulation, we expressed an exogenous RNA chaperone protein that is responsible for noncoding small RNA-mediated gene regulation, which resulted in higher target gene expression. The scaffold sequence derived from natural E. coli noncoding small RNAs is effective for designing RNA-based genetic tools and scaffold-fused riboregulators are a strong RNA-tool to regulate gene expression in cyanobacteria.","916":null,"917":"The ability to form multicellular communities known as biofilms is a widespread adaptive behavior of bacteria. Members of the Bacillus group of bacteria have been found to form biofilms on plant roots, where they protect against pathogens and promote growth. In the case of the model bacterium Bacillus subtilis the genetic pathway controlling biofilm formation and the production of an extracellular matrix is relatively well understood. However, it is unclear whether other members of this genus utilize similar mechanisms. We determined that a plant-associated strain of Bacillus cereus (905) can form biofilms by two seemingly independent pathways. In one mode involving the formation of floating biofilms (pellicles) B. cereus 905 appears to rely on orthologs of many of the genes known to be important for B. subtilis biofilm formation. We report that B. cereus 905 also forms submerged, surface-associated biofilms and in a manner that resembles biofilm formation by the pathogen Staphylococcus aureus. This alternative mode, which does not rely on B. subtilis-like genes for pellicle formation, takes place under conditions of glucose fermentation and depends on a drop in the pH of the medium. ","918":"The relative impact of 23 mutations on biofilm formation was evaluated in the USA300, methicillin-resistant strain LAC. Mutation of sarA, atl, codY, rsbU, and sigB limited biofilm formation in comparison to the parent strain, but the limitation imposed by mutation of sarA was greater than that imposed by mutation of any of these other genes. The reduced biofilm formation of all mutants other than the atl mutant was correlated with increased levels of extracellular proteases. Mutation of fur- and mgrA-enhanced biofilm formation but in LAC had no impact on protease activity, nuclease activity, or accumulation of the polysaccharide intercellular adhesin (PIA). The increased capacity of these mutants to form a biofilm was reversed by mutation of sarA, and this was correlated with increased protease production. Mutation of sarA, mgrA, and sigB had the same phenotypic effect in the methicillin-sensitive strain UAMS-1, but mutation of codY increased rather than decreased biofilm formation. As with the UAMS-1 mgrA mutant, this was correlated with increased production of PIA. Examination of four additional clinical isolates suggests that the differential impact of codY on biofilm formation may be a conserved characteristic of methicillin-resistant versus methicillin-sensitive strains.

The analysis of the sampled bacterial communities with a pyrosequencing approach revealed that the most abundant phyla were represented by the Proteobacteria (49.3%), Bacteroidetes (22.9%), Actinobacteria (16.3%), and Firmicutes (8.3%). Cyanobacteria were assigned to 1.5% of all bacterial reads. A core of 37 bacterial OTUs made up more than 75% of all bacterial sequences. The most abundant OTU was Sphingomonas sp. which comprised 17% of all bacterial sequences. The most abundant bacterial genera were attributed to distinctly different areas of origin, suggesting highly heterogeneous sources for bioaerosols of marine and coastal environments. Furthermore, the bacterial community was clearly affected by two environmental parameters - temperature as a function of wind direction and the sampling location itself. However, a comparison of the wind directions during the sampling and calculated backward trajectories underlined the need for more detailed information on environmental parameters for bioaerosol investigations. The current findings support the assumption of a bacterial core community in the atmosphere. They may be emitted from strong aerosolizing sources, probably being mixed and dispersed over long distances.

They show an amazing diversity in their sequence, structure, and mechanism of action. Among them, plant defensins are renowned for their antifungal activity but various side activities have also been described. Usually, a new biological role is reported along with the discovery of a new defensin and it is thus not clear if this multifunctionality exists at the family level or at the peptide level. We previously showed that the plant defensin AhPDF1.1b exhibits an unexpected role by conferring zinc tolerance to yeast and plant cells. In this paper, we further explored this activity using different yeast genetic backgrounds: especially the zrc1 mutant and an UPRE-GFP reporter yeast strain. We showed that AhPDF1.1b interferes with adaptive cell response in the endoplasmic reticulum to confer cellular zinc tolerance. We thus highlighted that, depending on its cellular localization, AhPDF1.1b exerts quite separate activities: when it is applied exogenously, it is a toxin against fungal and also root cells, but when it is expressed in yeast cells, it is a peptide that modulates the cellular adaptive response to zinc overload. ","924":"Outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) are ubiquitously secreted from the outer membrane (OM) of Gram-negative bacteria. These heterogeneous structures are composed of OM filled with periplasmic content from the site of budding. By analyzing mutants that have vesicle production phenotypes, we can gain insight into the mechanism of OMV budding in wild-type cells, which has thus far remained elusive. In this study, we present data demonstrating that the hypervesiculation phenotype of the nlpI deletion mutant of Escherichia coli correlates with changes in peptidoglycan (PG) dynamics. Our data indicate that in stationary phase cultures the nlpI mutant exhibits increased PG synthesis that is dependent on spr, consistent with a model in which NlpI controls the activity of the PG endopeptidase Spr. In log phase, the nlpI mutation was suppressed by a dacB mutation, suggesting that NlpI regulates penicillin-binding protein 4 (PBP4) during exponential growth. The data support a model in which NlpI negatively regulates PBP4 activity during log phase, and Spr activity during stationary phase, and that in the absence of NlpI, the cell survives by increasing PG synthesis. Further, the nlpI mutant exhibited a significant decrease in covalent outer membrane (OM-PG) envelope stabilizing cross-links, consistent with its high level of OMV production. Based on these results, we propose that one mechanism wild-type Gram-negative bacteria can use to modulate vesiculation is by altering PG-OM cross-linking via localized modulation of PG degradation and synthesis.

Among them, Arcobacter, Halomonas, Marinobacterium, Marinobacter, Sphingomonas, Rhodococcus, Pseudomonas, Dietzia, Ochrobactrum, Hyphomonas, Acinetobacter, and Shewanella were dominant, and have the potential to grow using hydrocarbons as carbon sources. Metabolic gene clone libraries indicated that the nitrate-reducing bacteria (NRB) mainly belonged to Pseudomonas, Azospirillum, Bradyrhizobium, Thauera, Magnetospirillum, Sinorhizobium, Azoarcus, and Rhodobacter; the sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB) were Desulfarculus, Desulfomonile, Desulfosarcina, Desulfotignum, Desulfacinum, Desulfatibacillum, Desulfatibacillum, Desulfomicrobium, and Desulfovibrio; while the methanogens were archaea and belonged to Methanomethylovorans, Methanosaeta, Methanococcus, Methanolobus, and Methanobacterium. Real-time quantitative PCR analysis indicated that the number of bacterial 16S rRNA reached 106 copies\/mL, while the metabolic genes of NRB, SRB, and methanogens reached 104 copies\/mL. These results show that the Luliang reservoir has abundant microbial populations associated with oil recovery, suggesting that the reservoir has potential for MEOR.","932":null,"933":null,"934":"The secretion of biomolecules into the extracellular milieu is a common and well-conserved phenomenon in biology. In bacteria, secreted biomolecules are not only involved in intra-species communication but they also play roles in inter-kingdom exchanges and pathogenicity. To date, released products, such as small molecules, DNA, peptides, and proteins, have been well studied in bacteria. However, the bacterial extracellular RNA complement has so far not been comprehensively characterized. Here, we have analyzed, using a combination of physical characterization and high-throughput sequencing, the extracellular RNA complement of both outer membrane vesicle (OMV)-associated and OMV-free RNA of the enteric Gram-negative model bacterium Escherichia coli K-12 substrain MG1655 and have compared it to its intracellular RNA complement. Our results demonstrate that a large part of the extracellular RNA complement is in the size range between 15 and 40 nucleotides and is derived from specific intracellular RNAs. Furthermore, RNA is associated with OMVs and the relative abundances of RNA biotypes in the intracellular, OMV and OMV-free fractions are distinct. Apart from rRNA fragments, a significant portion of the extracellular RNA complement is composed of specific cleavage products of functionally important structural noncoding RNAs, including tRNAs, 4.5S RNA, 6S RNA, and tmRNA. In addition, the extracellular RNA pool includes RNA biotypes from cryptic prophages, intergenic, and coding regions, of which some are so far uncharacterised, for example, transcripts mapping to the fimA-fimL and ves-spy intergenic regions. Our study provides the first detailed characterization of the extracellular RNA complement of the enteric model bacterium E. coli. Analogous to findings in eukaryotes, our results suggest the selective export of specific RNA biotypes by E. coli, which in turn indicates a potential role for extracellular bacterial RNAs in intercellular communication.","935":null,"936":"The bacterial human pathogen Chlamydia trachomatis invades cells as an infectious elementary body (EB). The EB is internalized into a vacuole that is hidden from the host defense mechanism, and is modified to sustain the development of the replicative reticulate body (RB). Inside this parasitophorous compartment, called the inclusion, the pathogen survives supported by an active exchange of nutrients and proteins with the host cell. We show that host lipids are scavenged and modified into bacterial-specific lipids by the action of a shared human-bacterial acylation mechanism. The bacterial acylating enzymes for the essential lipids 1-acyl-sn-glycerol 3-phosphate and 1-acyl-sn-phosphatidylcholine were identified as CT453 and CT775, respectively. Bacterial CT775 was found to be associated with lipid droplets (LDs). During the development of C. trachomatis, the human acyl-CoA carrier hACBD6 was recruited to cytosolic LDs and translocated into the inclusion. hACBD6 protein modulated the activity of CT775 in an acyl-CoA dependent fashion and sustained the activity of the bacterial acyltransferase by buffering the concentration of acyl-CoAs. We propose that disruption of the binding activity of the acyl-CoA carrier might represent a new drug-target to prevent growth of C. trachomatis.","937":"Fumaroles (steam vents) are the most common, yet least understood, microbial habitat in terrestrial geothermal settings. Long believed too extreme for life, recent advances in sample collection and DNA extraction methods have found that fumarole deposits and subsurface waters harbor a considerable diversity of viable microbes. In this study, we applied culture-independent molecular methods to explore fumarole deposit microbial assemblages in 15 different fumaroles in four geographic locations on the Big Island of Hawai'i. Just over half of the vents yielded sufficient high-quality DNA for the construction of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequence clone libraries. The bacterial clone libraries contained sequences belonging to 11 recognized bacterial divisions and seven other division-level phylogenetic groups. Archaeal sequences were less numerous, but similarly diverse. The taxonomic composition among fumarole deposits was highly heterogeneous. Phylogenetic analysis found cloned fumarole sequences were related to microbes identified from a broad array of globally distributed ecotypes, including hot springs, terrestrial soils, and industrial waste sites. Our results suggest that fumarole deposits function as an \"extremophile collector\" and may be a hot spot of novel extremophile biodiversity.","938":null,"939":"The anaerobic oxidation of methane (AOM) is an important sink of methane that plays a significant role in global warming. AOM was first found to be coupled with sulfate reduction and mediated by anaerobic methanotrophic archaea (ANME) and sulfate-reducing bacteria (SRB). ANME, often forming consortia with SRB, are phylogenetically related to methanogenic archaea. ANME-1 is even able to produce methane. Subsequently, it has been found that AOM can also be coupled with denitrification. The known microbes responsible for this process are Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera (M. oxyfera) and Candidatus Methanoperedens nitroreducens (M. nitroreducens). Candidatus Methylomirabilis oxyfera belongs to the NC10 bacteria, can catalyze nitrite reduction through an \"intra-aerobic\" pathway, and may catalyze AOM through an aerobic methane oxidation pathway. However, M. nitroreducens, which is affiliated with ANME-2d archaea, may be able to catalyze AOM through the reverse methanogenesis pathway. Moreover, manganese (Mn(4+) ) and iron (Fe(3+) ) can also be used as electron acceptors of AOM. This review summarizes the mechanisms and associated microbes of AOM. It also discusses recent progress in some unclear key issues about AOM, including ANME-1 in hypersaline environments, the effect of oxygen on M. oxyfera, and the relationship of M. nitroreducens with ANME.","940":"Porphyromonas gingivalis is a keystone periopathogen that plays an essential role in the progress of periodontitis. Like other gram-negative bacteria, the ability of P. gingivalis to produce outer membrane vesicles is a strategy used to interact with, and survive within its biological niches. Here we compared the protein components associated with vesicles derived from a fimbriated strain (33277) and an afimbriated strain (W83) of P. gingivalis using proteomic analyses. Some well-known virulence factors were identified in vesicles from both strains, such as gingipains and hemagglutinin. In contrast, FimC, FimD, and FimE, minor components of long fimbriae were found exclusively in 33277 vesicles, while proteins with a tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain were unique to W83 vesicles. We found that significantly more 33277 than W83 vesicles were internalized into human oral keratinocytes and gingival fibroblasts. Interestingly, FimA, a well-known adhesin responsible for the attachment and invasion of P. gingivalis into host cells, was not essential for the invasive capabilities of P. gingivalis vesicles. Rather minor components of long fimbriae were required for an efficient invasive activity of vesicles. The most striking finding was that P. gingivalis strains lacking or having a reduced FimA expression showed a significant reduction in vesiculation. These results suggest that production and pathogenicity of P. gingivalis vesicles may largely depend on expression of the fim locus, and that the integration of vesicle production and pathogenicity with fimbrial expression may allow P. gingivalis to confer upon itself certain functional advantages. ","941":"Aeromonas caviae is motile via a polar flagellum in liquid culture, with a lateral flagella system used for swarming on solid surfaces. The polar flagellum also has a role in cellular adherence and biofilm formation. The two subunits of the polar flagellum, FlaA and FlaB, are posttranslationally modified by O-linked glycosylation with pseudaminic acid on 6-8 serine and threonine residues within the central region of these proteins. This modification is essential for the formation of the flagellum. Aeromonas caviae possesses the simplest set of genes required for bacterial glycosylation currently known, with the putative glycosyltransferase, Maf1, being described recently. Here, we investigated the role of the AHA0618 gene, which shares homology (37% at the amino acid level) with the central region of a putative deglycosylation enzyme (HP0518) from the human pathogen Helicobacter pylori, which also glycosylates its flagellin and is proposed to be part of a flagellin deglycosylation pathway. Phenotypic analysis of an AHA0618 A. caviae mutant revealed increased swimming and swarming motility compared to the wild-type strain but without any detectable effects on the glycosylation status of the polar flagellins when analyzed by western blot analysis or mass spectroscopy. Bioinformatic analysis of the protein AHA0618, demonstrated homology to a family of l,d-transpeptidases involved in cell wall biology and peptidoglycan cross-linking (YkuD-like). Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) and fluorescence microscopy analysis of the wild-type and AHA0618-mutant A. caviae strains revealed the mutant to be subtly but significantly shorter than wild-type cells; a phenomenon that could be recovered when either AHA0618 or H. pylori HP0518 were introduced. We can therefore conclude that AHA0618 does not affect A. caviae behavior by altering polar flagellin glycosylation levels but is likely to have a role in peptidoglycan processing at the bacterial cell wall, consequently altering cell length and hence influencing motility.","942":"We analyzed the diversity of bacterial epibionts and trophic ecology of a new species of Kiwa yeti crab discovered at two hydrothermal vent fields (E2 and E9) on the East Scotia Ridge (ESR) in the Southern Ocean using a combination of 454 pyrosequencing, Sanger sequencing, and stable isotope analysis. The Kiwa epibiont communities were dominated by Epsilon- and Gammaproteobacteria. About 454 sequencing of the epibionts on 15 individual Kiwa specimen revealed large regional differences between the two hydrothermal vent fields: at E2, the bacterial community on the Kiwa ventral setae was dominated (up to 75%) by Gammaproteobacteria, whereas at E9 Epsilonproteobacteria dominated (up to 98%). Carbon stable isotope analysis of both Kiwa and the bacterial epibionts also showed distinct differences between E2 and E9 in mean and variability. Both stable isotope and sequence data suggest a dominance of different carbon fixation pathways of the epibiont communities at the two vent fields. At E2, epibionts were putatively fixing carbon via the Calvin-Benson-Bassham and reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle, while at E9 the reverse tricarboxylic acid cycle dominated. Co-varying epibiont diversity and isotope values at E2 and E9 also present further support for the hypothesis that epibionts serve as a food source for Kiwa.","943":null,"944":"This study aimed to explore the capability of potentially probiotic bifidobacteria to hydrolyze chlorogenic acid into caffeic acid (CA), and to recognize the enzymes involved in this reaction.

Intracellular feruloyl esterase activity capable of hydrolyzing chlorogenic acid was detected only in B. animalis. In silico research among bifidobacteria esterases identified Balat_0669 as the cytosolic enzyme likely responsible of CA release in B. animalis. Comparative modeling of Balat_0669 and molecular docking studies support its role in chlorogenic acid hydrolysis. Expression, purification, and functional characterization of Balat_0669 in Escherichia coli were obtained as further validation. A possible role of B. animalis in the activation of hydroxycinnamic acids was demonstrated and new perspectives were opened in the development of new probiotics, specifically selected for the enhanced bioconversion of phytochemicals into bioactive compounds.","945":"Plant biomass can be utilized by a lignocellulose-degrading fungus, Phanerochaete chrysosporium, but the metabolic and regulatory mechanisms involved are not well understood. A polyomics-based analysis (metabolomics, proteomics, and transcriptomics) of P. chrysosporium has been carried out using statistically optimized conditions for lignocellulolytic reaction. Thirty-nine metabolites and 123 genes (14 encoded proteins) that consistently exhibited altered regulation patterns were identified. These factors were then integrated into a comprehensive map that fully depicts all signaling cascades involved in P. chrysosporium. Despite the diversity of these cascades, they showed complementary interconnection among themselves, ensuring the efficiency of passive biosystem and thereby yielding energy expenditure for the cells. Particularly, many factors related to intracellular regulatory networks showed compensating activity in homeostatic lignocellulolysis. In the main platform of proactive biosystem, although several deconstruction-related targets (e.g., glycoside hydrolase, ureidoglycolate hydrolase, transporters, and peroxidases) were systematically utilized, well-known supporters (e.g., cellobiose dehydrogenase and ferroxidase) were rarely generated.

To date, however, pathways of archaeal N-glycosylation have only been described for few species. With this in mind, the similarities of N-linked glycans decorating glycoproteins in the haloarchaea Haloferax volcanii and Halobacterium salinarum directed a series of bioinformatics, genetic, and biochemical experiments designed to describe that Hbt. salinarum pathway responsible for biogenesis of one of the two N-linked oligosaccharides described in this species. As in Hfx. volcanii, where agl (archaeal glycosylation) genes that encode proteins responsible for the assembly and attachment of a pentasaccharide to target protein Asn residues are clustered in the genome, Hbt. salinarum also contains a group of clustered homologous genes (VNG1048G-VNG1068G). Introduction of these Hbt. salinarum genes into Hfx. volcanii mutant strains deleted of the homologous sequence restored the lost activity. Moreover, transcription of the Hbt. salinarum genes in the native host, as well as in vitro biochemical confirmation of the predicted functions of several of the products of these genes provided further support for assignments made following bioinformatics and genetic experiments. Based on the results obtained in this study, the first description of an N-glycosylation pathway in Hbt. salinarum is offered.","947":"Alterations in the gut microbiota have been recently linked to oral iron.

We applied denaturing gradient gel electrophoresis and fluorescence in situ hybridization for study-1 and 454-pyrosequencing of fecal 16S rRNA in study-2. In study-1, the within-community microbial diversity increased with FeSO4 (P = 0.0009) but not with Nano Fe(III) supplementation. This was confirmed in study-2, where we also showed that iron depletion at weaning imprinted significantly lower within- and between-community microbial diversity compared to mice weaned onto the iron-sufficient reference diet (P &lt; 0.0001). Subsequent supplementation with FeSO4 partially restored the within-community diversity (P = 0.006 in relation to the continuously iron-depleted group) but not the between-community diversity, whereas Nano Fe(III) had no effect. We conclude that (1) dietary iron depletion at weaning imprints low diversity in the microbiota that is not, subsequently, easily recovered; (2) in the absence of gastrointestinal disease iron supplementation does not negatively impact the microbiota; and (3) Nano Fe(III) is less available to the gut microbiota.","948":null,"949":"Cytochrome c proteins, as enzymes to exchange electrons with substrates or as pure electron carriers to shuttle electrons, play vital roles in bacterial respiration and photosynthesis.

In this study, we identify soluble cytochrome c ScyA as an important factor influencing the nitrite resistance of a strain devoid of the bd oxidase by utilizing a newly developed transposon mutagenesis vector, which enables overexpression of the gene(s) downstream of the insertion site. We show that when in overabundance ScyA facilitates growth against nitrite inhibition by enhancing nitrite resistance of the cbb3 oxidase.

Mutacin 1140 leader peptide is structurally unique compared to other class I lantibiotic leader peptides. Herein, we further our understanding of the structural differences of mutacin 1140 leader peptide with regard to other class I leader peptides.

Several proteins contribute to sRNA stability and regulation, most notably the Hfq RNA-binding protein. However, not all sRNAs rely on Hfq for their stability. It is therefore likely that other proteins contribute to the stability and function of certain bacterial sRNAs. Here, we describe a methodology for identifying in vivo-binding proteins of sRNAs, developed using the iron-responsive PrrF and PrrH sRNAs of Pseudomonas aeruginosa. RNA was isolated from iron-depleted cultures, which were irradiated to cross-link nucleoprotein complexes. Subsequently, PrrF- and PrrH-protein complexes were enriched using cDNA \"bait\", and enriched RNA-protein complexes were analyzed by tandem mass spectrometry to identify PrrF and PrrH associated proteins. This method identified Hfq as a potential PrrF- and PrrH-binding protein. Interestingly, Hfq was identified more often in samples probed with the PrrF cDNA \"bait\" as compared to the PrrH cDNA \"bait\", suggesting Hfq has a stronger binding affinity for the PrrF sRNAs in vivo. Hfq binding to the PrrF and PrrH sRNAs was validated by electrophoretic mobility shift assays with purified Hfq protein from P. aeruginosa. As such, this study demonstrates that in vivo cross-linking coupled with sequence-specific affinity chromatography and tandem mass spectrometry (SSAC-MS\/MS) is an effective methodology for unbiased identification of bacterial sRNA-binding proteins.

In this study, we examine the efficacy of several commonly used protocols for extracting bacterial DNA from ants. While bacterial community composition recovered using Illumina 16S rRNA amplicon sequencing was not detectably biased by any method, the quantity of bacterial DNA varied drastically, reducing the number of samples that could be amplified and sequenced. These results indicate that the concentration necessary for dependable sequencing is around 10,000 copies of target DNA per microliter. Exoskeletal pulverization and tissue digestion increased the reliability of extractions, suggesting that these steps should be included in any study of insect-associated microorganisms that relies on obtaining microbial DNA from intact body segments.

Using protease-deficient derivatives of LAC, we confirmed that this is due to the individual proteases themselves. Purified aureolysin, and to a lesser extent ScpA and SspB, also promoted dispersal of an established biofilm. Mutation of the genes encoding these proteases also only partially restored biofilm formation in an FPR3757 sarA mutant and had little impact on restoring virulence in a murine bacteremia model. In contrast, eliminating the production of all of these proteases fully restored both biofilm formation and virulence in a sarA mutant generated in the closely related USA300 strain LAC. These results confirm an important role for multiple extracellular proteases in S. aureus pathogenesis and the importance of sarA in repressing their production. Moreover, purified aureolysin limited biofilm formation in 14 of 15 methicillin-resistant isolates and 11 of 15 methicillin-susceptible isolates, while dispersin B had little impact in UAMS-1, LAC, or 29 of 30 contemporary isolates of S. aureus. This suggests that the role of sarA and its impact on protease production is important in diverse strains of S. aureus irrespective of their methicillin resistance status. ","957":"In most organisms, heme biosynthesis is strictly controlled so as to avoid heme and heme precursor accumulation, which is toxic. Escherichia coli regulates heme biosynthesis by a feedback loop involving heme-induced proteolytic cleavage of HemA, glutamyl-tRNA reductase, which is the first enzyme in the heme biosynthetic pathway. We show here that heme homeostasis can be disrupted by overproduction of YfeX, a cytoplasmic protein that captures iron from heme that we named deferrochelatase. We also show that it is disrupted by iron chelation, which reduces the intracellular iron concentration necessary for loading iron into protoporphyrin IX (PPIX, the immediate heme precursor). In both cases, we established that there is an increased PPIX concentration and we demonstrate that this compound is expelled by the MacAB-TolC pump, an efflux pump involved in E. coli and Salmonella for macrolide efflux. The E. coli macAB and tolC mutants accumulate PPIX and are sensitive to photo-inactivation. The MacAB-TolC pump is required for Salmonella typhimurium survival in macrophages. We propose that PPIX is an endogenous substrate of the MacAB-TolC pump in E. coli and S. typhimurium and that this compound is produced inside bacteria when natural heme homeostasis is disrupted by iron shortage, as happens when bacteria invade the mammalian host. ","958":"Quorum signaling (QS) describes how bacteria can use small signaling molecules (autoinducers) to coordinate group-level behaviors. In Vibrio fischeri, QS is achieved through a complex regulatory network that ultimately controls bioluminescence, motility, and host colonization. We conducted a genetic screen focused on qrr1, which encodes a small regulatory RNA that is necessary for the core quorum-signaling cascade to transduce autoinducer information into cellular responses. We isolated unique mutants with a transposon inserted into one of two genes within the syp locus, which is involved in biofilm formation. We found that overexpression of sypK, which encodes a putative oligosaccharide translocase, is sufficient to activate qrr1, and, in addition, this effect appears to depend on the kinase activity of the sensor LuxQ. Consistent with the established model for QS in V. fischeri, enhanced expression of qrr1 by the overexpression of sypK resulted in reduced bioluminescence and increased motility. Finally, we found that induction of the syp locus by overexpression of sypG was sufficient to activate qrr1 levels. Together, our results show how conditions that promote biofilm formation impact the quorum-signaling network in V. fischeri, and further highlight the integrated nature of the regulatory circuits involved in complex bacterial behaviors.

The LlpA-like bacteriocin of Pseudomonas aeruginosa C1433, pyocin L1, lacks any similarity to known P. aeruginosa bacteriocins. The initial interaction of pyocin L1 with target cells is mediated by binding to d-rhamnose, present in the common polysaccharide antigen of lipopolysaccharides (LPS), but the actual cytotoxic mechanism is unknown. In this study, we characterized the activity range of pyocin L1 and two additional L pyocins revealed by genome mining, representing two highly diverged LlpA groups in P. aeruginosa. The recombinant proteins exhibit species-specific antagonistic activities down to nanomolar concentrations against clinical and environmental P. aeruginosa strains, including several multidrug-resistant isolates. The overlap in target strain spectrum between two close homologues of the pyocin L1 group is only minimal, contrasting with the considerable spectral redundancy of LlpA proteins reported for other Pseudomonas species. No correlation was found between L pyocin susceptibility and phylogenetic relatedness of P. aeruginosa isolates. Sensitive strains were retrieved in 13 out of 15 O serotypes tested, excluding the possibility that the highly variable and immunogenic O serotype antigen of the LPS coating would represent a dominant susceptibility-discriminating factor. ","962":"Microbial source tracking is an area of research in which multiple approaches are used to identify the sources of elevated bacterial concentrations in recreational lakes and beaches. At our study location in Darwin, northern Australia, water quality in the harbor is generally good, however dry-season beach closures due to elevated Escherichia coli and enterococci counts are a cause for concern. The sources of these high bacteria counts are currently unknown. To address this, we sampled sewage outfalls, other potential inputs, such as urban rivers and drains, and surrounding beaches, and used genetic fingerprints from E. coli and enterococci communities, fecal markers and 454 pyrosequencing to track contamination sources. A sewage effluent outfall (Larrakeyah discharge) was a source of bacteria, including fecal bacteria that impacted nearby beaches. Two other treated effluent discharges did not appear to influence sites other than those directly adjacent. Several beaches contained fecal indicator bacteria that likely originated from urban rivers and creeks within the catchment. Generally, connectivity between the sites was observed within distinct geographical locations and it appeared that most of the bacterial contamination on Darwin beaches was confined to local sources. ","963":"In eukaryotic cells, phosphatidylserine (PS) is predominantly located in the cytosolic leaflet of the plasma membrane; this asymmetry is generated by an unknown mechanism. In this study, we used the PS-specific probe mRFP-Lact-C2 to investigate the possible involvement of type 4 P-type ATPases, also called phospholipid flippases, in the generation of this asymmetry in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. PS was not found in the trans-Golgi Network in wild-type cells, but it became exposed when vesicle formation was compromised in the sec7 mutant, and it was also exposed on secretory vesicles (SVs), as reported previously. However, flippase mutations did not reduce the exposure of PS in either case, even at low levels that would only be detectable by quantitative analysis of mRFP-Lact-C2 fluorescence in isolated SVs. Furthermore, no reduction in the PS level was observed in a mutant with multiple flippase mutations. Because PS was not exposed in a mutant that accumulates ER or cis\/medial-Golgi membranes, Golgi maturation seems to be a prerequisite for PS translocation. Our results suggest that an unknown mechanism, possibly a protein with flippase-like activity, acts in conjunction with known flippases to regulate PS translocation.

All VirB proteins localized to a cell pole, although these conclusions are in dispute. To study subcellular location of the VirB proteins and to identify determinants of their subcellular location, we tagged two proteins, VirB4 and VirB11, with the visual marker green fluorescent protein (GFP) and studied localization of the fusion proteins by epifluorescence microscopy. Both GFP-VirB4 and GFP-VirB11 fusions localized to a single cell pole. GFP-VirB11 was also functional in DNA transfer. To identify the polar localization domains (PLDs) of VirB4 and VirB11, we analyzed fusions of GFP with smaller segments of the two proteins. Two noncontiguous regions in VirB4, residues 236-470 and 592-789, contain PLDs. The VirB11 PLD mapped to a 69 amino acid segment, residues 149-217, in the central region of the protein. These domains are probably involved in interactions that target the two proteins to a cell pole.

However, heterotrophic protists-unlike autotrophic ones-are often difficult to track since they tend to lack features such as photosynthetic pigments that allow for remote sensing or for bulk characterization. Difficulty in the identification of heterotrophic protists has often resulted in lumping them into broad groups, but there is a strong need to develop methods that increase the spatial and temporal resolution of observations applied to particular organisms in order to discover the drivers of population structure and ecological function. In surveys of small subunit rRNA, gene (SSU) sequences of microbial eukaryotes from the Columbia River to the Pacific Ocean, the heterotrophic flagellate Katablepharis sp. were found to dominate protist assemblages (including autotrophic and heterotrophic fractions) in the spring, prior to the freshet. We discovered a 332 base pair unique sequence element (USE) insertion in the large subunit rRNA gene (28S) that is not present in other katablepharids or in any other eukaryote. Using this USE, we were able to detect Katablepharis within mixed assemblages in river, estuarine, and oceanic samples and determine spatial and temporal patterns in absolute abundance through quantitative PCR and fluorescence in situ hybridization. Given their high abundance and repeatable temporal patterns of occurrence, we hypothesize that the Columbia River Estuary Katablepharis (Katablepharis CRE) plays an important role in estuarine biogeochemical and ecosystem function.

The complete genomic context of this organism was however, not yet available. The sequencing of the D. gigas genome provides insights into the integrated network of energy conserving complexes and structures present in this bacterium. Comparison with genomes of other Desulfovibrio spp. reveals the presence of two different CRISPR\/Cas systems in D. gigas. Phylogenetic analysis using conserved protein sequences (encoded by rpoB and gyrB) indicates two main groups of Desulfovibrio spp, being D. gigas more closely related to D. vulgaris and D. desulfuricans strains. Gene duplications were found such as those encoding fumarate reductase, formate dehydrogenase, and superoxide dismutase. Complexes not yet described within Desulfovibrio genus were identified: Mnh complex, a v-type ATP-synthase as well as genes encoding the MinCDE system that could be responsible for the larger size of D. gigas when compared to other members of the genus. A low number of hydrogenases and the absence of the codh\/acs and pfl genes, both present in D. vulgaris strains, indicate that intermediate cycling mechanisms may contribute substantially less to the energy gain in D. gigas compared to other Desulfovibrio spp. This might be compensated by the presence of other unique genomic arrangements of complexes such as the Rnf and the Hdr\/Flox, or by the presence of NAD(P)H related complexes, like the Nuo, NfnAB or Mnh. ","976":"Wastewater treatment reduces environmental contamination by removing gross solids and mitigating the effects of pollution. Treatment also reduces the number of indicator organisms and pathogens. In this work, the fates of two coliform bacteria, Escherichia coli and Serratia marcescens, were analyzed in an activated sludge process to determine the main mechanisms involved in the reduction of pathogenic microorganisms during wastewater treatment. These bacteria, modified to express green fluorescent protein, were inoculated in an activated sludge unit and in batch systems containing wastewater. The results suggested that, among the different biological factors implied in bacterial removal, bacterivorous protozoa play a key role. Moreover, a representative number of bacteria persisted in the system as free-living or embedded cells, but their distribution into liquid or solid fractions varied depending on the bacterium tested, questioning the real value of bacterial indicators for the control of wastewater treatment process. Additionally, viable but nonculturable cells constituted an important part of the bacterial population adhered to solid fractions, what can be derived from the competition relationships with native bacteria, present in high densities in this environment. These facts, taken together, emphasize the need for reliable quantitative and qualitative analysis tools for the evaluation of pathogenic microbial composition in sludge, which could represent an undefined risk to public health and ecosystem functions when considering its recycling. ","977":"Paenibacillus larvae is the etiological agent of American Foulbrood (AFB) a world-wide distributed devastating disease of the honey bee brood. Previous comparative genome analysis and more recently, the elucidation of the bacterial genome, provided evidence that this bacterium harbors putative functional nonribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) and polyketide synthases (PKSs) and therefore, might produce nonribosomal peptides (NRPs) and polyketides (PKs). Such biosynthesis products have been shown to display a wide-range of biological activities such as antibacterial, antifungal or cytotoxic activity. Herein we present an in silico analysis of the first NRPS\/PKS hybrid of P. larvae and we show the involvement of this cluster in the production of a compound named paenilamicin (Pam). For the characterization of its in vitro and in vivo bioactivity, a knock-out mutant strain lacking the production of Pam was constructed and subsequently compared to wild-type species. This led to the identification of Pam by mass spectrometry. Purified Pam-fractions showed not only antibacterial but also antifungal and cytotoxic activities. The latter suggested a direct effect of Pam on honey bee larval death which could, however, not be corroborated in laboratory infection assays. Bee larvae infected with the non-producing Pam strain showed no decrease in larval mortality, but a delay in the onset of larval death. We propose that Pam, although not essential for larval mortality, is a virulence factor of P. larvae influencing the time course of disease. These findings are not only of significance in elucidating and understanding host-pathogen interactions but also within the context of the quest for new compounds with antibiotic activity for drug development.

Trypanosoma brucei is an early-branching eukaryote with four characterized protein arginine methyltransferases (PRMTs), one additional putative PRMT, and over 800 arginine methylated proteins, suggesting that arginine methylation has widespread impacts in this organism. While much is known about the activities of individual T. brucei PRMTs (TbPRMTs), little is known regarding how TbPRMTs function together in vivo. In this study, we analyzed single and selected double TbPRMT knockdowns for the impact on expression of TbPRMTs and global methylation status. Repression of TbPRMT1 caused a decrease in asymmetric dimethylarginine and a marked increase in monomethylarginine that was catalyzed by TbPRMT7, suggesting that TbPRMT1 and TbPRMT7 can compete for the same substrate. We also observed an unexpected and strong interdependence between TbPRMT1 and TbPRMT3 protein levels. This finding, together with the observation of similar methyl landscape profiles in TbPRMT1 and TbPRMT3 repressed cells, strongly suggests that these two enzymes form a functional complex. We show that corepression of TbPRMT6\/7 synergistically impacts growth of procyclic-form T. brucei. Our findings also implicate the actions of noncanonical, and as yet unidentified, PRMTs in T. brucei. Together, our studies indicate that TbPRMTs display a functional interplay at multiple levels.

Herein, we report a study showing that a majority of differences in soil microbial community functional structures, measured by a functional gene array named GeoChip 4.0, in two adjacent shrubland and grassland areas, were explainable by environmental properties, suggesting that the harsh environments in the alpine grassland rendered niche adaptation important. Furthermore, genes involved in labile carbon degradation were more abundant in the shrubland than those of the grassland but genes involved in recalcitrant carbon degradation were less abundant, which was conducive to long-term carbon storage and sequestration in the shrubland despite low soil organic carbon content. In addition, genes of anerobic nitrogen cycling processes such as denitrification and dissimilatory nitrogen reduction were more abundant, shifting soil nitrogen cycling toward ammonium biosynthesis and consequently leading to higher soil ammonium contents. We also noted higher abundances of stress genes responsive to nitrogen limitation and oxygen limitation, which might be attributed to low total nitrogen and higher water contents in the shrubland. Together, these results provide mechanistic knowledge about microbial linkages to soil carbon and nitrogen storage and potential consequences of vegetation shifts in the Tibetan alpine meadow.

However, the observed toxicities of the three mutants against B. mori larvae and cultured cells expressing the BtR175 toxin-binding region did not increase, suggesting that increased binding affinity to cadherins does not contribute to the insecticidal activity. Affinity maturation of a Cry toxin to a receptor via directed evolution was relatively simple to achieve, and seems to have potential for generating a toxin with increased insecticidal activity. ","982":"Nontypeable Hemophilus influenzae (NTHi) is a Gram-negative bacterial pathogen that causes chronic biofilm infections of the ears and airways. The biofilm matrix provides structural integrity to the biofilm and protects biofilm cells from antibiotic exposure by reducing penetration of antimicrobial compounds into the biofilm. Extracellular DNA (eDNA) has been found to be a major matrix component of biofilms formed by many species of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, including NTHi. Interestingly, the cation chelator ethylenediaminetetra-acetic acid (EDTA) has been shown to reduce the matrix strength of biofilms of several bacterial species as well as to have bactericidal activity against various pathogens. EDTA exerts its antimicrobial activity by chelating divalent cations necessary for growth and membrane stability and by destabilizing the matrix thus enhancing the detachment of bacterial cells from the biofilm. In this study, we have explored the role of divalent cations in NTHi biofilm development and stability. We have utilized in vitro static and continuous flow models of biofilm development by NTHi to demonstrate that magnesium cations enhance biofilm formation by NTHi. We found that the divalent cation chelator EDTA is effective at both preventing NTHi biofilm formation and at treating established NTHi biofilms. Furthermore, we found that the matrix destablilizers EDTA and DNaseI increase the susceptibility of NTHi biofilms to ampicillin and ciprofloxacin. Our observations indicate that DNaseI and EDTA enhance the efficacy of antibiotic treatment of NTHi biofilms. These observations may lead to new strategies that will improve the treatment options available to patients with chronic NTHi infections.

Chlamydial infections are probably initiated by binding of the bacterial outer membrane protein OmcB to host cell glycosaminoglycans (GAGs). Here, we show that all nine members of the polymorphic membrane protein (Pmp) family of C. trachomatis mediate adhesion to human epithelial and endothelial cells. Importantly, exposure of infectious particles to soluble recombinant Pmps blocks subsequent infection, thus implicating an important function of the entire protein family in the infection process. Analogous experiments with pairs of recombinant Pmps or a combination of Pmp and OmcB revealed that all Pmps probably act in an adhesion pathway that is distinct from the OmcB-GAG pathway. Finally, we provide evidence that the Pmps of C. trachomatis and C. pneumoniae exhibit species and tissue specificity. These findings argue for the involvement of C. trachomatis Pmps in the initial phase of infection and suggest that they may interact with a receptor other than the epidermal growth factor receptor recently identified for their counterparts in C. pneumoniae.

A distinctive feature of these Gram-positive bacteria is the presence of an outer membrane of unique structure and composition. Recently, resistance-nodulation-division (RND) transporters (nicknamed MmpLs, Mycobacterial membrane protein Large) have emerged as major contributors to the biogenesis of the outer membranes in mycobacteria and as promising drug targets. In this study, we investigated the role of RND transporters in the physiology of Corynebacterium glutamicum and analyzed properties of these proteins. Our results show that in contrast to Gram-negative species, in which RND transporters actively extrude antibiotics from cells, in C. glutamicum and relatives these transporters protect cells from antibiotics by playing essential roles in the biogenesis of the low-permeability barrier of the outer membrane. Conditional C. glutamicum mutants lacking RND proteins and with the controlled expression of either NCgl2769 (CmpL1) or NCgl0228 (CmpL4) are hypersusceptible to multiple antibiotics, have growth deficiencies in minimal medium and accumulate intracellularly trehalose monocorynomycolates, free corynomycolates, and the previously uncharacterized corynomycolate-containing lipid.

In addition to alginate, P. putida is capable of producing cellulose (bcs), putida exopolysaccharide a (pea), and putida exopolysaccharide b (peb). However, unlike alginate, not much is known about their roles under water limitation. Hence, in this study we examined the role of different EPS components under mild water limitation. To create environmentally realistic water limited conditions as observed in soil, we used the Pressurized Porous Surface Model. Our main hypothesis was that under water limitation and in the absence of alginate other exopolysaccharides would be more active to maintain homeostasis. To test our hypothesis, we investigated colony morphologies and whole genome transcriptomes of P. putida KT2440 wild type and its mutants deficient in synthesis of either alginate or all known EPS. Overall our results support that alginate is an important exopolysaccharide under water limitation and in the absence of alginate other tolerance mechanisms are activated.

Bacteria secrete a large number of different chemical species, and the local concentrations of these compounds at the surfaces of nearby cells may reach very high levels. It is fascinating to imagine how individual cells might sense and respond to the complex mix of signals at their surface. However, it is difficult to measure exactly what the local environmental composition looks like, or what the effects of individual compounds on nearby cells are. Here, an electron microscopy imaging screen was designed that would detect morphological changes induced by secreted small molecules. This differs from conventional approaches by detecting structural changes in individual cells rather than gene expression or growth rate changes at the population level. For example, one of the changes detected here was an increase in outer membrane vesicle production, which does not necessarily correspond to a change in gene expression. This initial study focussed on Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, and Burkholderia dolosa, and revealed an intriguing range of effects of secreted small molecules on cells both within and between species.

Detection of microcystin biosynthetic genes in water blooms of cyanobacteria is generally indicative of the presence of potentially toxic cyanobacterial strains. Although much effort has been devoted toward elucidating the microcystin biosynthesis mechanisms in many cyanobacteria genera, little is known about the impacts of co-occurring cyanobacteria on cellular growth, mcy gene expression, or mcy gene copy distribution. The present study utilized conventional microscopy, qPCR assays, and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay to study how competition between microcystin-producing Microcystis aeruginosa CPCC 299 and Planktothrix agardhii NIVA-CYA 126 impacts mcyE gene expression, mcyE gene copies, and microcystin concentration under controlled laboratory conditions. Furthermore, analyses of environmental water samples from the Missisquoi Bay, Quebec, enabled us to determine how the various potential toxigenic cyanobacterial biomass proxies correlated with cellular microcystin concentrations in a freshwater lake. Results from our laboratory study indicated significant downregulation of mcyE gene expression in mixed cultures of M. aeruginosa plus P. agardhii on most sampling days in agreement with depressed growth recorded in the mixed cultures, suggesting that interaction between the two species probably resulted in suppressed growth and mcyE gene expression in the mixed cultures. Furthermore, although mcyE gene copies and McyE transcripts were detected in all laboratory and field samples with measureable microcystin levels, only mcyE gene copies showed significant positive correlations (R(2) &gt; 0.7) with microcystin concentrations, while McyE transcript levels did not. These results suggest that mcyE gene copies are better indicators of potential risks from microcystins than McyE transcript levels or conventional biomass proxies, especially in water bodies comprising mixed assemblages of toxic and nontoxic cyanobacteria.","994":"Diseases of lobster shells have a significant impact on fishing industries but the risk of disease transmission between different lobster species has yet to be properly investigated. This study compared bacterial biofilm communities from American (Homarus americanus) and European lobsters (H. gammarus), to assess both healthy cuticle and diseased cuticle during lesion formation. Culture-independent molecular techniques revealed diversity in the bacterial communities of cuticle biofilms both within and between the two lobster species, and identified three bacterial genera associated with shell lesions plus two putative beneficial bacterial species (detected exclusively in healthy cuticle or healing damaged cuticle). In an experimental aquarium shared between American and European lobsters, heterospecific transmission of potentially pathogenic bacteria appeared to be very limited; however, the claws of European lobsters were more likely to develop lesions when reared in the presence of American lobsters. Aquarium biofilms were also examined but revealed no candidate pathogens for environmental transmission. Aquimarina sp.

Contact with S. gordonii initiates signal transduction within P. gingivalis that is based on protein tyrosine (de)phosphorylation. In this study, we characterize a bacterial tyrosine (BY) kinase (designated Ptk1) of P. gingivalis and demonstrate its involvement in interspecies signaling. Ptk1 can utilize ATP for autophosphorylation and is dephosphorylated by the P. gingivalis tyrosine phosphatase, Ltp1. Community development with S. gordonii is severely abrogated in a ptk1 mutant of P. gingivalis, indicating that tyrosine kinase activity is required for maximal polymicrobial synergy. Ptk1 controls the levels of the transcriptional regulator CdhR and the fimbrial adhesin Mfa1 which mediates binding to S. gordonii. The ptk1 gene is in an operon with two genes involved in exopolysaccharide synthesis, and similar to other BY kinases, Ptk1 is necessary for exopolysaccharide production in P. gingivalis. Ptk1 can phosphorylate the capsule related proteins PGN_0224, a UDP-acetyl-mannosamine dehydrogenase, and PGN_0613, a UDP-glucose dehydrogenase, in P. gingivalis. Knockout of ptk1 in an encapsulated strain of P. gingivalis resulted in loss of capsule production.

We here investigated the effect of the copper surface structure on the efficiency of contact killing of Escherichia coli, an aspect which so far has received very little attention. It was shown that electroplated copper surfaces killed bacteria more rapidly than either polished copper or native rolled copper. The release of ionic copper was also more rapid from electroplated copper compared to the other materials.

To investigate the organization of the E. coli enzyme complexes of aerobic OXPHOS in vivo, we established fluorescent protein fusions of the NADH:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, the succinate:ubiquinone oxidoreductase, the cytochrome bd-I, and the cytochrome bo3 terminal oxidases, and the FoF1 ATP-synthase. The fusions were integrated in the chromosome to prevent artifacts caused by protein overproduction. Biochemical analysis revealed that all modified complexes were fully assembled, active, and stable. The distribution of the OXPHOS complexes in living cells was determined using total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy. The dynamics within the membrane were detected by fluorescence recovery after photobleaching.

Sequences related to metabolism of amino acids, nitrogen, and DNA and stress resistance were more frequent in Caatinga soil, while the forest sample showed the highest occurrence of hits annotated in phosphorous metabolism, defense mechanisms, and aromatic compound degradation subsystems. The principal component analysis (PCA) showed that our samples are close to the desert metagenomes in relation to taxonomy, but are more similar to rhizosphere microbiota in relation to the functional profiles. The data indicate that soil characteristics affect the taxonomic and functional distribution; these characteristics include low nutrient content, high drainage (both are sandy soils), vegetation, and exposure to stress. In both samples, a rapid turnover of organic matter with low greenhouse gas emission was suggested by the functional profiles obtained, reinforcing the importance of preserving natural areas. ","1003":"In the course of our studies on mitochondrial defects, we have observed important phenotypic variations in Saccharomyces cerevisiae strains suggesting that a better characterization of the genetic variability will be essential to define the relationship between the mitochondrial efficiency and the presence of different nuclear backgrounds. In this manuscript, we have extended the study of such relations by comparing phenotypic assays related to mitochondrial functions of three wild-type laboratory strains. In addition to the phenotypic variability among the wild-type strains, important differences have been observed among strains bearing identical mitochondrial tRNA mutations that could be related only to the different nuclear background of the cells. Results showed that strains exhibited an intrinsic variability in the severity of the effects of the mitochondrial mutations and that specific strains might be used preferentially to evaluate the phenotypic effect of mitochondrial mutations on carbon metabolism, stress responses, and mitochondrial DNA stability. In particular, while W303-1B and MCC123 strains should be used to study the effect of severe mitochondrial tRNA mutations, D273-10B\/A1 strain is rather suitable for studying the effects of milder mutations. ","1004":"Nitrogen catabolite repression (NCR) is the regulatory pathway through which Saccharomyces cerevisiae responds to the available nitrogen status and selectively utilizes rich nitrogen sources in preference to poor ones. Expression of NCR-sensitive genes is mediated by two transcription activators, Gln3 and Gat1, in response to provision of a poorly used nitrogen source or following treatment with the TORC1 inhibitor, rapamycin. During nitrogen excess, the transcription activators are sequestered in the cytoplasm in a Ure2-dependent fashion. Here, we show that Vps components are required for Gln3 localization and function in response to rapamycin treatment when cells are grown in defined yeast nitrogen base but not in complex yeast peptone dextrose medium. On the other hand, Gat1 function was altered in vps mutants in all conditions tested. A significant fraction of Gat1, like Gln3, is associated with light intracellular membranes. Further, our results are consistent with the possibility that Ure2 might function downstream of the Vps components during the control of GATA factor-mediated gene expression. These observations demonstrate distinct media-dependent requirements of vesicular trafficking components for wild-type responses of GATA factor localization and function. As a result, the current model describing participation of Vps system components in events associated with translocation of Gln3 into the nucleus following rapamycin treatment or growth in nitrogen-poor medium requires modification. ","1005":"Staphylococcus aureus is a clinically important bacterium that is commensal in both humans and animals. Bacteriophage (phage) attachment to the host bacterial surface is an important process during phage infection, which involves interactions between phage receptor-binding proteins and host receptor molecules. However, little information is available on the receptor-binding protein of S. aureus phages. S. aureus virulent phages S24-1 and S13' (family Podoviridae, genus AHJD-like viruses) were isolated from sewage. In the present study, we investigated the receptor-binding protein of AHJD-like viruses using phage S24-1. First, based on a comparative genomic analysis of phages S24-1 and S13', open reading frame 16 (ORF16) of phage S24-1 was speculated to be the receptor-binding protein, which possibly determines the host range. Second, we demonstrated that this was the receptor-binding protein of phage S24-1. Third, our study suggested that wall teichoic acids in the cell walls of S. aureus are the main receptor molecules for ORF16 and phage S24-1. Finally, the C-terminal region of ORF16 may be essential for binding to S. aureus. These results strongly suggest that ORF16 of phage S24-1 and its homologs may be the receptor-binding proteins of AHJD-like viruses.

Isolates were compared using 16S rRNA gene sequencing, repetitive sequence-based polymerase chain reaction (rep-PCR), and phenotypic microarrays. Analysis of 16S rRNA gene sequences revealed high sequence identity in these Bacteroides; with distinct phylogenetic groupings by bacterial species but not host origin. Phenotypic microarray analysis demonstrated these Bacteroides shared the ability to utilize many of the same carbon substrates, without differences due to species or host origin, indicative of their broad carbohydrate fermentation abilities. Limited nitrogen substrates were utilized; in addition to ammonia, guanine, and xanthine, purine derivatives were utilized by most isolates followed by a few amino sugars. Only rep-PCR analysis demonstrated host-specific patterns, indicating that genomic changes due to coevolution with host did not occur by mutation in the 16S rRNA gene or by a gain or loss of carbohydrate utilization genes within these Bacteroides. This is the first report to indicate that host-associated genomic differences are outside of 16S rRNA gene and carbohydrate utilization genes and suggest conservation of specific bacterial species with the same functionality across mammalian hosts for this Bacteroidetes clade. ","1010":"Staphylococcus lugdunensis is both a commensal of humans and an opportunistic pathogen. Little is currently known about the molecular mechanisms underpinning the virulence of this bacterium. Here, we demonstrate that in contrast to S. aureus, S. lugdunensis makes neither staphyloferrin A (SA) nor staphyloferrin B (SB) in response to iron deprivation, owing to the absence of the SB gene cluster, and a large deletion in the SA biosynthetic gene cluster. As a result, the species grows poorly in serum-containing media, and this defect was complemented by introduction of the S. aureus SA gene cluster into S. lugdunensis. S. lugdunensis expresses the HtsABC and SirABC transporters for SA and SB, respectively; the latter gene set is found within the isd (heme acquisition) gene cluster. An isd deletion strain was significantly debilitated for iron acquisition from both heme and hemoglobin, and was also incapable of utilizing ferric-SB as an iron source, while an hts mutant could not grow on ferric-SA as an iron source. In iron-restricted coculture experiments, S. aureus significantly enhanced the growth of S. lugdunensis, in a manner dependent on staphyloferrin production by S. aureus, and the expression of the cognate transporters by S. lugdunensis.","1011":null,"1012":null,"1013":null,"1014":null,"1015":null,"1016":"Francisella tularensis, the etiologic agent of tularemia, can survive under acidic conditions. Tularemia can be acquired by several routes, including by ingestion of contaminated food or water. While acid resistance is usually associated with a low oral infective dose (ID), the ID for gastrointestinal illness is quite high. In this study, four strains of F. tularensis ssp. tularensis (type A) and four strains of F. tularensis ssp. holarctica (type B) were examined for innate acid resistance and the ability to survive in synthetic gastric fluid (SGF) under in vitro conditions similar to passage through the human stomach. Survival for all strains was significantly less in pH 2.5 SGF than in pH 2.5 phosphate-buffered saline and pH 4.0 SGF. Attenuated strains were consistently less resistant. Type B strains are most often associated with waterborne outbreaks and were examined after storage in natural water. Low-nutrient preadaptation resulted in increased resistance. Although F. tularensis can persist under certain acidic conditions, it is sensitive to conditions replicating the fasting human stomach. This may help explain the high ID required for gastrointestinal infections.

Using TAP tagging we show that ParB is expressed in Xac. Disruption of parB increased the cell doubling time and precluded the ability of Xac to colonize the host citrus. Moreover, Xac mutant cells expressing only truncated forms of ParB exhibited the classical phenotype of aberrant chromosome organization, and seemed affected in cell division judged by their reduced growth rate and the propensity to form filaments. The ParB-GFP localization pattern in Xac was suggestive of an asymmetric mode of replicon partitioning, which together with the filamentation phenotype support the idea that Xac may control septum placement using mechanisms probably analogous to Caulobacter crescentus, and perhaps Vibrio cholerae, and Corynebacterium glutamicum. Xac exhibits asymmetric chromosome segregation, and the perturbation of this process leads to an inability to colonize the host plant. ","1025":"Escherichia coli and related enteric bacteria can survive under extreme acid stress condition at least for several hours. RpoS is a key factor for acid stress management in many enterobacteria. Although three rpoS-activating sRNAs, DsrA, RprA, and ArcZ, have been identified in E. coli, it remains unclear how these small RNA molecules participate in pathways leading to acid resistance (AR). Here, we showed that overexpression of ArcZ, DsrA, or RprA enhances AR in a RpoS-dependent manner. Mutant strains with deletion of any of three sRNA genes showed lowered AR, and deleting all three sRNA genes led to more severe defects in protecting against acid stress. Overexpression of any of the three sRNAs fully rescued the acid tolerance defects of the mutant strain lacking all three genes, suggesting that all three sRNAs perform the same function in activating RpoS required for AR. Notably, acid stress led to the induction of DsrA and RprA but not ArcZ.

This study focused on revealing the biological nature of the suppression against Fusarium wilt disease, which is caused by the fungus Fusarium oxysporum, and describing the factors that may influence the fungal pathogen in the MPM system. We demonstrated that the rhizosphere microbiota that developed in the MPM system could suppress Fusarium wilt disease under in vitro and greenhouse conditions. The microbiological characteristics of the MPM system were able to control the population dynamics of F. oxysporum, but did not eradicate the fungal pathogen. The roles of the microbiological agents underlying the disease suppression and the magnitude of the disease suppression in the MPM system appear to depend on the microbial density. F. oxysporum that survived in the MPM system formed chlamydospores when exposed to the rhizosphere microbiota. These results suggest that the microbiota suppresses proliferation of F. oxysporum by controlling the pathogen's morphogenesis and by developing an ecosystem that permits coexistence with F. oxysporum.

Characterization of Mycobacterium tuberculosis isolates circulating in this area will contribute to understand and control the spread of the strains. The aims of this study were to understand the genetic diversity and drug susceptibility of M. tuberculosis isolates circulating in Iran and to analyze the relationship between genotype and drug resistance. A total of 291 M. tuberculosis isolates collected from TB patients were genotyped by spoligotyping. Drug susceptibility testing was performed using proportion method. Spoligotyping resulted in 75 distinct patterns. 86.2% of isolates were grouped in 35 clusters while the remaining isolates were unique. Ural was found to be the most predominant lineage (34.3%) followed by Central Asian strain (CAS) (24%), T (18.2%), Manu2 (7.5%) and Latin American-Mediterranean (LAM) (6.1%). The five largest clusters were Ural\/Spoligotype International Type (SIT)127 (15.8%), CAS1\/SIT26 (9.2%), T1\/SIT53 (6.1%), T1\/SIT284 (5.4%), and CAS1\/SIT25 (4.4%). About 5% of isolates had multidrug resistance (MDR) and 10% had other resistance. MDR was significantly associated with Beijing strains, but not with Ural family. This study highlights dominance of Ural, CAS, and T families in Iran. Biogeographic specificity of CAS and T families to border provinces of Iran including Sistan-Baluchestan and Kermanshah, respectively, suggested that this family strains might be transmitted from these regions to other provinces of the country.

There is a pressing need for a P. aeruginosa reference panel to harmonize and coordinate the collective efforts of the P. aeruginosa research community. We have collated a panel of 43 P. aeruginosa strains that reflects the organism's diversity. In addition to the commonly studied clones, this panel includes transmissible strains, sequential CF isolates, strains with specific virulence characteristics, and strains that represent serotype, genotype or geographic diversity.

The symbiotic prokaryotic communities of X. muta were significantly different than the surrounding bacterioplankton communities while an analysis of similarity (ANOSIM) of the sponge prokaryotic symbionts from three geographically distant sites showed that both symbiont and bacterioplankton populations were significantly different between locations. Comparisons of individual sponges based on the UniFrac P-test also revealed significant differences in community composition between individual sponges. The sponges harbored a variety of phylum level operational taxonomic units (OTUs) common to many sponges, including Cyanobacteria, Poribacteria, Acidobacteria, Chloroflexi, and Gemmatimonadetes, but four additional symbiotic phyla, previously not reported for this sponge, were observed. Additionally, a diverse archaeal community was also recovered from X. muta including sequences representing the phyla Euryarchaeota and Thaumarchaeota. These results have important ecological implications for the understanding of host-microbe associations, and provide a foundation for future studies addressing the functional roles these symbiotic prokaryotes have in the biology of the host sponge and the nutrient biogeochemistry of coral reefs. ","1034":"Upon ultraviolet (UV) stress, hyperthermophilic Sulfolobus species show a highly induced transcription of a gene cluster responsible for pili biogenesis: the UV-inducible pili operon (ups operon). This operon is involved in UV-induced pili assembly, cellular aggregation, and subsequent DNA exchange between cells. As the system increases the fitness of Sulfolobus cells after UV light exposure, we assume that transfer of DNA takes place in order to repair UV-induced DNA damages via homologous recombination. Here, we studied all genes present in the ups cluster via gene deletion analysis with a focus on UpsX, a protein that shows no identifiable functional domains. UspX does not seem to be structurally essential for UV-induced pili formation and cellular aggregation, but appears to be important for efficient DNA transfer. In addition, we could show that pilin subunits UpsA and UpsB probably both function as major pilin subunits in the ups pili. ","1035":"The cytoplasmic PASC domain of the fumarate responsive sensor kinase DcuS of Escherichia coli links the transmembrane to the kinase domain. PASC is also required for interaction with the transporter DctA serving as a cosensor of DcuS. Earlier studies suggested that PASC functions as a hinge and transmits the signal to the kinase. Reorganizing the PASC dimer interaction and, independently, removal of DctA, converts DcuS to the constitutive ON state (active without fumarate stimulation). ON mutants were categorized with respect to these two biophysical interactions and the functional state of DcuS: type I-ON mutations grossly reorganize the homodimer, and decrease interaction with DctA. Type IIA-ON mutations create the ON state without grossly reorganizing the homodimer, whereas interaction with DctA is decreased. The type IIB-ON mutations were neither in PASC \/PASC , nor in DctA\/DcuS interaction affected, similar to fumarate activated wild-typic DcuS. OFF mutations never affected dimer stability. The ON mutations provide novel mechanistic insight: PASC dimerization is essential to silence the kinase. Reorganizing the homodimer and its interaction with DctA activate the kinase. The study suggests a novel ON homo-dimer conformation (type IIB) and an OFF conformation for PASC . Type IIB-ON corresponds to the fumarate induced wild-type conformation, representing an interesting target for structural biology. ","1036":"Nuclease colicins bind their target receptor BtuB in the outer membrane of sensitive Escherichia coli cells in the form of a high-affinity complex with their cognate immunity proteins. The release of the immunity protein from the colicin complex is a prerequisite for cell entry of the colicin and occurs via a process that is still relatively poorly understood. We have previously shown that an energy input in the form of the cytoplasmic membrane proton motive force is required to promote immunity protein (Im9) release from the colicin E9\/Im9 complex and colicin cell entry. We report here that engineering rigidity in the structured part of the colicin translocation domain via the introduction of disulfide bonds prevents immunity protein release from the colicin complex. Reduction of the disulfide bond by the addition of DTT leads to immunity protein release and resumption of activity. Similarly, the introduction of a disulfide bond in the DNase domain previously shown to abolish channel formation in planar bilayers also prevented immunity protein release. Importantly, all disulfide bonds, in the translocation as well as the DNase domain, also abolished the biological activity of the Im9-free colicin E9, the reduction of which led to a resumption of activity. Our results show, for the first time, that conformational flexibility in the structured translocation and DNase domains of a nuclease colicin is essential for immunity protein release, providing further evidence for the hypothesis that global structural rearrangement of the colicin molecule is required for disassembly of this high-affinity toxin-immunity protein complex prior to outer membrane translocation.","1037":null,"1038":"When access to molecular oxygen is restricted, Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) can respire an alternative electron acceptor, nitrate. We found that Mtb within infected primary human macrophages in vitro at physiologic tissue oxygen tensions respired nitrate, generating copious nitrite. A strain of Mtb lacking a functioning nitrate reductase was more susceptible than wild-type Mtb to treatment with isoniazid during infection of macrophages. Likewise, nitrate reductase-deficient Mtb was more susceptible to isoniazid than wild-type Mtb in axenic culture, and more resistant to hydrogen peroxide. These phenotypes were reversed by the addition of exogenous nitrite. Further investigation suggested that nitrite might inhibit the bacterial catalase. To the extent that Mtb itself is the most relevant source of nitrite acting within Mtb, these findings suggest that inhibitors of Mtb's nitrate transporter or nitrate reductase could enhance the efficacy of isoniazid.

We studied pronounced temporal morphological changes of Arthrospira in Kenyan soda lakes, Nakuru and Bogoria, and identified underlying key factors. Cell (diameter and height) and filament (height of coil, coil diameter, and number) dimensions were measured from weekly samples collected over a period of 16 months. In both lakes, medium-sized cells and large, widely coiled filaments prevailed most. Percentage of large, widely coiled filaments was promoted by elevated levels of soluble reactive phosphorus, wind speed, temperature and conductivity and the opposite for small filaments. Large, narrow-coiled filaments were associated with an increase in mainly Arthrospira-grazing zooplankton and cyanophage infections. Widely coiled spirals were promoted by increased turbulences. Based on fluorescence measurements, we found widely coiled filaments representing high vitality. From this study we were able to demonstrate for the first time morphological patterns of Arthrospira in nature. Arthrospira morphotypes are suitable for indicating the biological status in soda lakes as they are subjective and therefore reflective of what is happening in its habitat. Additionally, this outcome might be also of interest for commercial 'Spirulina' farms in enhancing high-quality production.","1041":"Agrobacterium-mediated transformation is a useful tool for the genetic modification in plants, although its efficiency is low for several plant species. Agrobacterium-mediated transformation has three major steps in laboratory-controlled experiments: the delivery of T-DNA into plant cells, the selection of transformed plant cells, and the regeneration of whole plants from the selected cells. Each of these steps must be optimized to improve the efficiency of Agrobacterium-mediated plant transformation. It has been reported that increasing the number of cells transformed by T-DNA delivery can improve the frequency of stable transformation. Previously, we demonstrated that a reduction in ethylene production by plant cells during cocultivation with A. tumefaciens-expressing 1-aminocyclopropane-1-carboxylic acid (ACC) deaminase resulted in increased T-DNA delivery into the plant cells. In this study, to further improve T-DNA delivery by A. tumefaciens, we modified the expression cassette of the ACC deaminase gene using vir gene promoter sequences. The ACC deaminase gene driven by the virD1 promoter was expressed at a higher level, resulting in a higher ACC deaminase activity in this A. tumefaciens strain than in the strain with the lac promoter used in a previous study. The newly developed A. tumefaciens strain improves the delivery of T-DNA into Solanum lycopersicum (tomato) and Erianthus ravennae plants and thus may be a powerful tool for the Agrobacterium-mediated genetic engineering of plants.","1042":"We studied the impact of a sublethal concentration of erythromycin on the fitness and proteome of a continuously cultivated population of Escherichia coli. The development of resistance to erythromycin in the population was followed over time by the gradient plate method and minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) measurements. We measured the growth rate, standardized efficiency of synthesis of radiolabeled proteins, and translation accuracy of the system. The proteome changes were followed over time in two parallel experiments that differed in the presence or absence of erythromycin. A comparison of the proteomes at each time point (43, 68, and 103 h) revealed a group of unique proteins differing in expression. From all 35 proteins differing throughout the cultivation, only three were common to more than one time point. In the final population, a significant proportion of upregulated proteins was localized to the outer or inner cytoplasmic membranes or to the periplasmic space. In a population growing for more than 100 generations in the presence of antibiotic, erythromycin-resistant bacterial clones with improved fitness in comparison to early resistant culture predominated. This phenomenon was accompanied by distinct changes in protein expression during a stepwise, population-based development of erythromycin resistance.","1043":"The deeply branching Deinococcus-Thermus lineage is recognized as one of the most extremophilic phylum of bacteria. In previous studies, the presence of Deinococcus-related bacteria in the hot arid Tunisian desert of Tataouine was demonstrated through combined molecular and culture-based approaches. Similarly, Thermus-related bacteria have been detected in Tunisian geothermal springs. The present work was conducted to explore the molecular diversity within the Deinococcus-Thermus phylum in these extreme environments. A set of specific primers was designed in silico on the basis of 16S rRNA gene sequences, validated for the specific detection of reference strains, and used for the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification of metagenomic DNA retrieved from the Tataouine desert sand and Tunisian hot spring water samples. These analyses have revealed the presence of previously undescribed Deinococcus-Thermus bacterial sequences within these extreme environments. The primers designed in this study thus represent a powerful tool for the rapid detection of Deinococcus-Thermus in environmental samples and could also be applicable to clarify the biogeography of the Deinococcus-Thermus phylum.","1044":"The significance of antimicrobial substances, halocins, produced by halophilic archaea and bacteria thriving in hypersaline environments is relatively unknown. It is suggested that their production might increase species diversity and give transient competitive advances to the producer strain. Halocin production is considered to be common among halophilic archaea, but there is a lack of information about halocins produced by bacteria in highly saline environments. We studied the antimicrobial activity of 68 halophilic archaea and 22 bacteria isolated from numerous geographically distant hypersaline environments. Altogether 144 antimicrobial interactions were found between the strains and aside haloarchaea, halophilic bacteria from various genera were identified as halocin producers. Close to 80% of the interactions were detected between microorganisms from different genera and in few cases, even across the domain boundary. Several of the strains produced halocins with a wide inhibitory spectrum as has been observed before. Most of the antimicrobial interactions were found between strains from distant sampling sites indicating that hypersaline environments around the world have similar microorganisms with the potential to produce wide activity range antimicrobials.","1045":"RodZ is important for maintaining the rod shape of Escherichia coli. Loss of RodZ causes conversion of the rod shape to a round shape and a growth rate slower than that of wild-type cells. Suppressor mutations that simultaneously restore both the growth rates and the rod shape were isolated. Most of the suppressor mutations are found in mreB, mrdA, or mrdB. One of the mutations was in the promoter region of zipA, which encodes a crucial component of the cell division machinery. In this study, we investigated the mechanism of the suppression by this mutation. ZipA was slightly but significantly increased in the suppressor cells and led to a delay in cell division. While round-shaped mreB and mrdA mutants lose cell bipolarity, we found that round-shaped rodZ mutants retained cell bipolarity. Therefore, we concluded that a delay in the completion of septation provides extra time to elongate the cell laterally so that the zipA suppressor mutant is able to recover its ovoid or rod shape. The suppression by zipA demonstrates that the regulation of timing of septation potentially contributes to the conversion of morphology in bacterial cells.","1046":"When denitrifying bacteria such as Paracoccus denitrificans respire anaerobically they convert nitrate to dinitrogen gas via a pathway which includes the potent greenhouse gas, nitrous oxide (N2 O). The copper-dependent enzyme Nitrous Oxide reductase (Nos) catalyzes the reduction of N2 O to dinitrogen. In low-copper conditions, recent experiments in chemostats have demonstrated that Nos efficiency decreases resulting in significant N2 O emissions. For the first time, a chemostat-based mathematical model is developed that describes the anaerobic denitrification pathway based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics and published kinetic parameters. The model predicts steady-state enzyme levels from experimental data. For low copper concentrations, the predicted Nos level is significantly reduced, whereas the levels for the non copper-dependent reductases in the pathway remain relatively unaffected. The model provides time courses for the pathway metabolites that accurately reflect previously published experimental data. In the absence of experimental data purely predictive analyses can also be readily performed by calculating the relative Nos level directly from the copper concentration. Here, the model quantitatively estimates the increasing level of emitted N2 O as the copper level decreases.","1047":null,"1048":null,"1049":null,"1050":null,"1051":null,"1052":"Lack of molybdenum cofactor (Moco) in Escherichia coli leads to hypersensitivity to the mutagenic and toxic effects of N-hydroxylated base analogs, such as 6-N-hydroxylaminopurine (HAP). This phenotype is due to the loss of two Moco-dependent activities, YcbX and YiiM, that are capable of reducing HAP to adenine. Here, we describe two novel HAP-sensitive mutants containing a defect in iscS or tusA (yhhP) gene. IscS is a major L-cysteine desulfurase involved in iron-sulfur cluster synthesis, thiamine synthesis, and tRNA thiomodification. TusA is a small sulfur-carrier protein that interacts with IscS. We show that both IscS and TusA operate within the Moco-dependent pathway. Like other Moco-deficient strains, tusA and iscS mutants are HAP sensitive and resistant to chlorate under anaerobic conditions. The base-analog sensitivity of iscS or tusA strains could be suppressed by supplying exogenous L-cysteine or sulfide or by an increase in endogenous sulfur donors (cysB constitutive mutant). The data suggest that iscS and tusA mutants have a defect in the mobilization of sulfur required for active YcbX\/YiiM proteins as well as nitrate reductase, presumably due to lack of functional Moco. Overall, our data imply a novel and indispensable role of the IscS\/TusA complex in the activity of several molybdoenzymes.","1053":null,"1054":"Spx of Bacillus subtilis is a redox-sensitive protein, which, under disulfide stress, interacts with RNA polymerase to activate genes required for maintaining thiol homeostasis. Spx orthologs are highly conserved among low %GC Gram-positive bacteria, and often exist in multiple paralogous forms. In this study, we used B. anthracis Sterne, which harbors two paralogous spx genes, spxA1 and spxA2, to examine the phenotypes of spx null mutations and to identify the genes regulated by each Spx paralog. Cells devoid of spxA1 were sensitive to diamide and hydrogen peroxide, while the spxA1 spoxA2 double mutant was hypersensitive to the thiol-specific oxidant, diamide. Bacillus anthracis Sterne strains expressing spxA1DD or spxA2DD alleles encoding protease-resistant products were used in microarray and quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) analyses in order to uncover genes under SpxA1, SpxA2, or SpxA1\/SpxA2 control. Comparison of transcriptomes identified many genes that were upregulated when either SpxA1DD or SpxA2DD was produced, but several genes were uncovered whose transcript levels increased in only one of the two SpxADD-expression strains, suggesting that each Spx paralog governs a unique regulon. Among genes that were upregulated were those encoding orthologs of proteins that are specifically involved in maintaining intracellular thiol homeostasis or alleviating oxidative stress. Some of these genes have important roles in B. anthracis pathogenesis, and a large number of upregulated hypothetical genes have no homology outside of the B. cereus\/thuringiensis group. Microarray and RT-qPCR analyses also unveiled a regulatory link that exists between the two spx paralogous genes. The data indicate that spxA1 and spxA2 are transcriptional regulators involved in relieving disulfide stress but also control a set of genes whose products function in other cellular processes.","1055":"A novel enzyme with lysine-epsilon oxidase activity was previously described in the marine bacterium Marinomonas mediterranea.

The first one codes for the oxidase, while the second one encodes a protein required for the expression of the former. Genome sequencing of M. mediterranea has revealed that it contains two additional operons encoding proteins with sequence similarity to LodA. In this study, it is shown that the product of one of such genes, Marme_1655, encodes a protein with glycine oxidase activity. This activity shows important differences in terms of substrate range and sensitivity to inhibitors to other glycine oxidases previously described which are flavoproteins synthesized by Bacillus. The results presented in this study indicate that the products of the genes with different degrees of similarity to lodA detected in bacterial genomes could constitute a reservoir of different oxidases.

A total of 716 starling and 720 duck fecal samples were collected and screened for C. jejuni over a 12 month period. This study combined molecular genotyping, population genetics and epidemiological modeling and revealed: (i) higher Campylobacter spp. isolation in starlings (46%) compared with ducks (30%), but similar isolation of C. jejuni in ducks (23%) and starlings (21%), (ii) significant associations between the isolation of Campylobacter spp. and host species, sampling location and time of year using logistic regression, (iii) evidence of population differentiation, as indicated by FST , and host-genotype association with clonal complexes CC ST-177 and CC ST-682 associated with starlings, and clonal complexes CC ST-1034, CC ST-692, and CC ST-1332 associated with ducks, and (iv) greater genetic diversity and genotype richness in ducks compared with starlings. These findings provide evidence that host-associated genotypes, such as the starling-associated ST-177 and ST-682, represent lineages that were introduced with the host species in the 19th century. The isolation of sequence types associated with human disease in New Zealand indicate that wild ducks and starlings need to be considered as a potential public health risk, particularly in urban areas.","1058":"Floral nectar of animal-pollinated plants is commonly infested with microorganisms, yet little is known about the microorganisms inhabiting the floral nectar of orchids. In this study, we investigated microbial communities occurring in the floral nectar of seven Epipactis (Orchidaceae) species. Culturable bacteria and yeasts were isolated and identified by partially sequencing the small subunit (SSU) ribosomal RNA (rRNA) gene and the D1\/D2 domains of the large subunit (LSU) rRNA gene, respectively. Using three different culture media, we found that bacteria were common inhabitants of the floral nectar of Epipactis. The most widely distributed bacterial operational taxonomic units (OTUs) in nectar of Epipactis were representatives of the family of Enterobacteriaceae, with an unspecified Enterobacteriaceae bacterium as the most common. In contrast to previous studies investigating microbial communities in floral nectar, very few yeast species (mainly of the genus Cryptococcus) were observed, and most of them occurred in very low densities. Total OTU richness (i.e., the number of bacterial and yeast OTUs per orchid species) varied between 4 and 20. Cluster analysis revealed that microbial communities of allogamous species differed from those of autogamous and facultatively autogamous species. This study extends previous efforts to identify microbial communities in floral nectar and indicates that the floral nectar of the orchids investigated mainly contained bacterial communities with moderate phylogenetic diversity. ","1059":null,"1060":"Mutations involving the Tol-Pal complex of Escherichia coli result in a subtle phenotype in which cells chain when grown under low-salt conditions. Here, the nonpolar deletion of individual genes encoding the cytoplasmic membrane-associated components of the complex (TolQ, TolR, TolA) produced a similar phenotype. Surprisingly, the overexpression of one of these proteins, TolQ, resulted in a much more overt phenotype in which cells occurred as elongated rods coupled in long chains when grown under normal salt conditions. Neither TolR nor TolA overexpression produced a phenotype, nor was the presence of either protein required for the TolQ-dependent phenotype. Consistent with their native membrane topology, the amino-terminal domain of TolQ specifically associated in vivo with the periplasmic domain of FtsN in a cytoplasm-based two-hybrid analysis. Further, the concomitant overexpression of FtsN rescued the TolQ-dependent phenotype, suggesting a model wherein the overexpression of TolQ sequesters FtsN, depleting this essential protein from the divisome during Gram-negative cell division. The role of the Tol-Pal system in division is discussed. ","1061":"The aim of this study was to clarify the phagocytic mechanisms of a heat-killed cell preparation of Enterococcus faecalis strain EC-12 (EC-12) by antigen-presenting cells (APCs). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled EC-12 was cocultured with peritoneal macrophage and the amount of EC-12 phagocytosed by peritoneal macrophages was measured using a microplate fluorometer. Peritoneal macrophages from toll-like receptor (TLR)2-, TLR7-, and MyD88-deficient knockout (KO) mice exhibited similar levels of EC-12 phagocytosis to those from wild-type mice. Similarly, dectin-1 neutralization of peritoneal macrophages had no effect on EC-12 phagocytosis. However, blockade of the mannose receptor (MR) significantly decreased the amount of EC-12 phagocytosed by peritoneal macrophages; the same effect was observed in bone marrow-derived macrophages and dendritic cells. Our findings suggest that MR plays a major role in EC-12 phagocytosis by the APCs. ","1062":"Cellulose is recalcitrant to deconstruction to glucose for use in fermentation strategies for biofuels and chemicals derived from lignocellulose. In Neurospora crassa, the transcriptional regulator, CLR-2, is required for cellulolytic gene expression and cellulose deconstruction. To assess conservation and divergence of cellulase gene regulation between fungi from different ecological niches, we compared clr-2 function with its ortholog (clrB) in the distantly related species, Aspergillus nidulans. Transcriptional profiles induced by exposure to crystalline cellulose were similar in both species. Approximately 50% of the cellulose-responsive genes showed strict dependence on functional clr-2\/clrB, with a subset of 28 genes encoding plant biomass degrading enzymes that were conserved between N. crassa and A. nidulans. Importantly, misexpression of clr-2 under noninducing conditions was sufficient to drive cellulase gene expression, secretion, and activity in N. crassa, to a level comparable to wild type exposed to Avicel. However, misexpression of clrB in A. nidulans was not sufficient to drive cellulase gene expression under noninducing conditions, although an increase in cellulase activity was observed under crystalline cellulose conditions. Manipulation of clr-2 orthologs among filamentous fungi may enable regulated cellulosic enzyme production in a wide array of culture conditions and host strains, potentially reducing costs associated with enzyme production for plant cell wall deconstruction. However, this functionality may require additional engineering in some species.

We have described and compared the richness, the distribution of Operational Taxonomic Units (OTUs) within the two fractions, the spatial distribution, and the taxonomic composition of FL and PA bacterial assemblages. The number of OTUs in the present work was two orders of magnitude higher than in previous studies. Only 25% of the total OTUs were common to both fractions, whereas 49% OTUs were exclusive to the PA fraction and 26% to the FL fraction. The OTUs exclusively present in PA or FL assemblages were very low in abundance (6% of total abundance). Detection of the rare OTUs revealed the larger richness of PA bacteria that was hidden in previous studies. Alpha-Proteobacteria dominated the FL bacterial assemblage and gamma-Proteobacteria dominated the PA fraction. Bacteroidetes were important in the PA fraction mainly at the coast. The high number of sequences in this study detected additional phyla from the PA fraction, such as Actinobacteria, Firmicutes, and Verrucomicrobia. ","1066":"Ubiquitination is a highly dynamic and versatile posttranslational modification that regulates protein function, stability, and interactions. To investigate the roles of ubiquitination in a primitive eukaryotic lineage, we utilized the early-branching eukaryote Giardia intestinalis. Using a combination of biochemical, immunofluorescence-based, and proteomics approaches, we assessed the ubiquitination status during the process of differentiation in Giardia. We observed that different types of ubiquitin modifications present specific cellular and temporal distribution throughout the Giardia life cycle from trophozoites to cyst maturation. Ubiquitin signal was detected in the wall of mature cysts, and enzymes implicated in cyst wall biogenesis were identified as substrates for ubiquitination. Interestingly, inhibition of proteasome activity did not affect trophozoite replication and differentiation, while it caused a decrease in cyst viability, arguing for proteasome involvement in cyst wall maturation. Using a proteomics approach, we identified around 200 high-confidence ubiquitinated candidates that vary their ubiquitination status during differentiation. Our results indicate that ubiquitination is critical for several cellular processes in this primitive eukaryote.","1067":"The GacS\/GacA two-component regulatory system activates the production of secondary metabolites including phenazines crucial for biological control activity in Pseudomonas chlororaphis 30-84. To better understand the role of the Gac system on phenazine regulation, transcriptomic analyses were conducted by comparing the wild-type strain to a gacA mutant. RNA-seq analysis identified 771 genes under GacA control, including many novel genes. Consistent with previous findings, phenazine biosynthetic genes were significantly downregulated in a gacA mutant. The transcript abundances of phenazine regulatory genes such as phzI, phzR, iopA, iopB, rpoS, and pip also were reduced. Moreover, the transcript abundance of three noncoding RNAs (ncRNAs) including rsmX, rsmY, and rsmZ was significantly decreased by gacA mutation consistent with the presence of consensus GacA-binding sites associated with their promoters. Our results also demonstrated that constitutive expression of rsmZ from a non-gac regulated promoter resulted in complete restoration of N-acyl-homoserine lactone (AHL) and phenazine production as well as the expression of other gac-dependent secondary metabolites in gac mutants. The role of RsmA and RsmE in phenazine production also was investigated. Overexpression of rsmE, but not rsmA, resulted in decreased AHL and phenazine production in P. chlororaphis, and only a mutation in rsmE bypassed the requirement for GacA in phenazine gene expression. In contrast, constitutive expression of the phzI\/phzR quorum sensing system did not rescue phenazine production in the gacA mutant, indicating the direct posttranscriptional control by Gac on the phenazine biosynthetic genes. On the basis of these results, we propose a model to illustrate the hierarchic role of phenazine regulators modulated by Gac in the control of phenazine production. The transcriptomic analysis also was used to identify additional genes regulated by GacA that may contribute to the biological control capability of strain 30-84.","1068":null,"1069":null,"1070":"A unique operon structure has been identified in the genomes of several plant- and insect-associated bacteria. The distinguishing feature of this operon is the presence of tandem hilA and hilB genes encoding dioxygenases belonging to the PF13640 and PF10014 (BsmA) Pfam families, respectively. The genes encoding HilA and HilB from Pantoea ananatis AJ13355 were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli. The culturing of E. coli cells expressing hilA (E. coli-HilA) or both hilA and hilB (E. coli-HilAB) in the presence of l-isoleucine resulted in the conversion of l-isoleucine into two novel biogenic compounds: l-4'-isoleucine and l-4,4'-dihydroxyisoleucine, respectively. In parallel, two novel enzymatic activities were detected in the crude cell lysates of the E. coli-HilA and E. coli-HilAB strains: l-isoleucine, 2-oxoglutarate: oxygen oxidoreductase (4'-hydroxylating) (HilA) and l-4'-hydroxyisoleucine, 2-oxoglutarate: oxygen oxidoreductase (4-hydroxylating) (HilB), respectively. Two hypotheses regarding the physiological significance of C-4(4')-hydroxylation of l-isoleucine in bacteria are also discussed. According to first hypothesis, the l-isoleucine dihydroxylation cascade is involved in synthesis of dipeptide antibiotic in P. ananatis. Another unifying hypothesis is that the C-4(4')-hydroxylation of l-isoleucine in bacteria could result in the synthesis of signal molecules belonging to two classes: 2(5H)-furanones and analogs of N-acyl homoserine lactone.","1071":null,"1072":null,"1073":"Photosynthetic bacteria can switch from planktonic lifestyle to phototrophic biofilm in mats in response to environmental changes. The mechanisms of phototrophic biofilm formation are, however, not characterized. Herein, we report a two-component system EmbRS that controls the biofilm formation in a photosynthetic member of the Burkholderiales order, the purple bacterium Rubrivivax gelatinosus. EmbRS inactivation results in cells that form conspicuous bacterial veils and fast-sinking aggregates in liquid. Biofilm analyses indicated that EmbRS represses the production of an extracellular matrix and biofilm formation. Mapping of transposon mutants that partially or completely restore the wild-type (WT) phenotype allowed the identification of two gene clusters involved in polysaccharide synthesis, one fully conserved only in Thauera sp., a floc-forming wastewater bacterium. A second two-component system BmfRS and a putative diguanylate cyclase BdcA were also identified in this screen suggesting their involvement in biofilm formation in this bacterium. The role of polysaccharides in sinking of microorganisms and organic matter, as well as the importance and the evolution of such regulatory system in phototrophic microorganisms are discussed.","1074":null,"1075":"Prions are epigenetic modifiers that cause partially loss-of-function phenotypes of the proteins in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The molecular chaperone network that supports prion propagation in the cell has seen a great progress in the last decade. However, the cellular machinery to activate or deactivate the prion states remains an enigma, largely due to insufficient knowledge of prion-regulating factors. Here, we report that overexpression of a [PSI(+) ]-inducible Q\/N-rich protein, Lsm4, eliminates the three major prions [PSI(+) ], [URE3], and [RNQ(+) ]. Subcloning analysis revealed that the Q\/N-rich region of Lsm4 is responsible for the prion loss. Lsm4 formed an amyloid in vivo, which seemed to play a crucial role in the prion elimination. Fluorescence correlation spectroscopy analysis revealed that in the course of the Lsm4-driven [PSI(+) ] elimination, the [PSI(+) ] aggregates undergo a size increase, which ultimately results in the formation of conspicuous foci in otherwise [psi(-) ]-like mother cells. We also found that the antiprion activity is a general property of [PSI(+) ]-inducible factors. These data provoked a novel \"unified\" model that explains both prion induction and elimination by a single scheme.","1076":"The periodontal pathogen Porphyromonas gingivalis has two different lipopolysaccharides (LPSs) designated O-LPS and A-LPS, which are a conventional O-antigen polysaccharide and an anionic polysaccharide that are both linked to lipid A-cores, respectively. However, the precise mechanisms of LPS biosynthesis remain to be determined. In this study, we isolated a pigment-less mutant by transposon mutagenesis and identified that the transposon was inserted into the coding sequence PGN_2005, which encodes a hypothetical protein of P. gingivalis ATCC 33277. We found that (i) LPSs purified from the PGN_2005 mutant were shorter than those of the wild type; (ii) the PGN_2005 protein was located in the inner membrane fraction; and (iii) the PGN_2005 gene conferred Wzz activity upon an Escherichia coli wzz mutant. These results indicate that the PGN_2005 protein, which was designated WzzP, is a functional homolog of the Wzz protein in P. gingivalis. Comparison of amino acid sequences among WzzP and conventional Wzz proteins indicated that WzzP had an additional fragment at the C-terminal region. In addition, we determined that the PGN_1896 and PGN_1233 proteins and the PGN_1033 protein appear to be WbaP homolog proteins and a Wzx homolog protein involved in LPS biosynthesis, respectively.","1077":null,"1078":null,"1079":"The formation of a Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilm, a complex structure enclosing bacterial cells in an extracellular polymeric matrix, is responsible for persistent infections in cystic fibrosis patients leading to a high rate of morbidity and mortality. The protective environment created by the tridimensional structure reduces the susceptibility of the bacteria to conventional antibiotherapy. Cationic steroid antibiotics (CSA)-13, a nonpeptide mimic of antimicrobial peptides with antibacterial activity on planktonic cultures, was evaluated for its ability to interact with sessile cells. Using confocal laser scanning microscopy, we demonstrated that the drug damaged bacteria within an established biofilm showing that penetration did not limit the activity of this antimicrobial agent against a biofilm. When biofilms were grown during exposure to shear forces and to a continuous medium flow allowing the development of robust structures with a complex architecture, CSA-13 reached the bacteria entrapped in the biofilm within 30 min. The permeabilizing effect of CSA-13 could be associated with the death of the bacteria. In static conditions, the compound did not perturb the architecture of the biofilm. This study confirms the potential of CSA-13 as a new strategy to combat persistent infections involving biofilms formed by P. aeruginosa.","1080":"The complete mitochondrial genome of Rhodotorula taiwanensis RS1, an aluminum-tolerant Basidiomycota fungus, was determined and compared with the known mitochondrial genomes of 12 Basidiomycota species. The mitochondrial genome of R. taiwanensis RS1 is a circular DNA molecule of 40,392 bp and encodes the typical 15 mitochondrial proteins, 23 tRNAs, and small and large rRNAs as well as 10 intronic open reading frames. These genes are apparently transcribed in two directions and do not show syntenies in gene order with other investigated Basidiomycota species. The average G+C content (41%) of the mitochondrial genome of R. taiwanensis RS1 is the highest among the Basidiomycota species. Two introns were detected in the sequence of the atp9 gene of R. taiwanensis RS1, but not in that of other Basidiomycota species. Rhodotorula taiwanensis is the first species of the genus Rhodotorula whose full mitochondrial genome has been sequenced; and the data presented here supply valuable information for understanding the evolution of fungal mitochondrial genomes and researching the mechanism of aluminum tolerance in microorganisms.","1081":"Protein Y (PY) is an Escherichia coli cold-shock protein which has been proposed to be responsible for the repression of bulk protein synthesis during cold adaptation. Here, we present in vivo and in vitro data which clarify the role of PY and its mechanism of action. Deletion of yfiA, the gene encoding protein PY, demonstrates that this protein is dispensable for cold adaptation and is not responsible for the shutdown of bulk protein synthesis at the onset of the stress, although it is able to partially inhibit translation. In vitro assays reveal that the extent of PY inhibition changes with different mRNAs and that this inhibition is related to the capacity of PY of binding 30S subunits with a fairly strong association constant, thus stimulating the formation of 70S monomers. Furthermore, our data provide evidence that PY competes with the other ribosomal ligands for the binding to the 30S subunits. Overall these results suggest an alternative model to explain PY function during cold shock and to reconcile the inhibition caused by PY with the active translation observed for some mRNAs during cold shock.","1082":null,"1083":null,"1084":null,"1085":"We systematically studied free-living bacterial diversity within aggregations of the vestimentiferan tubeworm Ridgeia piscesae sampled from two contrasting flow regimes (High Flow and Low Flow) in the Endeavour Hydrothermal Vents Marine Protected Area (MPA) on the Juan de Fuca Ridge (Northeast Pacific). Eight samples of particulate detritus were recovered from paired tubeworm grabs from four vent sites. Most sequences (454 tag and Sanger methods) were affiliated to the Epsilonproteobacteria, and the sulfur-oxidizing genus Sulfurovum was dominant in all samples. Gammaproteobacteria were also detected, mainly in Low Flow sequence libraries, and were affiliated with known methanotrophs and decomposers. The cooccurrence of sulfur reducers from the Deltaproteobacteria and the Epsilonproteobacteria suggests internal sulfur cycling within these habitats. Other phyla detected included Bacteroidetes, Actinobacteria, Chloroflexi, Firmicutes, Planctomycetes, Verrucomicrobia, and Deinococcus-Thermus. Statistically significant relationships between sequence library composition and habitat type suggest a predictable pattern for High Flow and Low Flow environments. Most sequences significantly more represented in High Flow libraries were related to sulfur and hydrogen oxidizers, while mainly heterotrophic groups were more represented in Low Flow libraries. Differences in temperature, available energy for metabolism, and stability between High Flow and Low Flow habitats potentially explain their distinct bacterial communities.","1086":"Identification of essential genes by construction of conditional knockouts with inducible promoters allows the identification of essential genes and creation of conditional growth (CG) mutants that are then available as genetic tools for further studies. We used large-scale transposon delivery of the rhamnose-inducible promoter, PrhaB followed by robotic screening of rhamnose-dependent growth to construct a genomic library of 106 Burkholderia cenocepacia CG mutants. Transposon insertions were found where PrhaB was in the same orientation of widely conserved, well-characterized essential genes as well as genes with no previous records of essentiality in other microorganisms. Using previously reported global gene-expression analyses, we demonstrate that PrhaB can achieve the wide dynamic range of expression levels required for essential genes when the promoter is delivered randomly and mutants with rhamnose-dependent growth are selected. We also show specific detection of the target of an antibiotic, novobiocin, by enhanced sensitivity of the corresponding CG mutant (PrhaB controlling gyrB expression) within the library. Modulation of gene expression to achieve 30-60% of wild-type growth created conditions for specific hypersensitivity demonstrating the value of the CG mutant library for chemogenomic experiments. In summary, CG mutants can be obtained on a large scale by random delivery of a tightly regulated inducible promoter into the bacterial chromosome followed by a simple screening for the CG phenotype, without previous information on gene essentiality.","1087":"The Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) comprises strains with a virulence potential toward immunocompromised patients as well as plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR). Owing to the link between quorum sensing (QS) and virulence, most studies among Bcc species have been directed toward QS of pathogenic bacteria. We have investigated the QS of B. ambifaria, a PGPR only infrequently recovered from patients. The cepI gene, responsible for the synthesis of the main signaling molecule N-octanoylhomoserine lactone (C8 -HSL), was inactivated. Phenotypes of the B. ambifaria cepI mutant we observed, such as increased production of siderophores and decreased proteolytic and antifungal activities, are in agreement with those of other Bcc cepI mutants. The cepI mutant was then used as background strain for a whole-genome transposon-insertion mutagenesis strategy, allowing the identification of 20 QS-controlled genes, corresponding to 17 loci. The main functions identified are linked to antifungal and antimicrobial properties, as we have identified QS-controlled genes implicated in the production of pyrrolnitrin, burkholdines (occidiofungin-like molecules), and enacyloxins. This study provides insights in the QS-regulated functions of a PGPR, which could lead to beneficial potential biotechnological applications.","1088":"Bacteria of the genus Arthrobacter are common inhabitants of the soil environment, but can also be recovered from leaf surfaces (the phyllosphere). Using enrichment cultures on 4-chlorophenol, we succeeded in specifically isolating Arthrobacter bacteria from ground cover vegetation in an apple orchard. Based on 16S rRNA gene sequencing, the isolates were found to belong to at least three different species of Arthrobacter. Compared to the model bacterial epiphyte Pantoea agglomerans, the Arthrobacter isolates performed as well or even better in a standardized laboratory test of phyllosphere fitness. A similar performance was observed with the well-characterized soil isolate Arthrobacter chlorophenolicus A6. These findings suggest that the frequently reported presence of Arthrobacter strains on plant foliage can be explained by the capacity to multiply and persist in the phyllosphere environment. As bacteria from the genus Arthrobacter are known for their ability to degrade a wide variety of organic pollutants, their high phyllosphere competency marks them as a promising group for future studies on phyllosphere-based bioremediation, for example, as foliar bioaugmentation on ground cover or buffer-zone vegetation to prevent pesticides from reaching soil, surface-, or groundwater.","1089":"Despite the enormous amount of data available on the importance of the gastrointestinal (GI) microbiota in vertebrate (especially mammals), information on the GI microbiota of seabirds remains incomplete. As with many seabirds, penguins have a unique digestive physiology that enables them to store large reserves of adipose tissue, protein, and lipids. This study used quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) and 16S rRNA gene pyrosequencing to characterize the interspecific variations of the GI microbiota of four penguin species: the king, gentoo, macaroni, and little penguin. The qPCR results indicated that there were significant differences in the abundance of the major phyla Firmicutes, Bacteroides, Actinobacteria, and Proteobacteria. A total of 132,340, 18,336, 6324, and 4826 near full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences were amplified from fecal samples collected from king, gentoo, macaroni, and little penguins, respectively. A total of 13 phyla were identified with Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes, Proteobacteria, and Fusobacteria dominating the composition; however, there were major differences in the relative abundance of the phyla. In addition, this study documented the presence of known human pathogens, such as Campylobacter, Helicobacter, Prevotella, Veillonella, Erysipelotrichaceae, Neisseria, and Mycoplasma. However, their role in disease in penguins remains unknown. To our knowledge, this is the first study to provide an in-depth investigation of the GI microbiota of penguins.","1090":"The composition of the microbiota associated with the human ileum and colon in the early weeks of life of two preterm infants was examined, with particular emphasis on the Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium members. Culturing work showed that bifidobacteria and lactobacilli in the ileostomy changed over time, compared with the colostomy effluent where there was far less variation. The colostomy infant was dominated by two phyla, Actinobacteria and Firmicutes, while in the ileostomy samples, Proteobacteria emerged at the expense of Actinobacteria. Bacteroidetes were only detected following the reversal of the ileostomy in the final fecal sample and were not detected in any colonic fluid samples. Clostridia levels were unstable in the colostomy fluid, suggesting that the ileostomy\/colostomy itself influenced the gut microbiota, in particular the strict anaerobes. Pyrosequencing analysis of microbiota composition indicated that bifidobacteria and lactobacilli are among the dominant genera in both the ileal and colonic fluids. Bifidobacteria and lactobacilli levels were unstable in the ileostomy fluid, with large reductions in numbers and relative proportions of both observed. These decreases were characterized by an increase in proportions of Streptococcus and Enterobacteriaceae. Clostridium was detected only in the colonic effluent, with large changes in the relative proportions over time.","1091":null,"1092":null,"1093":null,"1094":null,"1095":"Discrimination among viable\/active or dead\/inactive cells in a microbial community is a vital question to address issues on ecological microbiology or microbiological quality control. It is commonly assumed that metabolically active cells (ChemchromeV6 [CV6] procedure) correspond to viable cells (direct viable count procedure [DVC]), although this assumption has never been demonstrated and is therefore a matter of debate. Indeed, simultaneous determination of cell viability and metabolic activity has never been performed on the same cells. Here, we developed a microfluidic device to investigate the viability and the metabolic activity of Escherichia coli cells at single-cell level. Cells were immobilized in a flow chamber in which different solutions were sequentially injected according to different scenarios. By using time-lapse microscopy combined with automated tracking procedures, we first successfully assessed the ability of cells to divide and their metabolic activity at single-cell level. Applying these two procedures on the same cells after a hypochlorous acid (HOCl) treatment, we showed that the ability of cells to divide and their metabolic activity were anticorrelated. These results indicate that the relation between CV6 uptake and cell viability may be partially incorrect. Care must be taken in using the terms \"CV6-positive\" and \"viable\" synonymously.","1096":null,"1097":"Coastal marine hypoxic, or low-oxygen, episodes are an increasing worldwide phenomenon, but its effect on the microbial community is virtually unknown by far. In this study, the community structure and phylogeny of picoeukaryotes in the Gulf of Mexico, which are exposed to severe hypoxia in these areas was explored through a clone library approach. Both oxic surface waters and suboxic bottom waters were collected in August 2010 from three representative stations on the inner Louisiana shelf near the Atchafalaya and Mississippi River plumes. The bottom waters of the two more western stations were much more hypoxic in comparison to those of the station closest to the Mississippi River plume, which were only moderately hypoxic. A phylogenetic analysis of a total 175 sequences, generated from six 18S rDNA clone libraries, demonstrated a clear dominance of parasitic dinoflagellates from Marine alveolate clades I and II in all hypoxic waters as well as in the surface layer at the more western station closest to the Atchafalaya River plume. Species diversity was significantly higher at the most hypoxic sites, and many novel species were present among the dinoflagellate and stramenopile clades. We concluded that hypoxia in the Gulf of Mexico causes a significant shift in picoeukaryote communities, and that hypoxia may cause a shift in microbial food webs from grazing to parasitism.","1098":"Sa-Lrp is a member of the leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp)-like family of transcriptional regulators in Sulfolobus acidocaldarius. Previously, we demonstrated the binding of Sa-Lrp to the control region of its own gene in vitro. However, the function and cofactor of Sa-Lrp remained an enigma. In this work, we demonstrate that glutamine is the cofactor of Sa-Lrp by inducing the formation of octamers and increasing the DNA-binding affinity and sequence specificity. In vitro protein-DNA interaction assays indicate that Sa-Lrp binds to promoter regions of genes with a variety of functions including ammonia assimilation, transcriptional control, and UV-induced pili synthesis. DNA binding occurs with a specific affinity for AT-rich binding sites, and the protein induces DNA bending and wrapping upon binding, indicating an architectural role of the regulator. Furthermore, by analyzing an Sa-lrp deletion mutant, we demonstrate that the protein affects transcription of some of the genes of which the promoter region is targeted and that it is an important determinant of the cellular aggregation phenotype. Taking all these results into account, we conclude that Sa-Lrp is a glutamine-responsive global transcriptional regulator with an additional architectural role.","1099":null,"1100":"High salt concentrations, absence of light, anoxia, and high hydrostatic pressure make deep hypersaline anoxic basins (DHABs) in the Eastern Mediterranean Sea one of the most polyextreme habitats on Earth. Taking advantage of the unique chemical characteristics of these basins, we tested the effect of environmental selection and geographic distance on the structure of protistan communities. Terminal restriction fragment length polymorphism (T-RFLP) analyses were performed on water samples from the brines and seawater\/brine interfaces of five basins: Discovery, Urania, Thetis, Tyro, and Medee. Using statistical analyses, we calculated the partitioning of diversity among the ten individual terminal restriction fragment (T-RF) profiles, based on peak abundance and peak incidence. While a significant distance effect on spatial protistan patterns was not detected, hydrochemical gradients emerged as strong dispersal barriers that likely lead to environmental selection in the DHAB protistan plankton communities. We identified sodium, magnesium, sulfate, and oxygen playing in concerto as dominant environmental drivers for the structuring of protistan plankton communities in the Eastern Mediterranean DHABs.","1101":"Vibrio coralliilyticus is an important coral pathogen demonstrated to cause disease outbreaks worldwide. This study investigated the feasibility of applying bacteriophage therapy to treat the coral pathogen V. coralliilyticus. A specific bacteriophage for V. coralliilyticus strain P1 (LMG23696), referred to here as bacteriophage YC, was isolated from the seawater above corals at Nelly Bay, Magnetic Island, central Great Barrier Reef (GBR), the same location where the bacterium was first isolated. Bacteriophage YC was shown to be a lytic phage belonging to the Myoviridae family, with a rapid replication rate, high burst size, and high affinity to its host. By infecting its host bacterium, bacteriophage YC was able to prevent bacterial-induced photosystem inhibition in pure cultures of Symbiodinium, the photosymbiont partner of coral and a target for virulence factors produced by the bacterial pathogen. Phage therapy experiments using coral juveniles in microtiter plates as a model system revealed that bacteriophage YC was able to prevent V. coralliilyticus-induced photoinactivation and tissue lysis. These results demonstrate that bacteriophage YC has the potential to treat coral disease outbreaks caused by the bacterial pathogen V. coralliilyticus, making it a good candidate for phage therapy treatment of coral disease.","1102":"Syntrophic acetate-oxidizing bacteria have been identified as key organisms for efficient biogas production from protein-rich materials. They normally grow as lithotrophs or heterotrophs, producing acetate through the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway, but when growing in syntrophy with methanogens, they reportedly reverse this pathway and oxidize acetate to hydrogen and carbon dioxide. However, the biochemical and regulatory mechanisms behind the shift and the way in which the bacteria regain energy remain unknown. In a genome-walking approach, starting with degenerated primers, we identified those gene clusters in Syntrophaceticus schinkii, Clostridium ultunense, and Tepidanaerobacter acetatoxydans that comprise the formyltetrahydrofolate synthetase gene (fhs), encoding a key enzyme of the Wood-Ljungdahl pathway. We also discovered that the latter two harbor two fhs alleles. The fhs genes are phylogenetically separated and in the case of S. schinkii functionally linked to sulfate reducers. The T. acetatoxydans fhs1 cluster combines features of acetogens, sulfate reducers, and carbon monoxide oxidizers and is organized as a putative operon. The T. acetatoxydans fhs2 cluster encodes Wood-Ljungdahl pathway enzymes, which are also known to be involved in C1 carbon metabolism. Isolation of the enzymes illustrated that both formyltetrahydrofolate synthetases of T. acetatoxydans were functionally active.

An APV-negative mutant still suppressed the E. amylovora population and fire blight disease symptoms in apple blossom experiments under greenhouse conditions, but was inferior to the Pa48b wild-type indicating the influence of APV in the antagonism. In plant experiments with the soybean pathogen Pseudomonas syringae pv. glycinea both, Pa48b and the APV-negative mutant, successfully suppressed the pathogen. Our results demonstrate that the P. agglomerans strain Pa48b is an efficient biocontrol organism against plant pathogens, and we prove its ability for fast colonization of plant surfaces over a wide temperature range.","1105":"The FixJ\/LuxR family transcription factor CsgD is a master regulator of biofilm formation in Escherichia coli. Previously, we identified more than 10 transcription factors that participate in regulation of the csgD promoter. After genomic SELEX screening of regulation targets, an uncharacterized TetR-type transcription factor YbjK was found to be involved in regulation of the csgD promoter. In addition, a number of stress-response genes were found to be under the direct control of YbjK. Taken together, we propose to rename it to RcdA (regulator of csgD). One unique feature of RcdA is its mode of DNA binding. Gel shift, DNase-I footprinting, and atomic force microscopic (AFM) analyses indicated that RcdA is a DNA-binding protein with a high level of cooperativity, with which it covers the entire surface of probe DNA through protein-protein interaction and moreover it induces the formation of aggregates of DNA-RcdA complexes.","1106":null,"1107":"Enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) are involved in outbreaks of food-borne illness and transmitted to humans through bovine products or water contaminated by cattle feces. Microbial interaction is one of the strategies used by pathogenic bacteria to survive in the environment. Among protozoa, the free-living amoebae are known to host and protect several water-borne pathogens. In this study, the interaction between EHEC and the predacious protozoa Acanthamoeba castellanii was investigated. Using monoculture and cocultures, growth of both organisms was estimated for 3 weeks by total and viable cell counts. The numbers of EHEC were significantly higher when cultured with amoebae than without, and less EHEC shifted into a viable but nonculturable state in the presence of amoebae. Using several mutants, we observed that the Pho regulon is required for EHEC growth when cocultured with amoebae. In contrast, the Shiga toxins (Stx) were not involved in this association phenotype. Cocultures monitored by electron microscopy revealed a loss of the regular rod shape of EHEC and the secretion of multilamellar vesicles by the amoebae, which did not contain bacteria. As the interaction between A. castellanii and EHEC appears beneficial for bacterial growth, this supports a potential role for protozoa in promoting the persistence of EHEC in the environment.","1108":"Variant strains of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium, lacking one or both flagellar phases have been widely reported. The monophasic S.1,4,[5],12:i:- variant has emerged worldwide in the past few years and has become one of the most frequently encountered in many countries. In contrast, monophasic S.1,4,[5],12:-:1,2 and nonmotile S.1,4,[5],12:-:- strains are rarely described. This study investigated seven molecular markers to identify and delineate monophasic S.1,4,[5],12:i:- (n = 90), S.1,4,[5],12:-:1,2 (n = 25), nonmotile S.1,4,[5],12:-:- (n = 17) strains, and some serovar Typhimurium strains (n = 124) collected through the French Salmonella network between 2001 and 2010. Three markers were commonly detected in serovar Typhimurium and in all variant strains: STM2757, mdh and fliA-B. Monophasic S.1,4,[5],12:i:- were genotypically confirmed by the absence of the fljB, fljA, and hin genes. Nevertheless, 13 (14.5%) of them were positive for these last three genes, revealing monophasic strains named \"inconsistent\" as previously described. All nonmotile 1,4,[5],12:-:- strains had the fliC, fljA, fljB, and hin genes and the fliC gene was detected in 88% of monophasic S.1,4,[5],12:-:1,2 strains. The combination of the seven markers detection enables to recognize eight different genotypes within the S.1,4,[5],12:i:- collection, among which the Spanish and the U.S. clones previously described could be distinguished and assigned to a genotype. Based on this molecular approach, 71% of the French S.1,4,[5],12:i:- collection belonged to the Spanish clone, whereas only 2% were assigned to the U.S. clone. This study highlights the usefulness of these molecular markers and genotypes for identifying lineages, especially among the epidemiologically important monophasic S.1,4,[5],12:i:- variant.","1109":null,"1110":null,"1111":"Ergonomic growth phases of annual social insect societies strongly influence horizontally transmitted parasites. Herein, we focused on the impact of temporal changes in host demography on the population structure of a horizontally transmitted parasite. Seasonal fluctuations in prevalence and the occurrence of multiple infections of the gut parasite Crithidia bombi were analyzed in repeatedly sampled populations of two common bumblebee (Bombus spp.) species. Prevalence of C. bombi was greatest in the middle of the foraging season and coincided with the maximal occurrence of multiple infections. Both decline later in the season. The genetic structure of the parasite population also showed strong seasonal fluctuations with a drastic decline in effective population size and an increase in linkage disequilibrium when infection rates were highest. These effects are mainly attributable to significant changes in parasite allele frequencies leading to selection of specific alleles and increasing the frequency of homozygote genotypes in the middle of the season. Within host, competition between parasite genotypes might explain the observed pattern leading to selection of these alleles, and thus a boost of homozygote genotypes in the middle of the season. Toward the end of the season, selection appears to relax and we observed a recovery in linkage equilibrium, as well as an increase in effective population size. This might be explained by genetic exchange in these trypanosomes in natural populations.","1112":null,"1113":"Proteins are the most diverse structures on bacterial surfaces; hence, they are candidates for species- and strain-specific interactions of bacteria with the host, environment, and other microorganisms. Genomics has decoded thousands of bacterial surface and secreted proteins, yet the function of most cannot be predicted because of the enormous variability and a lack of experimental data that would allow deduction of function through homology. Here, we used phage display to identify a pair of interacting extracellular proteins in the probiotic bacterium Lactobacillus rhamnosus HN001. A secreted protein, SpcA, containing two bacterial immunoglobulin-like domains type 3 (Big-3) and a domain distantly related to plant pathogen response domain 1 (PR-1-like) was identified by screening of an L. rhamnosus HN001 library using HN001 cells as bait. The SpcA-\"docking\" protein, SpcB, was in turn detected by another phage display library screening, using purified SpcA as bait. SpcB is a 3275-residue cell-surface protein that contains general features of large glycosylated Serine-rich adhesins\/fibrils from gram-positive bacteria, including the hallmark signal sequence motif KxYKxGKxW. Both proteins are encoded by genes within a L. rhamnosus-unique gene cluster that distinguishes this species from other lactobacilli. To our knowledge, this is the first example of a secreted-docking protein pair identified in lactobacilli.","1114":"Cyclic AMP (cAMP) is a signaling molecule that is involved in the regulation of multiple virulence systems of the opportunistic pathogen Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The intracellular concentration of cAMP in P. aeruginosa cells is tightly controlled at the levels of cAMP synthesis and degradation through regulation of the activity and\/or expression of the adenylate cyclases CyaA and CyaB or the cAMP phosphodiesterase CpdA. Interestingly, mutants of fimL, which usually demonstrate defective twitching motility, frequently revert to a wild-type twitching-motility phenotype presumably via the acquisition of an extragenic suppressor mutation(s). In this study, we have characterized five independent fimL twitching-motility revertants and have determined that all have increased intracellular cAMP levels compared with the parent fimL mutant. Whole-genome sequencing revealed that only one of these fimL revertants has acquired a loss-of-function mutation in cpdA that accounts for the elevated levels of intracellular cAMP. As mutation of cpdA did not account for the restoration of twitching motility observed in the other four fimL revertants, these observations suggest that there is at least another, as yet unidentified, site of extragenic suppressor mutation that can cause phenotypic reversion in fimL mutants and modulation of intracellular cAMP levels of P. aeruginosa.","1115":"HlyU is a master regulator that plays an essential role in the virulence of the human pathogen Vibrio vulnificus. One of the most noteworthy characteristics of HlyU regulation in this organism is its positive control of the expression of the repeat-in-toxin (RtxA1) gene, one of the most important virulence factors accounting for the fulminating and damaging nature of V. vulnificus infections. In this work, we reviewed the latest studies of RtxA1 in this bacterium and highlight the mechanism of gene regulation of rtxA1 expression by HlyU under a broader gene regulatory network.","1116":null,"1117":"In Escherichia coli, coordinated activation and deactivation of DnaA allows for proper timing of the initiation of chromosomal synthesis at the origin of replication (oriC) and assures initiation occurs once per cell cycle. In vitro, acidic phospholipids reactivate DnaA, and in vivo depletion of acidic phospholipids, results in growth arrest. Growth can be restored by the expression of a mutant form of DnaA, DnaA(L366K), or by oriC-independent DNA synthesis, suggesting acidic phospholipids are required for DnaA- and oriC-dependent replication. We observe here that when acidic phospholipids were depleted, replication was inhibited with a concomitant reduction of chromosomal content and cell mass prior to growth arrest. This global shutdown of biosynthetic activity was independent of the stringent response. Restoration of acidic phospholipid synthesis resulted in a resumption of DNA replication prior to restored growth, indicating a possible cell-cycle-specific growth arrest had occurred with the earlier loss of acidic phospholipids. Flow cytometry, thymidine uptake, and quantitative polymerase chain reaction data suggest that a deficiency in acidic phospholipids prolonged the time required to replicate the chromosome. We also observed that regardless of the cellular content of acidic phospholipids, expression of mutant DnaA(L366K) altered the DNA content-to-cell mass ratio.","1118":null,"1119":null,"1120":"Temporal variations of intestinal microorganisms have been investigated in humans, but limited information is available for other animal species. The aim of the study was to evaluate the abundance and short-term temporal variability of fecal microbiota in dogs. Two fecal samples were collected (15 days apart) from six healthy dogs. The microbiota was evaluated using fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) and 454-pyrosequencing targeting the 16S rRNA and its gene. Pyrosequencing revealed 15 families comprising &gt;80% of all microbiota, over time intraindividual coefficients of variation (%CV) ranged from 2% to 141% (median: 55%). In contrast, the interindividual %CV ranged from 62% to 230% (median: 145%). Relative proportions of Faecalibacterium (important for intestinal health) and Subdoligranulum were low (two dogs harbored 4-7% of Subdoligranulum, the remaining dogs had &lt;1% of either genus). Conversely, FISH revealed that Faecalibacterium comprised a median of 5% of total counts (range: 0-8%, probe Fprau645). A novel FISH probe (Faecali 698) was tested that, compared with Fprau645, can detect in silico a similar percentage of Faecalibacterium but higher proportions of Subdoligranulum. This probe revealed a high percentage of Faecalibacterium-Subdoligranulum (median: 16% of total counts). Future studies should consider the observed variability and discrepancies in microbial abundance between FISH and 454-pyrosequencing.","1121":"Bacterial biofilms are complex cell communities found attached to surfaces and surrounded by an extracellular matrix composed of exopolysaccharides, DNA, and proteins. We investigated the whole-genome expression profile of Pseudomonas aeruginosa sessile cells (SCs) present in biofilms developed on a glass wool substratum. The transcriptome and proteome of SCs were compared with those of planktonic cell cultures. Principal component analysis revealed a biofilm-specific gene expression profile. Our study highlighted the overexpression of genes controlling the anthranilate degradation pathway in the SCs grown on glass wool for 24 h. In this condition, the metabolic pathway that uses anthranilate for Pseudomonas quinolone signal production was not activated, which suggested that anthranilate was primarily being consumed for energy metabolism. Transposon mutants defective for anthranilate degradation were analyzed in a simple assay of biofilm formation. The phenotypic analyses confirmed that P. aeruginosa biofilm formation partially depended on the activity of the anthranilate degradation pathway. This work points to a new feature concerning anthranilate metabolism in P. aeruginosa SCs.","1122":"The plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium Pseudomonas fluorescens WCS374r produces several iron-regulated metabolites, including the fluorescent siderophore pseudobactin (Psb374), salicylic acid (SA), and pseudomonine (Psm), a siderophore that contains a SA moiety. After purification of Psb374 from culture supernatant of WCS374r, its structure was determined following isoelectrofocusing and tandem mass spectrometry, and found to be identical to the fluorescent siderophore produced by P. fluorescens ATCC 13525. To study the role of SA and Psm production in colonization of Arabidopsis thaliana roots and in induced systemic resistance (ISR) against Pseudomonas syringae pv. tomato (Pst) by strain WCS374r, mutants disrupted in the production of these metabolites were obtained by homologous recombination. These mutants were further subjected to transposon Tn5 mutagenesis to generate mutants also deficient in Psb374 production. The mutants behaved similar to the wild type in both their Arabidopsis rhizosphere-colonizing capacity and their ability to elicit ISR against Pst. We conclude that Psb374, SA, and Psm production by P. fluorescens WCS374r are not required for eliciting ISR in Arabidopsis.","1123":null,"1124":"Homologous recombination among repetitive sequences is an important mode of DNA repair in eukaryotes following acute radiation exposure. We have developed an assay in Saccharomyces cerevisiae that models how multiple DNA double-strand breaks form chromosomal translocations by a nonconservative homologous recombination mechanism, single-strand annealing, and identified the Rad52 paralog, Rad59, as an important factor. We show through genetic and molecular analyses that Rad59 possesses distinct Rad52-dependent and -independent functions, and that Rad59 plays a critical role in the localization of Rad52 to double-strand breaks. Our analysis further suggests that Rad52 and Rad59 act in multiple, sequential processes that determine genome structure following acute exposure to DNA damaging agents.","1125":"We investigated the prevalence of the virulence genes specific for five major pathogroups of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli (DEC) in primary cultures from feces of animals slaughtered for human consumption in Burkina Faso. For the study, 704 feces samples were collected from cattle (n = 304), chickens (n = 350), and pigs (n = 50) during carcass processing. The presence of the virulence-associated genes in the mixed bacterial cultures was assessed using 16-plex polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Virulence genes indicating presence of DEC were detected in 48% of the cattle, 48% of the chicken, and 68% of the pig feces samples. Virulence genes specific for different DECs were detected in the following percentages of the cattle, chicken, and pig feces samples: Shiga toxin-producing E. coli (STEC) in 37%, 6%, and 30%; enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) in 8%, 37%, and 32%; enterotoxigenic E. coli (ETEC) in 4%, 5%, and 18%; and enteroaggregative E. coli (EAEC) in 7%, 6%, and 32%. Enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) virulence genes were detected in 1% of chicken feces samples only. The study was the first of its kind in Burkina Faso and revealed the common occurrence of the diarrheal virulence genes in feces of food animals. This indicates that food animals are reservoirs of DEC that may contaminate meat because of the defective slaughter and storage conditions and pose a health risk to the consumers in Burkina Faso.","1126":"Soluble (S-type) pyocins are Pseudomonas aeruginosa bacteriocins that kill nonimmune P. aeruginosa cells by gaining entry via a specific receptor, which, in the case of pyocin S2, is the siderophore pyoverdine receptor FpvAI, and in the case of pyocin S3, FpvAII. The nucleic acid sequence at the positions 4327697-4327359 of P. aeruginosa PAO1 genome was not annotated, but it was predicted to encode the immunity gene of the flanking pyocin S4 gene (PA3866) based on our analysis of the genome sequence. Using RT-PCR, the expression of the immunity gene was detected, confirming the existence of an immunity gene overlapping the S4 pyocin gene. The PA3866 coding for pyocin S4 and the downstream gene coding for the immunity protein were cloned and expressed in Escherichia coli and the His-tagged S4 pyocin was obtained in pure form. Forty-three P. aeruginosa strains were typed via PCR to identify their ferripyoverdine receptor gene (fpvAI-III) and were tested for their sensitivity to pyocin S4. All S4-sensitive strains had the type I ferripyoverdine receptor fpvA gene. Some S4-resistant type I fpvA-positive strains were detected, but all of them had the S4 immunity gene, and, following the deletion of the immunity gene, became S4-sensitive. The fpvAI receptor gene was deleted in a S4-sensitive strain, and, as expected, the mutant became resistant to S4. The N-terminal receptor binding domain (RBD) of pyocin S2, which also uses the FpvAI receptor to enter the cell, was cloned in the pET-15b vector, and expressed in E. coli. When the purified RBD was mixed with pyocin S4 at different ratios, an inhibition of killing was observed, indicating that S2 RBD competes with the pyocin S4 for the binding to the FpvAI receptor. The S2 RBD was also shown to enhance the expression of the pvdA pyoverdine gene, suggesting that it, like pyoverdine, works via the known siderophore-mediated signalization pathway.","1127":"The Salmonella enterica species includes about 2600 diverse serotypes, most of which cause a wide range of food- and water-borne diseases ranging from self-limiting gastroenteritis to typhoid fever in both humans and animals. Moreover, some serotypes are restricted to a few animal species, whereas other serotypes are able to infect plants as well as cold- and warm-blooded animals. An essential feature of the pathogenicity of Salmonella is its capacity to cross a number of barriers requiring invasion of a large variety of phagocytic and nonphagocytic cells. The aim of this review is to describe the different entry pathways used by Salmonella serotypes to enter different nonphagocytic cell types. Until recently, it was accepted that Salmonella invasion of eukaryotic cells required only the type III secretion system (T3SS) encoded by the Salmonella pathogenicity island-1. However, recent evidence shows that Salmonella can cause infection in a T3SS-1-independent manner. Currently, two outer membrane proteins Rck and PagN have been clearly identified as Salmonella invasins. As Rck mediates a Zipper-like entry mechanism, Salmonella is therefore the first bacterium shown to be able to induce both Zipper and Trigger mechanisms to invade host cells. In addition to these known entry pathways, recent data have shown that unknown entry routes could be used according to the serotype, the host and the cell type considered, inducing either Zipper-like or Trigger-like entry processes. The new paradigm presented here should change our classic view of Salmonella pathogenicity. It could also modify our understanding of the mechanisms leading to the different Salmonella-induced diseases and to Salmonella-host specificity.","1128":"Burkholderia cenocepacia has emerged as an important pathogen for patients suffering from cystic fibrosis (CF). Previous work has shown that this organism employs the CepIR quorum-sensing (QS) system to control the expression of virulence factors as well as the formation of biofilms. To date, however, very little is known about the QS-regulated virulence factors and virtually nothing about the factors that link QS and biofilm formation. Here, we have employed a combined transcriptomic and proteomic approach to precisely define the QS regulon in our model strain B. cenocepacia H111, a CF isolate. Among the identified CepR-activated loci, three were analyzed in better detail for their roles in biofilm development: (i) a gene cluster coding for the BclACB lectins, (ii) the large surface protein BapA, and (iii) a type I pilus. The analysis of defined mutants revealed that BapA plays a major role in biofilm formation on abiotic surfaces while inactivation of the type I pilus showed little effect both in a static microtitre dish-based biofilm assay and in flow-through cells. Inactivation of the bclACB lectin genes resulted in biofilms containing hollow microcolonies, suggesting that the lectins are important for biofilm structural development.","1129":"Despite the importance of incubation assays for studies in microbial ecology that frequently require long confinement times, few reports are available in which changes in the assemblage structure of aquatic prokaryotes were monitored during long-term incubations. We measured rates of dissolved organic carbon degradation and microbial respiration by consumption of dissolved oxygen (DO) in four experiments with Lake Kinneret near-surface water and, concomitantly, we analyzed the variability in prokaryotic community structure during long-term dark bottle incubations. During the first 24 h, there were only minor changes in bacterial community composition. Thereafter there were marked changes in the prokaryotic community structure during the incubations. In contrast, oxygen consumption rates (a proxy for both respiration and dissolved organic carbon degradation rates) remained stable for up to 10-23 days. This study is one of the first to examine closely the phylo-genetic changes that occur in the microbial community of untreated freshwater during long-term (days) incubations in dark, sealed containers. Novel information on the diversity of the main bacterial phylotypes that may be involved in dissolved organic matter degradation in lake Kinneret is also provided. Our results suggest that, under certain ecological settings, constant community metabolic rates can be maintained as a result of shifts in community composition.","1130":null,"1131":"Saccharomyces cerevisiae wild-type (BY4741) and the corresponding mutant lacking the plasma membrane main potassium uptake systems (trk1,trk2) were used to analyze the consequences of K(+) starvation following a proteomic approach. In order to trigger high-affinity mode of potassium transport, cells were transferred to potassium-free medium. Protein profile was followed by two-dimensional (2-D) gels in samples taken at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180, and 300 min during starvation. We observed a general decrease of protein content during starvation that was especially drastic in the mutant strain as it was the case of an important number of proteins involved in glycolysis. On the contrary, we identified proteins related to stress response and alternative energetic metabolism that remained clearly present. Neural network-based analysis indicated that wild type was able to adapt much faster than the mutant to the stress process. We conclude that complete potassium starvation is a stressful process for yeast cells, especially for potassium transport mutants, and we propose that less stressing conditions should be used in order to study potassium homeostasis in yeast.","1132":"A total proteome map of the Pseudomonas aeruginosa PAO1 proteome is presented, generated by a combination of two-dimensional gel electrophoresis and protein identification by mass spectrometry. In total, 1128 spots were visualized, and 181 protein spots were characterized, corresponding to 159 different protein entries. In particular, protein chaperones and enzymes important in energy conversion and amino acid biosynthesis were identified. Spot analysis always resulted in the identification of a single protein, suggesting sufficient spot resolution, although the same protein may be detected in two or more neighboring spots, possibly indicating posttranslational modifications. Comparison to the theoretical proteome revealed an underrepresentation of membrane proteins, though the identified proteins cover all predicted subcellular localizations and all functional classes. These data provide a basis for subsequent comparative studies of the biology and metabolism of P. aeruginosa, aimed at unraveling global regulatory networks.","1133":"Flavor production among 12 strains of Debaryomyces hansenii when grown on a simple cheese model mimicking a cheese surface was investigated by dynamic headspace sampling followed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. The present study confirmed that D. hansenii possess the ability to produce important cheese flavor compounds, primarily branched-chain aldehydes and alcohols, and thus important for the final cheese flavor. Quantification of representative aldehydes (2-Methylpropanal, 3-Methylbutanal) and alcohols (2-Methyl-1-propanol, 3-Methyl-1-butanol, and 3-Methyl-3-buten-1-ol) showed that the investigated D. hansenii strains varied significantly with respect to production of these flavor compounds. Contrary to the alcohols (2-Methyl-1-propanol, 3-Methyl-1-butanol, and 3-Methyl-3-buten-1-ol), the aldehydes (2-Methylpropanal, 3-Methylbutanal) were produced by the D. hansenii strains in concentrations higher than their sensory threshold values, and thus seemed more important than alcohols for cheese flavor. These results show that D. hansenii strains may have potential to be applied as cultures for increasing the nutty\/malty flavor of cheese due to their production of aldehydes. However, due to large strain variations, production of flavor compounds has to be taken into consideration for selection of D. hansenii strains as starter cultures for cheese production.","1134":"Motility in Aeromonas caviae, in a liquid environment (in broth culture), is mediated by a single polar flagellum encoded by the fla genes. The polar flagellum filament of A. caviae is composed of two flagellin subunits, FlaA and FlaB, which undergo O-linked glycosylation with six to eight pseudaminic acid glycans linked to serine and threonine residues in their central region. The flm genetic locus in A. caviae is required for flagellin glycosylation and the addition of pseudaminic acid (Pse) onto the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) O-antigen. However, none of the flm genes appear to encode a candidate glycotransferase that might add the Pse moiety to FlaA\/B. The motility-associated factors (Maf proteins) are considered as candidate transferase enzymes, largely due to their conserved proximity to flagellar biosynthesis loci in a number of pathogens. Bioinformatic analysis performed in this study indicated that the genome of A. caviae encodes a single maf gene homologue (maf1). A maf mutant was generated and phenotypic analysis showed it is both nonmotile and lacks polar flagella. In contrast to flm mutants, it had no effect on the LPS O-antigen pattern and has the ability to swarm. Analysis of flaA transcription by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) showed that its transcription was unaltered in the maf mutant while a His-tagged version of the FlaA flagellin protein produced from a plasmid was detected in an unglycosylated intracellular form in the maf strain. Complementation of the maf strain in trans partially restored motility, but increased levels of glycosylated flagellin to above wild-type levels. Overexpression of maf inhibited motility, indicating a dominant negative effect, possibly caused by high amounts of glycosylated flagellin inhibiting assembly of the flagellum. These data provide evidence that maf1, a pseudaminyl transferase, is responsible for glycosylation of flagellin and suggest that this event occurs prior to secretion through the flagellar Type III secretion system.","1135":"The objective of this study was to phylogenetically analyze microorganisms from the domains Bacteria and Archaea in hypersaline sediment from Death Valley National Park. Using domain-specific primers, a region of the 16S rRNA gene was amplified using polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and the product was subsequently used to create a clone library. A total of 243 bacterial clones, 99 archaeal clones, and 209 bacterial isolates were examined. The 243 clones from Bacteria were affiliated with the following groups: the Bacilli (59 clones) and Clostridia (1) of the Firmicutes, Bacteroidetes (90), Proteobacteria (27), Cyanobacteria (18), Gemmatimonadetes (41), candidate division OP1 (5), Actinobacteria (1), and the Deinococcus-Thermus division (1). Within the class Bacilli, 46 of 59 clones were tentatively identified as 10 unclassified species. The majority of bacterial isolates (130 of 209) were more closely related to the Bacillus subtilis-B. licheniformis clade than to any other recognized taxon, and an Ecotype Simulation analysis of B. subtilis relatives identified four previously unknown ecotypes. Several new genera were discovered within the Bacteroidetes (4) and the Gemmatimonadetes (2). Of the 99 archaeal clones, 94 were tentatively identified as belonging to 3 new genera within the Halobacteriaceae; other clones represented novel species within each of 4 established genera.","1136":null,"1137":"The zinc-responsive Zap1 transcription factor of Saccharomyces cerevisiae controls many genes involved in zinc homeostasis. Zap1 has two activation domains, AD1 and AD2, which are independently regulated by zinc. While AD1 can fully activate most Zap1 target genes, AD2 is active only on a subset of those genes. One hypothesis explaining this promoter specificity was that AD1 and AD2 recruit different coactivators. To address this question, we carried out a genetic screen to identify coactivator complexes that are required for Zap1-mediated activation. SWI\/SNF, SAGA, and Mediator complexes were implicated as playing major roles in Zap1 activation. Consistent with this conclusion, we found that these three complexes are recruited to Zap1 target promoters in a zinc-responsive and Zap1-dependent manner. Coactivator recruitment was highly interdependent such that mutations disrupting SAGA impaired recruitment of SWI\/SNF and vice versa. Optimal Mediator recruitment was dependent on both SAGA and SWI\/SNF. A comparison of the coactivators recruited by AD1 and AD2 found no obvious differences suggesting that recruitment of different coactivators is not likely the mechanism of AD specificity. Rather, our results suggest that AD2 recruits coactivators less effectively than AD1 and is therefore only functional on some promoters.","1138":null,"1139":null,"1140":"Type VI secretion systems (T6SS) are macromolecular complexes present in Gram-negative bacteria. T6SS are structurally similar to the bacteriophage cell-puncturing device and have been shown to mediate bacteria-host or bacteria-bacteria interactions. T6SS assemble from 13 to 20 proteins. In enteroaggregative Escherichia coli (EAEC), one of the subassemblies is composed of four proteins that form a trans-envelope complex: the TssJ outer membrane lipoprotein, the peptidoglycan-anchored inner membrane TagL protein, and two putative inner membrane proteins, TssL and TssM. In this study, we characterized the TssL protein of the EAEC Sci-1 T6SS in terms of localization, topology, and function. TssL is a critical component of the T6SS, anchored to the inner membrane through a single transmembrane segment located at the extreme C-terminus of the protein. We further show that this transmembrane segment is essential for the function of the protein and its proper insertion in the inner membrane is dependent upon YidC and modulated by the Hsp70 homologue DnaK.","1141":null,"1142":null,"1143":"Recently, copper (Cu) in its metallic form has regained interest for its antimicrobial properties. Use of metallic Cu surfaces in worldwide hospital trials resulted in remarkable reductions in surface contaminations. Yet, our understanding of why microbes are killed upon contact to the metal is still limited and different modes of action have been proposed. This knowledge, however, is crucial for sustained use of such surfaces in hospitals and other hygiene-sensitive areas. Here, we report on the molecular mechanisms by which the Gram-positive Staphylococcus haemolyticus is inactivated by metallic Cu. Staphylococcus haemolyticus was killed within minutes on Cu but not on stainless steel demonstrating the antimicrobial efficacy of metallic Cu. Inductively coupled plasma mass spectroscopy (ICP-MS) analysis and in vivo staining with Coppersensor-1 indicated that cells accumulated large amounts of Cu ions from metallic Cu surfaces contributing to lethal damage. Mutation rates of Cu- or steel-exposed cells were similarly low. Instead, live\/dead staining indicated cell membrane damage in Cu- but not steel-exposed cells. These findings support a model of the cellular targets of metallic Cu toxicity in bacteria, which suggests that metallic Cu is not genotoxic and does not kill via DNA damage. In contrast, membranes constitute the likely Achilles' heel of Cu surface-exposed cells.","1144":null,"1145":null,"1146":null,"1147":"A bacterial strain, Myt-1, was isolated in Toyama Bay in Toyama Prefecture, Japan.

A 16S rDNA homology search revealed that the closest relative of Myt-1 was Saccharophagus degradans 2-40 (CP000282; 100% similarity), which was first isolated in Chesapeake Bay in Virginia, USA. The Myt-1 strain was capable of degrading more than 10 polysaccharides, almost all of which were also degraded by S. degradans 2-40. Analyses of alginase gene DNA sequence homology, DNA-DNA homology, and zymogram analysis of obtained polysaccharidases suggested that Myt-1 was a new species of Saccharophagus. Thus, Myt-1 is only the second species in this genus, which has contained only one strain and species since 1988, and was tentatively designated Saccharophagus sp. Myt-1. Myt-1 has considerable potential for reducing the volume of seaweed wastes, and for producing functional materials from seaweed substrate.","1148":""},"articletitle":{"0":"Concomitant knockout of
