"1433":1433,"1434":1434},"abstracttext":{"0":"Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (PD) is one of the treatment methods used for end-stage renal failure. When mechanical complications occur with this treatment method, methods such as tomographic peritoneography, abdominal scintigraphy, and magnetic resonance peritoneography are used to uncover the problem. Here, we report the detection by tomographic peritoneography of a subcutaneous dialysate leak in a patient undergoing PD. The PD catheter was subsequently removed, and a new catheter was inserted. The patient then restarted continuous ambulatory PD without any problem.","1":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is one of the treatment options for patients with end-stage renal failure. To start PD treatment, a catheter must be placed for access to the abdominal cavity, and it can be placed using surgical, laparoscopic, or percutaneous methods. However, complications can develop during catheter placement.In the present case report, we describe a patient in whom treatment was pursued after an unusual complication rarely mentioned in the literature: a dialysis catheter accidentally inserted percutaneously into the bladder. Under ultrasonography guidance, the catheter was pulled from the urinary bladder and pushed into the intra-abdominal cavity. No complications resulted from the procedure, and the patient proceeded to PD treatment. This case is, to our knowledge, the only such report in the literature.","2":null,"3":"Exit-site infection poses a risk for peritonitis and can shorten peritoneal dialysis (PD) vintage. A loose fit of the skin around the catheter at the exit site can push bacteria surrounding the catheter into the subcutaneous tunnel. Negative-pressure wound therapy (NPWT) has been used to hasten healing of the wound after an operation or to treat pressure ulcers. We hypothesized that NPWT could speed the healing of the exit site and tighten the fit of the skin around the catheter. Using a V.A.C. Therapy system [vacuum-assisted closure (KCI, San Antonio, TX, U.S.A.)], NPWT was therefore applied in 9 patients for 1 - 2 weeks after the PD catheter insertion operation. Results in those patients were compared with results in patients who did not receive NPWT.The healed exit site was classified as either tightly fitted (when the skin was tightly connected around the PD catheter) or loosely fitted (when the skin was not tightly connected around the catheter). The relevant data were retrieved from the medical record and analyzed retrospectively.Patients who received NPWT had a tight exit site after 1 - 2 weeks. Those who did not receive NPWT did not have a tight exit site after 1 - 2 weeks. No bleeding was observed in patients receiving NPWT. Bleeding from the exit site after the catheter insertion operation was observed in 3 patients not receiving NPWT.Because we use a fine trocar to make the subcutaneous catheter tunnel, bleeding from the vasculature can often be observed. That bleeding could be minimized with the application of NPWT. Negative pressure could also hasten wound healing and result in a tight fit of the skin around the catheter within in 1 - 2 weeks compared with the 1 month typically required with the use of conventional film dressings.Negative-pressure wound therapy is beneficial for creating a tight fit of the skin to the catheter within 1 - 2 weeks and might reduce the number of exit-site and tunnel infections, which could result in a reduction in the peritonitis rate.","4":"A 67-year-old white man with a history of end-stage renal disease receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) presented with acute onset of vomiting, chills, and abdominal pain. He was diagnosed with PD-associated peritonitis secondary to Pasteurella. After failure of 3 weeks of antibiotic treatment, catheter loss occurred. On follow-up, the patient was found to have extensive intra-abdominal adhesions precluding placement of a new PD catheter.","5":"Peritonitis is a major complication in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, often requiring a switch to hemodialysis (HD). Common sources of bacterial peritonitis are touch contamination and PD catheter-related infection. Intra-abdominal pathology is a less common cause of peritonitis in PD patients, and rarely is Neisseria mucosa the causative organism.We present an uncommon case of N. mucosa peritonitis in a 30-year-old African American female patient treated with nocturnal intermittent PD. The infection occurred in the setting of a translocated intrauterine contraceptive device (IUCD) in the infrahepatic region because of transmural migration. Our patient underwent laparoscopic removal of the IUCD and received empiric intraperitoneal (IP) vancomycin and intravenous ceftriaxone. After the isolate was identified as N. mucosa, her regimen was changed to IP ceftriaxone for a total of 21 days. Cell count after completion of antibiotics showed resolution of the peritonitis. The PD catheter was salvaged and transition to HD was avoided.","6":"To avoid loss of residual renal function (RRF) and to enhance solute clearance, we sometimes, from the initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy, combine PD with hemodialysis (HD) that removes little or no fluid. In one typical valuable case, a 51-year-old woman with diabetic nephropathy who selected combined PD and HD therapy as her first dialysis method has continued on that therapy for 10 years. Her dialysis schedule consists of 5 PD days and 1 HD day without fluid removal weekly. Because this combination therapy was proactively started at dialysis initiation, good fluid control could be kept with urinary excretion and PD ultrafiltration. Stable peritoneal equilibration test data indicate that peritoneal resting might be expected to be beneficial for the preservation of peritoneal function. This case demonstrates that proactive combination therapy can be extremely useful for preserving both RRF and peritoneal function, indicating a good prognosis.","7":null,"8":"Telehealth encompasses a broad variety of technologies and tactics to deliver virtual medical, health, and education services. Telemedicine is the use of electronic communications for the exchange of medical information from one site to another to improve a patient's clinical health status.Several studies show that, by providing better patient oversight and communication, telehealth in PD enhances patient care, outcomes, quality of care, and satisfaction. Associated benefits include increased patient retention to home dialysis, reduced use of hospital services, and reduced costs of care.The sustainability of telehealth had been limited by reimbursement and regulatory restrictions. The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) limited services related to end-stage renal disease by providing reimbursement for telehealth only in rural areas or counties outside of a metropolitan statistical area. Moreover, the dialysis facility and the patient's home were not approved as originating sites. However, effective January 1, 2019, those restrictions will be lifted. Telehealth will require that home dialysis patients be established with 3 initial face-to-face monthly clinical assessments without the use of telehealth; after those initial 3 months, a face-to-face visit at least once every 3 consecutive months will be required. Claims can be submitted using designated Current Procedural Terminology codes and modifiers.The actual extension of telehealth to home dialysis patients will depend on the details of forthcoming CMS regulations.","9":null,"10":"Compared with hemodialysis (HD), peritoneal dialysis (PD) is associated with reduced cost and improved quality of life. But despite those benefits, PD represents a small percentage of the renal replacement therapy performed. Although a number of factors contribute to that situation, peritoneal drop-out is a complex issue that leads to as much as a 35% annual transition from PD to in-center HD. The reasons for drop-out are multifaceted and include contributions from the patient or caregiver, health care regulatory systems, and factors intrinsic to the PD modality. In this review, we focus on specific causes of PD drop-out and on prevention and intervention strategies that can improve success and duration on PD.","11":null,"12":"Urea kinetics (weekly Kt\/V) greater than 1.7 generally define adequate peritoneal dialysis (PD). Adequacy of PD depends on residual renal function and PD clearance. Preserving residual renal function and peritoneal membrane characteristics helps to maintain PD adequacy.The dose of PD can be augmented by increasing the total dialysate volume. Greater volume can be achieved by increasing either the fill volume per exchange or the number of exchanges. Increased time on dialysis can be achieved by keeping PD fluid in the peritoneal cavity at all times. Increasing the convective force enhances solute removal with ultrafiltration.Incremental PD is used during urgent starts and in patients who are newly starting or who have been on PD. Urgent starts require use of frequent low-volume exchanges to avoid leaks at surgical sites. The dialysate volume can be gradually increased provided that no leakage occurs, up to approximately 2 L per exchange on day 14 for an average-size adult. New-start patients require only 1 - 2 exchanges daily if they still have residual renal function. Incremental PD retains patients on PD as residual renal function wanes and peritoneal membrane characteristics change because of dextrose exposure, infection, and inflammation.Use of a cycler permits patients to achieve adequacy by increasing the volume per cycle and the number of cycles per treatment. Using a non-dextrose-based solution, such as icodextrin, allows patients to achieve adequate ultrafiltration with less dextrose exposure.Adequate dialysis can be achieved by manipulating the dialysate dwell volume and the frequency of exchanges, and by optimizing ultrafiltration.","13":null,"14":"","15":null,"16":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) combination therapy is considered for the improvement of ultrafiltration failure and uremic symptoms in PD patients with loss of residual renal function (RRF). However, a rapid decline in RRF is one of the critical drawbacks to such therapy. In contrast, we started patients on combination therapy as a proactive option at the initiation of dialysis.In patients on HD (n = 52), PD (n = 21), and combination dialysis (n = 13), we studied changes in RRF, blood parameters, and peritoneal permeability for 30 months. Residual renal function was better preserved in patients who received PD and HD combination therapy from the start of the dialysis therapy than in patients who received HD alone, and serum albumin was better preserved in the combination-therapy patients than in the patients who received PD alone. No significant differences in peritoneal permeability were observed between the patients on PD and those on combination therapy. Blood parameters were not significantly different between the three groups.Because our proactive combination therapy option has beneficial effects compared with HD or PD therapy alone, combination therapy should be considered a new modality of renal replacement therapy.","17":null,"18":"Healing Touch therapies use a practitioner's intentional placement of hands to influence the patient's energy fields to promote self-healing. In the changing climate of health care, in which the patient experience increasingly drives reimbursements, it is vital to find unique and meaningful ways beyond traditional medical therapies to ensure positive patient experiences. To that end, our peritoneal dialysis clinic staff adopted Jean Watson's theoretical framework, by which patients are treated as whole unique individuals with a \"multidimensional system of energy, with a consciousness that can be affected by another to promote well-being.\" In a rapidly growing urban clinic of more than 100 patients, our nurses identified the need to provide more ways to improve patient care.Staff were educated on ways to set positive intentions for patient contacts and to incorporate patient narratives into contact. Optional daily prayer was initiated, and patients were invited to attend a new support group for peritoneal dialysis patients and their families. In addition, a preliminary pilot provided Healing Touch treatments to interested patients. That pilot was associated with improvement in 4 of 5 measured categories. Fatigue and pain decreased by 46% and 68% respectively. Stress and anxiety fell by 49%, and a large drop of 84% in depression was observed. Nausea was unchanged.","19":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an umbrella term that encompasses a variety of techniques such as continuous ambulatory PD, automated PD, tidal PD, and intermittent PD, among others. The various techniques exist to tailor the PD prescription to meet the goals of individual patients. Various clinical and nonclinical factors can change over time, requiring a change to the PD prescription. This article uses a practical case study to highlight the intricacies of the calculations behind PD prescription to achieve clearance goals. The objective is to demonstrate that all modalities of PD should be considered in the spectrum of clinical tools for achieving adequate dialysis.","20":"Peritonitis is an important cause of morbidity, mortality, and technique failure in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). The most effective approach to peritonitis is prevention, which includes careful patient training and follow-up. Although peritonitis as a result of contiguous spread of bacteria or fungi during invasive procedures, or as a result of seeding of the peritoneum during bacteremia, is uncommon, the likelihood of such spread is often predictable, and the risk can be mitigated with antibiotic prophylaxis. Here, we describe the rationale for, and approach to, antibiotic prophylaxis in PD patients for the prevention of infective episodes.","21":"Complications of peritoneal dialysis (PD) create a significant burden for patients and providers. Some complications, such as infections and leaks, are preventable or easily treatable; however, potential fatal complications, such as encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS), cost patients their lives. Here, we present the case of a PD patient who might have had early, subtle, but ominous symptoms and signs of EPS, diagnosed in its early stages and promptly managed.A 57-year-old man who had been receiving PD for 6 years began having recurrent episodes of abdominal pain, blood-tinged effluent, and peritonitis. Even after successful treatment of his peritonitis episode, his dialysate effluent would be intermittently hazy or pinkish. When he presented with similar complaints for the third time, he was diagnosed with EPS after laparoscopy for further evaluation during his hospitalization.Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis is a rare complication of PD. The advanced stages of EPS with \"EPS syndrome\" portend a grave prognosis because of small-bowel obstruction, malnutrition, infection, and death. Early recognition and timely intervention can be a strategy to potentially prevent the progression of EPS.","22":"Endogenous peritonitis resulting from inflammation or perforation of an abdominal viscus-a result, for example, of diverticulitis, cholecystitis, or acute appendicitis-can be a complication in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), with significant morbidity and a high incidence of catheter loss.Here, we describe an end-stage renal disease patient on PD who presented with acute abdominal pain and who was diagnosed with uncomplicated PD peritonitis. His clinical course was complicated by development of eosinophilic peritonitis because of an allergy to vancomycin. Subsequently, when he failed to show clinical improvement, abdominal and pelvic imaging revealed severe appendicitis, which necessitated emergent surgical intervention.","23":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an excellent treatment option for the patients with end-stage renal disease, having been shown to yield improved patient satisfaction and economic benefit. Many surgeons and physicians believe that patients with prior abdominal surgeries or other abdominal complications are not viable candidates for PD and that prevalent PD patients needing abdominal surgery should be switched to hemodialysis. The purpose of the present review is to address those misconceptions.Our review of literature shows that, when appropriately planned, PD can still be an acceptable option for patients with end-stage renal disease and certain abdominal complications, including abdominal surgery, provided that the peritoneum is not compromised. Anticipating complications-and changing the PD prescription accordingly-can allow many such patients to continue PD without any interruption, thus maintaining their lifestyle and avoiding an increase in medical expense.","24":"Hernias and peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter leaks are frequent complications in patients on PD. Transplant recipients have multiple risk factors for delayed wound healing, such as use of corticosteroids and sirolimus, and the presence of uremia and diabetes mellitus. We report a rare occurrence of incisional hernia attributable to internal wound dehiscence after PD catheter placement in a patient on sirolimus.A 34-year-old Latino American man was started on PD training 4 weeks after placement of a PD catheter. Soon after completing training, he developed a large soft bulge close to the PD catheter, with expansile cough impulse suggestive of an incisional hernia filled with peritoneal dialysate. The size of the bulge would decrease after the dialysate was drained. No external leak of dialysate was evident along the exit site.Because of the size of the hernia and the history of it filling soon after dialysis exchange, the feeling was that wound dehiscence had occurred from the peritoneal side, resulting in a large incisional hernia. Because of the large size of the hernia within few weeks of starting PD, sirolimus was suspected to have induced poor wound healing, contributing to formation of the hernia.Sirolimus was stopped, and the patient underwent PD catheter removal and repair of the hernia. A new PD catheter was placed on the opposite side of the abdomen 10 days later. After another 6 weeks, the patient was started on PD. He has been doing well for the 15 months since then, with no recurrence of the hernia. Because he still had residual renal function, he continued to receive low-dose prednisone and mycophenolate sodium. At 10 months after PD start, he stopped the mycophenolate sodium on his own, and we did not resume it. He is still on low-dose prednisone.In end-stage renal disease resulting from failing renal transplantation or from calcineurin inhibitor nephropathy in solid-organ transplantation, sirolimus is a risk factor for wound dehiscence, development of incisional hernia, and peritoneal dialysate leak.Practical tips: Sirolimus should be stopped several days before PD catheter placement. Sirolimus should also be stopped if a PD catheter leak is detected or if incisional hernia develops soon after initiation of PD. Sirolimus should be held till surgical repair of the hernia and removal and replacement of the catheter.","25":"Upon peritoneal dialysis (PD) discontinuation in frail patients, we have re-embedded the catheter and left it subcutaneously buried. However, we have not evaluated the long-term prognosis of those patients after the procedure or the complications associated with buried catheters. We therefore aimed to clarify the long-term prognosis of patients with a re-embedded catheter and to identify any associated complications.The outcomes of 10 patients having a catheter that was re-embedded between February 2010 and May 2016 were assessed by interviewing the patients or their families (when possible), and by reviewing medical records.Catheter re-embedding to reduce the surgical burden was elected by 7 patients, and 3 patients underwent re-embedding because they wanted to resume PD in the future. By the time of the interviews, 6 patients had already died of causes that were unrelated either to the buried catheter or infection. No abnormality was found in any buried catheter. A re-embedded catheter was later externalized to resume PD in 1 of the 4 patients who survived.Catheter re-embedding is safe and allows for PD resumption at the terminal stage of dialysis.","26":"The results of several recent studies indicate that the practice of peritoneal dialysis catheter (PDC) insertion by nephrologists is safe. However, few studies have addressed the important issue of safety in surgeries related to PD, including PDC removal and other types of surgery. In the present study, we aimed to verify whether the incidence of early postoperative complications for surgical procedures related to PD and performed by nephrologists meets the audit standards of clinical practice guidelines for peritoneal access.Between April 2008 and July 2016 at our hospital, 282 patients underwent various types of PD-related surgery conducted by 17 nephrologists. The surgery types were the Moncrief-Popovich technique (n = 74), PDC exteriorization (n = 62), conventional laparotomy insertion (n = 29), PDC removal (n = 70), partial replacement (n = 32), unroofing or cuff shaving (n = 7), and others (n = 8).Bowel perforation and significant hemorrhage did not occur at the time of PDC insertion and removal. Although peritonitis was not evident, exit-site and tunnel infection within 2 weeks of PDC insertion by conventional laparotomy or exteriorization after the Moncrief-Popovich technique occurred in 3 of 91 patients (3.3%). The PDC malfunctioned in 2 of 103 patients (1.9%) after the Moncrief-Popovich technique because of PDC occlusion with a fibrin plug. Dialysate leaks occurred in 2 of 103 patients (1.9%). Partial replacement and unroofing or cuff shaving for refractory PDC infection and other type of surgeries were not associated with serious complications.The incidence of complications after surgery related to PD was low at our institution. The incidences of complications met the audit standards in the guidelines, indicating that surgery by nephrologists is safe and effective.","27":"Coagulopathies and bleeding disorders can affect dialysis outcomes by increasing the thrombosis risk at the arteriovenous access or by causing prolonged bleeding at access or catheter sites. We present the case of a 68-year-old woman with combined antiphospholipid syndrome and factor XI deficiency, with chronic prolongation of activated partial thromboplastin time that was not correctable with fresh-frozen plasma (FFP).The patient had a history of stroke, but was not on antiplatelet therapy because of mucocutaneous bleeding events. She had progressive renal failure attributed to her autoimmune disease, and a decision was made to pursue peritoneal dialysis (PD) when she reached end-stage kidney disease. She was admitted to the hospital the day before her planned PD catheter placement and was transfused with FFP and platelets before placement of a temporary hemodialysis catheter. One session of hemodialysis was performed to minimize uremic platelet dysfunction. The patient was given additional FFP and platelets at the time of PD catheter placement; desmopressin was not used. No thrombotic or bleeding complications occurred, and at 8 months out, the patient has been doing well on PD.In summary, careful perioperative planning led to successful PD initiation in a patient with combined bleeding and clotting disorders.","28":"Patients with end-stage renal failure are believed to have an increase of oxidative stress. However, any variation in oxidative stress between patients receiving hemodialysis (HD) and those receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) are still unclear. In the present study, we investigated variation in oxidative stress in 54 HD and 23 PD patients during their initial dialysis period.We measured serum pentosidine and indoxylsulfuric acid as markers of oxidative stress every 6 months from the start of the dialysis therapy to 30 months of treatment. Serum pentosidine was significantly lower in the PD patients than in the HD patients. Serum indoxylsulfuric acid was also significantly lower in the PD group compared with the HD group at 6, 12, and 18 months. Compared with the HD patients, the PD patients maintained significantly higher urine volumes (a marker of residual renal function) throughout the study, except at 24 months.Our findings demonstrate that, compared with HD patients, PD patients experience lower levels of oxidative stress because of higher preserved residual renal function during the initial dialysis period.","29":"Free water transport (FWT) during peritoneal dialysis (PD) can easily be measured by Na+ kinetics. In long-term PD, FWT might reflect peritoneal fibrosis, but morphologic or functional relationships have not been investigated. Nonconventional dialysis solutions might be associated with better preservation of peritoneal tissues and function. We developed a long-term peritoneal exposure model in rats with impaired kidney function and investigated peritoneal morphology and function in that model after exposure to conventional and nonconventional solutions.Two studies were reanalyzed. Transport was assessed using a standard peritoneal permeability analysis adapted for the rat. Omental tissue was stained with picro-sirius red (PSR) for uniform quantification of fibrosis. A semiquantitative fibrosis score was also calculated.Rats (n = 9) exposed to a conventional solution for 16 weeks were compared with rats (n = 9) exposed to other solutions. Peritoneal transport parameters were similar, but the degree of fibrosis tended to be more severe in the conventional-solution group. Compared with the situation in humans, the contribution of FWT to ultrafiltration in rats was larger than that of small-pore fluid transport. No correlation between the percentage PSR positivity and FWT was observed. A marked difference in PSR positivity was found between the two studies.The long-term exposure model is not suitable for the study of relationships between FWT and peritoneal fibrosis. Quantitative assessment of the fibrosis is difficult.","30":"Hyper- and hypophosphatemia are recognized risk factors for all-cause mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Recent changes have now focused PD solute clearance targets on urea clearance, rather than on larger solutes, including phosphate. We therefore studied peritoneal phosphate clearance in a cohort of PD patients to determine which factors were clinically relevant.We reviewed results from 451 adult PD patients who were attending for their first assessment of peritoneal membrane function [31.2% treated by continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD); 24.2.%, by automated PD (APD); and 44.6% by APD with a daytime exchange]. Demographics, PD adequacy parameters, peritoneal phosphate clearance, and transport status were reviewed.Of the study patients, 119 (26.4%) were hyperphosphatemic, and 59 (30.1%) were hypophosphatemic; 22.2% were fast transporters. Total daily peritoneal phosphate losses were greater for the hyperphosphatemic than for the hypophosphatemic patients [15 mg\/ dL (range: 10.5-18.6 mg\/dL) vs. 25.7 mg\/dL (range: 15.5-29.8 mg\/dL), p &lt; 0.01], although peritoneal phosphate clearance was less [2.7 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 (range: 1.6-4.1 mL\/min\/1.73 m2) vs. 4.2 mL\/ min\/1.73 m2 (range: 2.1-4.1 mL\/min\/1.73 m2), p &lt; 0.001]. Peritoneal phosphate clearance was greater for faster compared with slower transporters [3.5 mL\/ min\/1.73 m2 (range: 2.5-4.5 mL\/min\/1.73 m2) vs. 1.6 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 (range: 1.1-2.2 mL\/min\/1.73 m2), p &lt; 0.05] and for patients treated either with APD plus a daytime exchange or with CAPD compared with APD alone [3.44 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 (range: 2.3-5.0 mL\/ min\/1.73 m2) vs. 2.9 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 (range: 1.5- 4.4 mL\/min\/1.73 m2) vs. 1.6 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 (range: 1.1-2.4 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, p &lt; 0.001)]. On multivariate analysis, increased peritoneal clearance was associated with faster peritoneal transport status, younger age, lower serum albumin, and lower serum phosphate.Peritoneal phosphate clearance depends not only PD modality, but also patient factors, including peritoneal transport status and variables associated with inflammation.","31":null,"32":"Bullous lesions in patients with end-stage renal disease are uncommon and can pose diagnostic and therapeutic challenges. We present a female patient with end-stage renal disease, bullous skin lesions affecting mainly sun-exposed areas, and high ferritin levels. She also had hepatitis C. Her serum porphyrin panel was suggestive of porphyria cutanea tarda. Skin biopsy excluded inflammatory pathologies. Phlebotomy during each hemodialysis, continuation of darbepoetin, and avoidance of any further doses of intravenous iron, with close monitoring of hemoglobin, resulted in a gradual drop in ferritin level and improvement of the skin lesions.","33":"Calciphylaxis is a major cause of morbidity and mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Intravenous sodium thiosulfate (STS) is the mainstay of therapy for calciphylaxis. In peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with calciphylaxis, intravenous STS poses logistic and financial challenges. Even though pharmacokinetic studies show poor bioavailability of oral STS, we report successful use of oral STS in 2 PD patients with calciphylaxis.A 55-year-old Latina American woman with diabetes was initiated on PD after access failure and chronic hypotension. She developed painful ischemic lesions in the left middle finger and left big toe 4 months later. The ischemia in the left hand progressed, requiring amputation of two fingers. She later developed extensive painful calcific areas in the abdominal wall. She was initially started on oral STS 1500 mg twice daily that was subsequently increased to 3750 mg daily, which resulted in substantial pain relief and a decrease in the size of the calcific plaques.Another diabetic patient with ESRD who was on PD presented with a painful ischemic finger for 2 years. He was treated with oral STS 1500 mg twice daily, resulting in prompt pain relief.Oral STS can be an effective treatment for calciphylaxis.","34":null,"35":null,"36":"Cardiovascular disease is the major cause of morbidity and mortality in chronic kidney disease patients. Because of a higher occurrence of asymptomatic coronary artery disease and increased perioperative cardiovascular mortality in kidney transplant patients, screening for coronary artery disease before transplant surgery is essential. Various studies have shown that cardiac stress testing is an unreliable screening method in these patients because of significant variability in sensitivity and negative predictive value. We suggest that high-risk candidates such as those with diabetes or a prior history of myocardial infarction, stroke, peripheral vascular disease, or coronary artery disease should perhaps be considered for coronary angiography rather than stress testing as cardiac screening before kidney transplantation.","37":null,"38":"Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is an infrequent but serious complication that is observed mostly in patients on long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD). However it can occur after short-term PD, in association with \"second hit\" risk factors such as peritonitis, acute cessation of PD, or kidney transplantation with the use of calcineurin inhibitors.In our case, a young woman with second-hit risk factors presented with clinical and abdominal computed tomography findings consistent with EPS after short-term PD. She was treated conservatively with nutritional support and was discharged in improved and stable clinical status.In general, the diagnosis of EPS requires clinical findings of bowel obstruction combined with typical computed tomography imaging features. However, the clinical manifestations can be very vague, and the diagnosis is often unclear. A recent study categorized EPS into 4 clinical stages, from pre-EPS to chronic ileus, with associated management from conservative treatment to surgical intervention.In association with second-hit risk factors, EPS can occur after short-term PD. Severity is variable, and the outcome is often devastating. Timely recognition and expert management of EPS can change the outcome very favorably.","39":"Infection remains the leading complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Topical mupirocin and gentamicin are frequently used to prevent infections. Mupirocin ointment has been reported to cause damage to both polyurethane and silicone PD catheters. Gentamicin cream has not been associated with physical damage to catheters.A 64-year-old woman on PD developed relapsing peritonitis with Staphylococcus epidermidis. Because of a drainage problem and white discoloration at the exit site, which is known as \" frosting,\" she underwent catheter exchange. The catheter was found to be fractured within the area of frosting. Four more patients with frosting of the catheter were identified. On further questioning, it was recognized that they were applying excessive amounts of gentamicin cream directly on the catheter surface rather than at the exit site. All patients in the program were educated about the correct method of topical antibiotic application. After the change in practice, no further cases of catheter frosting were identified.Polyurethane catheters can undergo oxidation, mineralization, and environmental stress cracking, leading to physical damage such frosting, ballooning, and fracture. Polyethylene glycol, a component of the mupirocin ointment base, is thought to cause plasticization of polyurethane, reducing its tensile strength. Similar damage has been observed in silicone catheters. Previous reports have not found gentamicin cream to cause that type of damage. We observed that excessive amounts of cream applied directly to the catheter surface can damage it. Damage did not recur once patients had been educated about the proper method of application.","40":"Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis (PD) refers to the initiation of PD in new-start end-stage renal disease patients who present either emergently in the hospital or urgently in clinic. These patients are called \"late-referred patients.\" Our academic practice group, like many private practice and academic groups, currently functions within 4 hospitals and 4 clinics. The patient base consists of a large indigent population with limited access to health care and also of insured patients. An urgent-start PD program was initiated to provide all patients with a choice of dialysis modality.Our faculty understood that, for their urgent-start PD program to be successful, they had to have the support of the house staff, hospitalists, surgeons, and the PD nurse. The education began with grand rounds on urgent-start PD in the medicine department. We also educated the hospitalists at the other private hospitals on our urgent-start program. Once the primary care services were comfortable with urgent-start PD, our nephrology group then educated the surgeons about best-practice guidelines for PD catheter placement. At that time, a direct feedback communication loop was created between the PD nurse, surgeon, and nephrologist about the placement and functionality of the catheter. Here, we present our success in the creation of an urgent-start PD program.","41":null,"42":"Rupture of the peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter is rare complication. Here, we report a case of catheter rupture that occurred because of exercise after partial catheter reimplantation.A 66-year-old man with a history of end-stage kidney disease secondary to diabetic nephropathy experienced refractory exit-site and tunnel infection. After the infected parts of the catheter were excised, a partial catheter reimplantation was performed. At the time of that surgery, a presternal location was selected for the new exit site, and a titanium extender was used to connect the two catheters. The patient was discharged on postoperative day 3, but was readmitted for a pericatheter leak 5 days later. Fluoroscopy performed to investigate the cause demonstrated a pericatheter leak from the connecting portion between the titanium extender and the catheter.Surgery performed to repair the leak revealed that the catheter had ruptured. We believe that the cause of the rupture was mechanical stress induced by the patient's stretching exercise program. The PD catheter was made of silicone rubber with high elasticity. Even when such resilient materials are used, we recommend that, to avoid PD catheter rupture after partial reimplantation, clinicians should discourage the patient from stretching excessively.","43":"To investigate whether peritoneal dialysis (PD) is useful as a first modality in Japan, where hemodialysis (HD) is used in 97% of all patients on maintenance dialysis, we used intention-to-treat (ITT) and as-treated analyses to examine patient survival at our center, where HD and PD are used almost equally. In the ITT analysis, survival was significantly better in the PD group than in the HD group (p = 0.009). Meanwhile, the as-treated analysis did not reveal any significant differences in survival between the HD and PD groups. Survival for patients who underwent combined therapy with PD and HD was very good at 93.75% after 4 years, despite a young age of introduction (56 years). Our results confirm the usefulness of PD as an initial modality of maintenance dialysis and indicate that combined therapy can serve as a useful treatment option for dialysis patients.","44":"Unplanned start of dialysis is still a common and important problem for dialysis units in Europe and across the world: 30%-50% of patients can commence therapy in that way. Such patients are known to experience increased morbidity and mortality, to make greater demands on health care resources, and to be less likely to receive their dialysis modality choice. We therefore aimed to meet the specific needs of unplanned-start patients by developing and implementing an Unplanned Start Educational Programme in dialysis units. The new program--which is intended to effectively influence the clinical pathway for patients and to equip health care professionals with the tools necessary to support and optimize the process of unplanned dialysis start--was created with the support of 5 dialysis units and academic experts in patient education. It involves process mapping of patient flows so as to recognize the key steps in the management of unplanned dialysis. Following its successful development, the Unplanned Start Educational Programme was delivered to patients. To evaluate the effectiveness of the program, an observational study, Offering Patients Therapy Options in Unplanned Start, had the primary outcome of measuring the impact of the education program on dialysis modality choice (peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis).","45":null,"46":"Hypotension represents a very serious clinical problem in patients receiving renal replacement therapy, and it is associated with a significant increase in mortality risk. Infants on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) can be particularly prone to chronic hypotension because of the hyponatremic hypovolemia risk related to their primary renal disease, their nutritional needs, and their peritoneal membrane characteristics. In this setting, if an acute clinical event leads to a further decline in systolic blood pressure, the counteract and perfusion pressure autoregulatory mechanisms can both be impaired, leading to severe complications. Anterior ischemic optic neuropathy (AION) represents an acute ischemic disorder of the optic nerve head and a dramatic cause of sudden blindness, whose incidence is about 1% in children on CPD. In recent studies, very young age, autosomal recessive polycystic kidney disease, and sustained hypotension were found to be substantial risk factors for AON. In infants at risk, strategies of long-term treatment and prevention of peritoneal dialysis-induced hypotension should be applied to prevent progression in the pathophysiologic cascade that leads to chronic hypotension and its complications.","47":"Visit-to-visit blood pressure (BP) variability has recently been recognized as an important risk factor for decline of residual kidney function (RKF) in patients with chronic kidney disease. However little is known about the impact of visit-to-visit BP variability on RKF in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. We retrospectively studied the association between RKF and visit-to-visit BP variability in 42 patients who started on PD between February 2006 and March 2012. Residual kidney function was defined as the mean of the urea and creatinine clearances in the patients. Visit-to-visit BP variability was defined as the average real variability of BP measurements taken during 12 consecutive visits after the start of PD. A significant association between the slope of RKF after the start of PD and the visit-to-visit variability of systolic BP was evident (r = -0.353, p = 0.022). On multiple regression analysis, the association was significant (p = 0.024) after adjustments for possible confounders (proteinuria, estimated glomerular filtration rate, and mean systolic BP). Decline in RKF was significantly associated with visit-to-visit BP variability in PD patients. The results suggest that RKF can be better maintained by reducing visit-to-visit BP variability.","48":"The normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) reflects daily dietary protein intake in stable dialysis patients. In peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, reports about the importance of nPCR as marker of nutrition and outcome have been inconsistent. The objective of the present study was to investigate the relationships of nPCR with body composition parameters, micronutrient electrolytes, and long-term survival in PD patients. From November 2000 to May 2008, 57 PD patients were enrolled in the study. On enrollment, demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were recorded. Patients were followed through September 2011. Mean age of the patients was 56 years, and 61% were of African descent. Mean and maximum follow-up were 2.83 years and 11 years respectively. Mean daily nPCR was 0.944 g\/kg. The nPCR correlated directly with albumin (r = 0.34, p = 0.012), magnesium (r = 0.48, p &lt; 0.0001), phosphorus (r = 0.42, p = 0.02), and the phase angle body composition parameter (r = 0.26, p = 0.049). Compared with patients whose enrollment daily nPCR was less than 0.8 g\/kg, those with an enrollment daily nPCR of 0.8 g\/kg or more experienced significantly better 11-year cumulative survival (p = 0.04). In multivariate Cox regression analysis with adjustment for confounding variables, nPCR was an independent predictor of all-cause mortality (p = 0.018). In conclusion, lower nPCR is associated with poorer nutrition status and increased risk of all-cause mortality in PD patients followed for up to 11 years.","49":null,"50":null,"51":"Previously, we reported that, in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, tolvaptan preserves residual renal function and ameliorates left ventricular hypertrophy. Here, we evaluated the effect of tolvaptan in terms of nutrition and inflammatory states. Of 24 incident PD patients with diabetes, 12 were assigned to a control group that did not receive tolvaptan, and 12, to a group that, 2 weeks after initiation of PD, received tolvaptan 15 mg daily for 12 months. At baseline and at 6 and 12 months after initiation of PD, we evaluated serum C-reactive protein (CRP), albumin, urine volume, peritoneal ultrafiltration (UF), phosphate elimination, protein uptake, left ventricular mass index (LVMI), and the diameter of the inferior vena cava (IVC). Compared with the control group, the tolvaptan group experienced preserved urine volume and UF, lower LVMI and IVC diameter, and higher protein uptake. The average protein uptake was significantly correlated with urine volume, albumin, and CRP; and serum CRP was significantly correlated with albumin. Our study results suggest that tolvaptan improves not only fluid management, but also nutrition state in PD patients.","52":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) utilization varies across countries, and of the factors that explain the variation, the scientific and clinical knowledge of health care professionals is potentially important. In this paper, we describe a European collaboration--between 8 academic PD research programs, a small-to-medium-sized enterprise, and a large PD product manufacturer--that received significant research funding from the EU commission to establish a training network. European Training and Research in Peritoneal Dialysis (EuTRiPD) is providing training to 12 PhD students who have moved within the European Union and are completing research training. The underlying structure and processes within EuTRiPD (http:\/\/www.eutripd. eu) are described, and the benefits of the collaborative approach are discussed. This model could be useful to other research groups and will assist in maintaining and growing scientific expertise in PD research.","53":"Increased lymphatic absorption might contribute to ultrafiltration failure in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Lymphangiogenesis develops during PD, but little is known about the relationship between its morphologic and functional parameters. The relationships between lymph vessel density, the effective lymphatic absorption rate (ELAR), and fibrosis were investigated in a rat model of chronic kidney failure (CKD) with exposure to dialysis solutions. Wistar rats (n = 44) were allocated to these groups: NKF (normal kidney function), CKD (70% nephrectomy), CKDD [CKD, with daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) Dianeal 3.86% (Baxter Healthcare BV, Utrecht, Netherlands)], CKDP [CKD, with daily i.p. Physioneal 3.86% (Baxter Healthcare BV)]. After 16 weeks, a peritoneal function test was performed, and the ELAR was calculated from the disappearance rate of i.p. dextran 70. The lymph vessel profile density (LVPD) was assessed using STEPanizer image analysis (Java application from Tschanz SA, Bern, Germany) of omental sections after anti-podoplanin immunostaining. Fibrosis was quantified by picro-sirius red staining. The LVPD was significantly increased in CKD rats compared with NKF rats, and no additional effect of dialysis solutions was present. The ELAR was increased in uremic rats compared with NKF rats. For all rats together, the LVPD correlated positively with the ELAR and with the amount of fibrosis. Chronic kidney disease itself induces lymphangiogenesis and fibrosis and increases the ELAR, independent of exposure to dialysis fluids. The ELAR is related to the LVPD in peritoneal tissue.","54":"In Japan, peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter insertion has been performed by both nephrologists and surgeons. However, nephrologists have fewer opportunities to train in the insertion procedure. We therefore used a PD access simulator to provide training in this operative technique for nephrologists. A PD access simulator developed by Terumo Medical Corporation was used for the training. The simulator uses a mannequin made of acrylic resin. The abdominal wall of a pig is attached to the abdominal area, and a plastic bag represents the abdominal cavity. The simulator enables the surgical procedure to be performed from skin incision to PD catheter insertion. Between October 2011 and December 2013, 3 supervising doctors used the simulator to guide 17 nephrologists with no experience through a PD catheter insertion. One-on-one training was provided in a single 2- or 3-hour session. In a questionnaire survey after the training, trainees gave high marks to the handling of surgical instruments, the environment of the operating room, and the surgical guidance during training. However, the supervising doctors required the ability to respond flexibly, because trainees had individual differences in skills. The PD access simulator might be useful for providing guided training in operative technique for PD catheter insertion.","55":null,"56":null,"57":"Hyaluronan (HA) is widely spread in the body and is an important component of the extracellular matrix, including the endothelial glycocalyx (EG). Essential for its vasculoprotective function, HA is involved in vascular permeability and many other processes. In patients with kidney disease, plasma HA is higher than expected, but the extent to which plasma HA and its degrading enzyme hyaluronidase can be used as markers for the state of the EG has not yet been determined. In the first part of this review, we describe HA synthesis and degradation; we then focus on the involvement of the kidney in the process. In the second part, we summarize the available data on HA and hyaluronidase in patients with kidney failure. Plasma HA is somewhat elevated in kidney failure and predicts for poor survival in dialysis patients. The increased HA levels in kidney failure are probably a result of decreased excretion, but an upregulated turnover cannot be ruled out with certainty in some patients. Hyaluronan might be involved in the regulation of peritoneal transport in PD.","58":"The use of interactive video has been recognized as a means of delivering medical support to isolated areas since the 1950s. The Department of Defense recognized early the capacity of telemedicine to deliver medical care and support to front-line military personnel. In 1989, the Texas Telemedicine Project received grants and support from the then American Telephone and Telegraph Company (now AT&amp;T) and the Meadows Foundation of Dallas, Texas, to establish and evaluate telemedicine delivery in central Texas. That project had 6 connected telemedicine sites: 3 in Austin, Texas, and 3 in Giddings, Texas (a small community 55 miles to the southeast of Austin). The sites in Giddings included a chronic outpatient dialysis facility, an inpatient psychiatric hospital, and the emergency department at Giddings Hospital. Patient contact began in April 1991 and continued through March 1993. During that period, data on the 1500 patient contacts made were recorded. After termination of the Texas Telemedicine Project, AT&amp;T continued to provide the transmission lines, and between 1993 and 1996, another 12,000 patient contacts were made. Approximately 80% were dialysis evaluations and 20% were non-dialysis primary care contacts. The original cost of materials and equipment in the Texas Telemedicine Project exceeded $50,000 per site. Today, a secure Internet connection with full-motion video and wireless data transfer to almost any location in the world is achievable with an iPad. Multiple inexpensive applications with connections for electrocardiogram, otoscope, and stethoscope, among others, make this technology extremely inexpensive and user-friendly. The revolution now is rapidly moving forward, with Medicare reimbursing telemedicine contacts in medically underserved areas. Multiple bills are before Congress to expand Medicare and therefore private insurance payment for this service.","59":"Fournier gangrene (FG), a form of necrotizing fasciitis of the perineum and genitals, with high morbidity and mortality in the general population, carries the additional risk of involvement of the peritoneal catheter tunnel and peritoneal cavity in patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD). We describe two men with diabetes who developed FG in the course of PD. Computed tomography showed no extension of FG to the abdominal wall, and spent peritoneal dialysate was clear in both patients. Broad-spectrum antibiotic therapy with anaerobic coverage and early aggressive debridement followed by negative-pressure wound therapy and repeated debridement led to improvements in clinical status in both cases. Surgical closure and healing of the wound was achieved in one patient; the wound of the second patient is healing, but remains open. Both patients experienced prolonged hospitalization, with a serious decline in nutrition status. In patients on PD, FG can be treated successfully. However, additional measures are required to evaluate for potential involvement of the PD apparatus and the peritoneal cavity in the infectious process; and prolonged hospitalization, worsening nutrition, and multiple surgical interventions can result.","60":"Diuretics are commonly prescribed to manage various conditions in the general population. They can continue to play a role in dialysis patients to manage extracellular fluid volume and hypertension and to reduce the tendency to hyperkalemia. Nevertheless, diuretics are often stopped when patients commence dialysis. Several studies have shown that preserved residual renal function in dialysis patients is associated with improved patient survival. Although the association between diuretic use and preserved residual renal function is still controversial, the numerous clinical benefits offered by diuretics render those agents valuable in dialysis patients with urine output. Loop diuretics are generally the agents of choice in end-stage renal disease. They need to be used at higher doses because of pharmacokinetic changes in the context of diminishing renal clearance. Other classes of diuretics can still be used in end-stage renal disease, but usually in conjunction with loop diuretics or for benefits independent of diuresis. Complications can occur with the use of diuretics, but are avoidable with appropriate use. Dose-related ototoxicity, especially with concomitant use of other ototoxic medications, can occur. Hyperkalemia is possible with the use of potassium-sparing diuretics, but studies suggest that these agents can be safely administered with close monitoring.","61":"Urea clearance (Kt\/V urea), adjusted for total body water (TBW) using the Watson formula (TBW(Watson)), is widely used to guide peritoneal dialysis (PD) prescription and to ensure dialysis adequacy. The impact of body composition on the determination of TBW(Watson) is well established, but the effect of hydration and nutrition status on TBW(Watson) is not understood. We therefore studied the effects of hydration and nutrition status on TBW(Watson) in PD patients. Our study enrolled 195 PD patients and 33 healthy control subjects. Multiple-frequency bioelectrical impedance spectroscopy (MF-BIS) was used to measure TBW and the result was compared with TBW(Watson). Patients were divided into three groups according to their degree of overhydration [deltahydration status (OH) in liters]: normally hydrated group (OH: &lt; 2.0 L), mildly overhydrated group (OH: 2.0 - 4.0 L), and severely overhydrated group (OH: &gt; 4.0 L). Compared with MF-BIS, the Watson formula overestimated TBW in normally hydrated patients, but underestimated TBW in severely overhydrated patients. In addition, of the normally hydrated patients, 22 were malnourished by subjective global assessment, and the TBW(Watson) overestimation was much greater in them than in the well-nourished patients. Our study suggests that hydration and nutrition status both strongly affect TBW(Watson) in PD patients.","62":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions dilate microvessels by undefined mechanisms. This vasodilation directly affects ultrafiltration and solute exchange during a PD dwell and is thought to account for the variable mass transfer area coefficient for small solutes during a glucose-based hypertonic dwell. We hypothesized that PD-mediated vasodilation occurs by endothelium-dependent mechanisms that involve endothelium energy-dependent K+ channels (K(ATP)), adenosine A1 receptor activation, and NO release. We used intravital videomicroscopy to study 3 levels of microvessels (A1 inflow arterioles about 100 microm diameter to pre-capillary A3 arterioles 10 - 15 microm diameter) in the terminal ileum of anesthetized rats under control conditions in vivo in a tissue bath. Ileum was bathed with hypertonic mannitol or 2.5% glucose-based PD solution (Delflex: Fresenius Medical Care North America, Waltham, MA, U.S.A.) with or without topical application of individual or combined specific inhibitors of the endothelium-dependent dilation pathways.: NO (L-NMMA), prostaglandin I2 (mefenamic acid), endothelium hyperpolarizing factor (glibenclamide), and adenosine A1 receptor antagonist (DPCPX). The mannitol and PD solutions induced rapid and sustained peritoneal vasodilation whose magnitude depended on microvascular level and osmotic solute. Combined inhibition of endothelium-dependent dilation pathways completely abolished the mannitol-induced hyperosmolality-mediated dilation at all microvascular levels, but selectively eliminated the PD solution-mediated A3 dilation. The K(ATP) and adenosine receptor antagonists, individually or combined, remarkably attenuated dilation in the smaller pre-capillary arterioles; NO inhibition, alone or combined with K(ATP) and adenosine receptor antagonists, eliminated the PD solution-induced dilation. The cyclooxygenase pathway is not involved in PD-induced dilation. Solutions for PD dilate the visceral peritoneal microvasculature by endothelium-dependent mechanisms, primarily the NO pathway. Adenosine receptor-activated NO release and K(ATP) channel-mediated endothelium hyperpolarization significantly contribute to vasodilation in the smaller peritoneal pre-capillary arterioles.","63":"Conventional automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) is prescribed as a repetition of the same dwell time and the same fill volume delivered by the cycler during the dialysis session. Nevertheless, it is well recognized that a cycle with a short dwell time and a small fill volume favors ultrafiltration (UF), while a cycle with a long dwell time and a large fill volume favors uremic toxin removal. The use of varied dwell times and dwell volumes, called adapted APD, allows for an optimized peritoneal dialysis prescription with better volume control--that is, both an increased UF volume at a lower metabolic cost [UF per gram of glucose absorbed (mL\/g)] and increased dialytic sodium removal resulting in improved removal of uremic toxins (urea, creatinine, phosphate) during dialysis.","64":"We previously reported that lower serum magnesium is associated with poorer nutrition status, impaired cellular health, and increased inflammation in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The present study was designed to investigate the prognostic value of serum magnesium for mortality in PD patients. From November 2000 to July 2008, the study enrolled 62 patients, recording their demographic, clinical, and biochemical data. Patients were followed to September 2011. Mean age of the patients was 55 +\/- 16 years, and in this cohort, 55% were women, 63% were African American, and 25% had diabetes. Mean serum magnesium was 1.597 +\/- 0.28 mEq\/L. Maximum follow-up was 10.8 years. During the follow-up period, 27 patients died (43.5%). Serum magnesium was significantly higher in the patients who survived than in those who did not (1.757 mEq\/L vs. 1.515 mEq\/L, p = 0.04). Patients were then stratified by enrollment magnesium. After 10.8 years of observation, cumulative survival was significantly better in patients with an enrollment serum magnesium greater than 1.6 mEq\/L than in patients with an enrollment serum magnesium of 1.6 mEq\/L or less (p = 0.04). Multivariate Cox regression analysis revealed that serum magnesium is a significant predictor of mortality (relative risk: 0.984; p = 0.048) after adjusting for age, race, sex, diabetes, and months on dialysis at enrollment. In conclusion, lower serum magnesium is a significant predictor of higher mortality in PD patients. Factors affecting the serum magnesium concentration in PD patients should be investigated in more detail.","65":"In recent years, icodextrin 7.5% has been used in PD as an alternative to glucose to achieve sustained reliable ultrafiltration (UF) and clearance without adversely increasing glucose absorption. Icodextrin is generally well tolerated. The most commonly reported adverse events are cutaneous reactions. We report a rare form of hypersensitivity to icodextrin 7.5% that was accompanied by dyspnea and symptomatic hypotension, without increased UF to account for the observed hypotension. Icodextrin produces symptomatic hypotension in up to 40% of patients by a known mechanism of increased UF and corresponding weight loss. However, it can also produce symptomatic hypotension accompanied by several other systemic symptoms in a hypersensitivity reaction. Discontinuation of the icodextrin results in prompt resolution of those symptoms. Treating nephrologists must be aware of this rare form of icodextrin hypersensitivity.","66":"Approximately 10% - 20% of adult kidney transplant recipients and as many as 40% of pediatric recipients receive peritoneal dialysis (PD) before kidney transplantation. An important aspect of perioperative kidney transplant care is management of the PD catheter. Peritoneal dialysis can be performed immediately after transplantation for delayed graft function (DGF), which can occur with as many as 20% of deceased-donor kidney grafts, especially when expanded criteria or organs from donation after cardiac death are used. However, leaving the PD catheter in place has been associated with an increased risk for infections such as peritonitis and exit-site infection, even when the catheter is not used. Although no consensus has been reached about the management of PD catheters after kidney transplantation, transplant centers should have a low threshold for PD catheter removal at the time of surgery, especially in recipients with a low risk for DGF. In individuals with high risk for DGF the PD catheter can be left in place, but it must be removed in a timely manner once it is no longer needed.","67":"A recent study indicated that, compared with glycated hemoglobin (HbA1c), glycated albumin (GA) provides a more accurate assessment of glycemic control in diabetic patients on hemodialysis. However, the suitability of GA for this purpose in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients is questionable. We measured blood glucose, GA, HbA1c, serum albumin, protein losses in urine and dialysate, protein catabolic rate, hemoglobin, and dose of erythropoiesis-stimulating agents in 71 PD patients [20 with diabetes (DM), 51 without DM]. In both DM and non-DM patients, blood glucose levels correlated significantly with HbA1c (r = 0.47, p &lt; 0.001), but not with GA (r = 0.18, p = 0.19). In patients with high serum albumin (&gt; 3.2 g\/dL), blood glucose levels correlated significantly with GA (r = 0.32, p = 0.047). Further, low protein losses in urine and dialysate (&lt; 5.9 g daily) also significantly correlated with GA (r = 0.37, p = 0.041). In PD patients, HbA1c is better than GA as an indicator of blood glucose levels. Glycated albumin can be used as an indicator of glycemic control in PD patients with normal serum albumin and low protein losses in urine and dialysate.","68":"Glucose-based peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions dilate the parietal and visceral peritoneal microvasculature by endothelium-dependent mechanisms that primarily involve hyperosmolality. This PD-mediated dilation occurs by active intracellular glucose uptake and adenosine Al receptor activation, and by hyperosmolality-stimulated glibenclamide-sensitive potassium channels. Both pathways invoke NO as a second messenger for vasodilation. We hypothesized that during crystalloid-induced osmosis, the osmotic water flux through the transendothelial water-exclusive aquaporin 1 (AQP1) channels is the primary mechanism whereby the endothelium is being stimulated to instigate hyperosmolality-driven vasodilation. Four microvascular levels (diameters in the range 6 - 100 microm) were visualized by intravital videomicroscopy of the terminal ileum in anesthetized rats. Microvascular diameters and flow were measured after topical exposure to a 5% hypertonic mannitol or 2.5% glucose-based PD solution, at baseline and after brief tissue pre-treatment (with 0.1% glutaraldehyde for 10 seconds) or after combined tissue pre-treatment and pharmacologic blockade of AQP1 with HgCl2 (100 micromol\/L). Vascular endothelial integrity was verified by the response to acetylcholine (10(-4) mol\/L) and sodium nitroprusside (10(-4) mol\/L). The hyperosmolar solutions both caused rapid and sustained vasodilation at all microvascular levels, which was not altered by tissue pre-treatment. Inhibition of AQP1 completely abolished the mannitol-induced vasodilation and markedly attenuated the PD fluid-mediated vasodilation. Neither glutaraldehyde pre-treatment nor HgCl2 affected tissue integrity or endothelial cell function. We conclude that the peritoneal microvascular vasodilation caused by hyperosmolar PD fluid is instigated by the osmotic water flux through AQP1. Clinical PD solutions have components other than hyperosmolality that can induce endothelium-dependent peritoneal microvascular vasodilation independent of the AQP1-mediated osmosis.","69":"Peritonitis remains a leading complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). About 18% of the infection-related mortality in PD patients is a result of peritonitis. We present a case of peritonitis in a patient on automated PD in whom the infection was not related to a break in PD technique, but to an unusual cause: retrograde transmission of a gonococcal organism.","70":"Exaggerated postprandial increase in blood glucose has been postulated to be associated with cardiovascular injury. The concentration of blood glucose is altered by glucose absorption from peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids. In PD patients, we used continuous blood glucose monitoring (CGM) to analyze diurnal variations in blood glucose. Diurnal blood glucose was determined in 10 diabetic PD patients who used CGM (iPro2: Medtronic, Northridge, CA, U.S.A.) for 3 days. Blood glucose concentrations before and after glycemic control were monitored in 5 patients. Correlations between CGM parameters [standard deviation of blood glucose (SDG)], peritoneal function [dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creatinine (D\/P Cr) and end-to-initial dialysate (D\/D0) glucose], 24-hour peritoneal glucose absorption, and glycemic index were determined. In 5 patients, CGM was performed again after adjustments to antidiabetic drugs. A large diurnal variation, especially at night, was observed in this patient cohort. No correlation of HbA1c with mean blood glucose concentration was observed. Although SDG had no association with 24-hour peritoneal glucose absorption, it did show an association with D\/P Cr and D\/D0 glucose. The SDG was significantly lower after treatment with a dipeptidyl peptidase IV inhibitor or an increase in insulin dose. Results of the present study indicate that diurnal variations in glucose depend on the speed of peritoneal glucose absorption rather than the net glucose absorption.","71":"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) experience serious adverse cardiovascular (CV) consequences. Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of morbidity and mortality in patients with CKD, being secondary not only to an increased prevalence of traditional CV risk factors, but also to the presence of a wide array of nontraditional risk factors unique to patients with CKD. Pathogenesis includes both functional and structural alterations in the CV system. Those alterations give rise to a wide range of clinical CV syndromes, including ischemic heart disease, heart failure, and sudden cardiac arrest. As an increasingly prevalent disease, CKD, together with consequent CV disease, imparts major health and economic burdens to the community. In this review, we discuss traditional and nontraditional risk factors for CV disease, the pathogenesis of CV clinical syndromes, and prevention of CV syndromes in patients with CKD.","72":"In the United States, interest has recently been renewed in the more urgent initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) to avoid temporary vascular access catheters in appropriate patients presenting late in the course of their kidney disease. Urgent-start PD programs have been established across the country, requiring new infrastructure and processes of care. Less is known about early technique success after urgent initiation of PD. In this report, we describe 90-day technique success and causes of hospitalization in 81 patients initiating PD in our urgent-start pathway.","73":"Recently, it was reported that concomitant hemodialysis (HD) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients facilitated continuation of PD treatment and mitigated the deterioration of peritoneal function in patients with uremic symptoms and excess body fluid associated with loss of residual renal function. To determine the effect of combined HD and PD on patient and technique survival, we undertook a retrospective cohort study of patients who underwent PD at Saitama Medical University Hospital between 1995 and 2010. We compared patients who started PD during 1995 2002 with those who started during 2003- 2010. Because our center started a new strategy of supplementing PD with once-weekly HD in 2000, the effects of combination therapy could be determined by comparing the data obtained during the two periods. The 440 patients (274 men, 166 women) who started PD during the study period had a mean age of 60.2 +\/- 73 years. The mean age was significantly higher in the 2003 - 2010 group than in the 1995 - 2002 group. Using a Kaplan-Meier plot, we observed a significant difference in technique survival (p &lt; 0.001). The technique survival rate at 3 and 5 years was, respectively, 89% and 74% in the 2003-2010 group and 68% and 35% in the 1995 - 2002 group (p &lt; 0.05). Cumulative patient survival at 3 and 5 years was, respectively, 87% and 72% in the 2003 - 2010 group and 69% and 51% in the 1995 - 2003 group (p &lt; 0.01). Patient and technique survival were significantly improved in PD patients receiving the combination of HD and PD.","74":"Studies have shown that a single-item question might be useful in identifying patients with limited health literacy. However, the utility of the approach has not been studied in patients receiving maintenance peritoneal dialysis (PD). We assessed health literacy in a cohort of 31 PD patients by administering the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) and a single-item health literacy (SHL) screening question \"How confident are you filling out medical forms by yourself?\" (Extremely, Quite a bit, Somewhat, A little bit, or Not at all). To determine the accuracy of the single-item question for detecting limited health literacy, we performed sensitivity and specificity analyses of the SHL and plotted the area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC) curve using the REALM as a reference standard. Using a cut-off of \"Somewhat\" or less confident, the sensitivity of the SHL for detecting limited health literacy was 80%, and the specificity was 88%. The positive likelihood ratio was 6.9. The SHL had an AUROC of 0.79 (95% confidence interval: 0.52 to 1.00). Our results show that the SHL could be effective in detecting limited health literacy in PD patients.","75":"Qualitative assessments in long-term patients and in those with encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) have shown that impaired osmotic conductance is likely a factor contributing to the presence of ultrafiltration failure in those individuals. In the present study, we investigated the value of osmotic conductance, its components LpA and the reflection coefficient sigma, and free water transport (FWT) in 12 patients with EPS, in 21 patients with long-term ultrafiltration failure, and in 26 time-restricted control subjects with normal ultrafiltration. A decrease in all parameters was observed during a period of 4 years in patients with EPS and ultrafiltration failure, with FWT showing the largest difference between all three groups; however, the receiver operating curves showed that only FWT appeared to be a significant predictor of EPS. Because its measurement is simple, FWT should be included in the regular assessment of peritoneal function.","76":"The aim of the present study was to assess the influence of peritoneal permeability expressed as the dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creatinine (D\/P Cr) on total and cardiovascular (CV) mortality in a population of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients during a 6-year observation period. The study recruited 55 patients (mean age: 53 years) treated with PD for a median of 24 months. Hematology parameters and serum albumin were determined using routine methods. Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha) and transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta1) were determined by high-sensitivity ELISA. Peritoneal transport characteristics were identified using D\/P Cr reference values after a peritoneal equilibration test. During the 6-year observation period, 22 patients (40%) died, mostly from CV complications (77% of deaths). In multiple Cox regression, D\/P Cr and dialysate volume at PD initiation predicted total [hazard ratio (HR): 1.57; p = 0.02; and HR: 1.20; p = 0.04 respectively] and CV mortality (HR: 1.65; p = 0.02; and HR: 1.23; p = 0.05 respectively) independent of age, dialysis therapy duration, serum albumin concentration, dialysis adequacy measures, TGF-beta1, and TNF-alpha. Additionally, TNF-alpha was independently associated with all-cause and CV mortality, and albumin, with all-cause mortality. Baseline D\/P Cr was a strong independent marker of survival in PD patients. Baseline D\/P Cr and dialysate volume were independent risk factors for total and CV mortality in the PD population and could be significant for assessing CV risk in this population.","77":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter-related infection is still is the most troublesome problem for continuation of PD without the need to switch to hemodialysis. We have been performing subcutaneous pathway diversion (SPD) as a surgical treatment for refractory exit-site and tunnel infection (ESTI). To clarify the efficacy and safety of SPD, we conducted a retrospective study. From August 2008 to August 2013, 30 SPDs were performed in 26 patients (16 men, 10 women; mean age: 58 +\/- 13 years; 54% with diabetes; mean body mass index: 23.9 +\/- 3.5 kg\/ m2). The reasons for the SPDs were ESTI in 25 patients, and outer cuff extrusion in 1 patient. All patients resumed PD immediately after SPD, and the duration of hospitalization was 11.7 +\/- 10.1 days. After SPD, one patient experienced a dialysate leak, and another patient experienced a mild subcutaneous hematoma. Another 4 patients developed exit-site infection (ESI) and underwent a second SPD. Of those 4 patients, 3 presented with another ESI unrelated to the first episode, and all developed an ESI after 6 months or more. The remaining 20 patients experienced no such complications. Furthermore, catheter survival after SPD was 17.4 +\/- 13.4 months. To eradicate ESTTI we suggest that SPD, which does not require catheter removal or interruption of PD, is useful compared with the unroofing technique or catheter removal.","78":"There is increasing evidence that long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) is associated with structural changes in the peritoneal membrane. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin system has been demonstrated to lessen peritoneal injury and to slow the decline in residual renal function. Whether spironolactone affects residual renal function in addition to the peritoneal membrane is unknown. We evaluated 23 patients (13 women) with a glomerular filtration rate of 2 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 or more who were receiving PD. Patients with an active infection or peritonitis episode were excluded. Baseline measurements were obtained for serum high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), and connective tissue growth factor (CTGF); for daily ultrafiltration (in milliliters); for end-to-initial dialysate concentration of glucose (4\/D0 glucose), Kt\/V, and peritoneal transport status; and for dialysate cancer antigen 125 (CA125). Spironolactone therapy (25 mg) was given daily for 6 months, after which all measurements were repeated. Mean age of the patients was 46 +\/- 13 years. Duration of PD was 15 +\/- 21 months (range: 2-88 months). After spironolactone therapy, mean dialysate CA125 was significantly increased compared with baseline (20.52 +\/- 12.06 U\/mL vs. 24.44 +\/- 13.97 U\/mL, p = 0.028). Serum hs-CRP, VEGF, TGF-beta, CTGF, daily ultrafiltration, D\/Do glucose, Kt\/V and peritoneal transport status were similar at both times. At the end of the study period, residual glomerular filtration rate in the patients was lower. In PD patients, treatment with spironolactone seems to slow the decline of peritoneal function, suppress the elevation of profibrotic markers, and increase mesothelial cell mass.","79":"Nondialytic therapy (NDT)--also calledconservative kidney management--is a growing modality of treatment for select chronic kidney disease and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients globally. Nevertheless, NDT is rarely practiced in the United States. We set out to investigate NDT activity before initiation of renal replacement therapy in a Northwestern Wisconsin Mayo Clinic ESRD population. Records of all prevalent ESRD patients on chronic hemodialysis in our practice were retrospectively reviewed in May 2012. Dialysis nurses and social workers were informally interviewed to augment the review process. Of the 166 ESRD patients reviewed, 82 (49%) were 70 years of age or older, 46 (28%) were 70-79 years, and 36 (22%) were 80-89 years. Most of these older patients had multiple significant comorbidities (\"multimorbidity\"). Evidence for NDT activity before initiation of renal replacement therapy was virtually nonexistent. The older ESRD patients with multimorbidity experienced frequent hospitalizations. Our preliminary review suggests that their quality of life may have been better with NDT. Almost one half of our ESRD population was made up of people more than 70 years of age, most with multimorbidity. In our practice, NDT is a neglected paradigm, as it is in most U.S. nephrology practices. The place of NDT, actively provided by a specialized multidisciplinary team, for U.S. ESRD patients demands urgent attention and robust reappraisal by U.S. nephrologists.","80":"Hemoperitoneum in peritoneal dialysis patients is a known but infrequent complication. Hemoperitoneum is more frequent in women because of its association with a variety of gynecologic presentations such as reflux menstruation, ovulation, endometrial tissue implants within the peritoneal cavity (endometriosis), and bleeding follicular cysts. Other intraperitoneal causes of hemoperitoneum include minor catheter or abdominal trauma, vascular anomalies, or hepatic or splenic cysts. Less frequently encountered is a presentation of hemoperitoneum from a retroperitoneal source. These presentations result either from peritoneal inflammation and subsequent peritoneal bleeding or retroperitoneal cavity pathology rupturing into the peritoneal cavity. Here, we present the case of a peritoneal dialysis patient presenting with hemoperitoneum several days after undergoing cardiac catheterization. The catheterization was complicated by a large retroperitoneal hematoma. Details of the case are reported, and other retroperitoneal causes of hemoperitoneum are reviewed.","81":"Cardiovascular mortality remains the commonest cause of death for peritoneal dialysis patients. As such, preventing persistent hypervolemia is important. On the other hand, hypovolemia may potentially risk episodes of acute kidney injury and loss of residual renal function, a major determinant of peritoneal dialysis technique survival. Bioimpedance has developed from a single-frequency research tool to a multi-frequency bioelectrical impedance analysis readily available in the clinic and capable of measuring extracellular, intracellular, and total body water. Similarly, natriuretic peptides released from the heart because of myocardial stretch and increased intracardiac volume have also been variously reported to be helpful in assessing volume status in peritoneal dialysis patients. The question then arises whether these newer technologies and biomarkers have supplanted the time-honored clinical assessment of hydration status or whether they are merely adjuncts that aid the experienced clinician.","82":"Elevated levels of serum alkaline phosphatase (AlkPhos) have been reported to be associated with increased mortality risk in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We examined the association of serum AlkPhos with all-cause mortality in our PD patients. The study enrolled 90 PD patients beginning in 1995. On enrollment, demographics and clinical and biochemical data were recorded. Patients were followed to September 2011. Mean age of the enrollees was 52 years, with 61% being women, and most (81%) being of African descent. Mean and median AlkPhos were 135 U\/L and 113 U\/L respectively. Mean and maximum follow-up were 2.61 and 16 years respectively. As expected, AlkPhos correlated directly with serum intact parathyroid hormone (r = 0.36, p = 0.003). In a Cox multivariate regression analysis with adjustment for confounding variables, AlkPhos as a continuous (relative risk: 1.016; p = 0.004) anda categorical variable [&gt; 120 U\/L and &lt; or = 120 U\/L (relative risk: 6.0; p = 0.03)] remained a significant independent predictor of mortality. For each unit increase in enrollment AlkPhos, there was a 1.6% increase in the relative risk of death. Elevated serum AlkPhos is significantly and independently associated with increased mortality risk in our PD patients followed for up to 16 years. AlkPhos should be evaluated prospectively as a potential therapeutic target in clinical practice.","83":"Clinicians caring for patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) have relied on a variety of laboratory measures to assess the health of patients and their response to treatment. Traditionally, serum albumin has been an indicator of nutrition status and has therefore been included in monthly blood testing in most centers. The development of hypoalbuminemia in dialysis patients has been associated with increased mortality and often leads to interventions such as trials of nutritional supplements. In PD, hypoalbuminemia combined with ongoing losses of protein into effluent raise particular concerns with clinicians. Serum albumin may be affected by a variety of non-nutrition factors such as inflammation, volume status, and comorbidities. Albumin synthesis in the liver exceeds, in most cases, albumin losses in urine or effluent. Interpreting the medical implications of declining serum albumin in PD patients can therefore be a challenge. This paper reviews protein balance in PD. The nutritional and non-nutritional factors affecting serum albumin are discussed, with specific emphasis on how membrane physiology contributes to dialysate protein losses. A general clinical approach to the PD patient developing hypoalbuminemia is discussed.","84":"Compared with other European and North American countries, the United Kingdom traditionally had proportionally more dialysis patients treated by peritoneal dialysis. However as in many economically developed countries, peritoneal dialysis numbers have fallen in the United Kingdom, particularly since the early 2000s. In an effort to increase home-based dialysis therapies, the U.K. Department of Health introduced a new system of reimbursement tariffs favoring peritoneal dialysis and home hemodialysis compared with standard hospital-based hemodialysis. Here, we report how our own center responded to the impending change in reimbursement rates and turned what had been a declining peritoneal dialysis program into one that almost doubled in size within 3 years.","85":"The present study was undertaken to examine the experience of younger dialysis patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) care. Structured tape-recorded interviews focusing on perceptions of ESRD care and how that care could be improved were initially conducted with 25 dialysis patients [16 on conventional hemodialysis (HD), 6 on nocturnal in-center HD, 2 on home peritoneal dialysis (PD), and 1 on home HD]. The mean age of the patients was 43.8 +\/- 12.2 years, and their mean dialysis duration was 4.6 +\/- 3. Oyears. Five important domains were identified from the interviews. Based on those findings, a questionnaire was developed and distributed to 62 ESRD patients (49 on HD, 13 on PD). Several domains were identified that provide insight into how the patients thought their care could be improved. Our results suggest that certain changes in ESRD care might improve the experience of younger dialysis patients.","86":"The proportion of elderly people requiring renal replacement therapy has been increasing in Japan. Although several studies have shown the benefits of peritoneal dialysis (PD) in the elderly, few have reported on outcomes, including prognosis, in elderly PD patients, especially those more than 80 years of age. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate clinical outcomes in elderly (more than 80 years of age) PD patients. We retrospectively evaluated the medical records of elderly PD patients who commenced PD between 2007 and 2011. The frequency of perioperative complications, rate of PD-associated peritonitis, technique survival, overall survival, and utilization of nursing-care insurance systems were investigated as clinical outcomes. The 12 patients eligible for this study (7 men, 5 women; mean age: 85 +\/- 3 years) had a median duration of follow-up of 1.2 years (interquartile range: 0.65-1.74 years). Perioperative complications were not observed in any of the patients. The frequency of PD-associated peritonitis was 1 episode in 56 months. During follow-up, 6 patients died, and 3 patients switched to hemodialysis because of tunnel infection or lack of family support. The overall survival rate at 12 months was 83%. Nursing-care insurance was used by 63% of patients. In elderly patients, it is important to predict the potential short-term issues at the initiation of PD to facilitate implementation of social services, such as home-visit nursing-care services, at the time of worsening general condition.","87":"The case documented here represents the longest course of continuous-flow peritoneal dialysis (PD) reported in the literature. A 61-year-old man with hepatorenal syndrome type 1 and ascites presented with hypotension and bright red blood per rectum and was found to be in acute renal failure with severe anemia. Continuous-flow PD was initiated, and the patient improved clinically. The patient died of a jejunal bleed 8 months later, before discharge. Acute PD or continuous-flow PD is a viable alternative in the setting of hemodynamic instability and ascites, can be used as a chronic modality, and addresses many of the weaknesses of continuous ambulatory and automated PD.","88":"The V2 receptor antagonist tolvaptan has been approved for volume control in heart-failure patients in Japan. Tolvaptan increases renal blood flow, and so the present study was designed to ascertain whether tolvaptan could be a useful diuretic for volume control without reducing residual renal function (RRF) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Tolvaptan was administered in 15 PD patients (15 mg daily). Urine volume, body weight, and blood pressure were monitored Urinary excretion of urea nitrogen Na+, the osmolality of plasma and urine, and peritoneal and renal Kt\/V were analyzed before and after tolvaptan treatment. In 11 of 15 patients, urine volume increased to more than 400 mL daily. A significant increase in diluted urine was observed, as indicated by a reduction in the specific gravity or osmolality of urine (or both). Urinary excretion of urea nitrogen, and Na+ was significantly increased Increases in renal Kt\/V were observed, but peritoneal Kt\/V was unchanged. Singnificant increase in creatinine clearance was also observed These data suggest that tolvaptan not only stimulates water diuresis, but also natriuresis, without reducing RRF in PD patients. Hence, tolvaptan could be a beneficial tool for the control of body fluid and maintenance of RRF in PD patients.","89":"Because of a higher (but improving) incidence of technique failure, peritoneal dialysis (PD) is not thought to equal hemodialysis (HD) for long-term use. Other than death and transplantation, the reasons that patients leave PD include peritonitis, catheter problems, patient burnout, and (in long-duration patients) the development of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis or ultrafiltration failure. Here, we report 2 patients who have been on continuous ambulatory PD continuously for more than 12 years, maintaining good ultrafiltration and clearances. In the case reports, we suggest potential reasons for the long duration of therapy in these women. We conclude that, in some patients on continuous ambulatory PD who sparingly use very hyperosmolar dextrose solutions and who are able to avoid frequent episodes of peritonitis, long-term PD is possible and may not require transition to HD.","90":"Data regarding the outcomes of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients undergoing nephrectomy are limited. In the 20-year retrospective study reported here, we included patients who underwent nephrectomy and then subsequently started PD within 1 year (group A) and those who underwent nephrectomy while already on PD (group B). We examined mechanical complications including incisional hernia, peritoneal leak, and wound infection or dehiscence. Among biochemical outcomes (group B only), we analyzed serum creatinine, albumin, potassium, and phosphate for 1 year pre- and post-nephrectomy. Among the 8 patients identified (4 in group A, 4 in group B), 7 underwent unilateral nephrectomy, and 1, bilateral nephrectomy. Surgery was laparoscopic in 1 patient and open in 7 patients. The approach was transperitoneal in 5 patients, and retroperitoneal in 3 patients. Incisional hernia occurred in 4 patients (2 in each group), and retroperitoneal leak was seen in 1 patient in group B after 2 months. No wound dehiscence or other complications occurred. In group B, 2 patients required hybrid therapy in the form of once-weekly hemodialysis with continuous ambulatory PD. Among the biochemical complications, we noted that serum creatinine increased (as expected), and serum albumin significantly declined and remained lower post-nephrectomy. Our data show that, post-nephrectomy, PD patients have a high incidence of incisional hernia. They also experience a significant decline in serum albumin and a substantial loss in residual kidney function potentially requiring intensified dialysis. The retroperitoneal approach may on occasion predispose to retroperitoneal leak of dialysate.","91":"Increased peritoneal clearance can compensate for reductions in renal solute removal in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD); however there is abundant evidence to suggest that renal rather than peritoneal clearance contributes to clinical outcomes. We review the evidence investigating the impact of residual renal function (RRF) and peritoneal solute clearances on survival and quality of life in PD patients. We also provide a comparison of the relative contribution of RRF and peritoneal clearance to patient survival. In addition, mechanisms of survival benefit in patients with preserved renal function, factors contributing to RRF decline, and interventions that may limit the progressive loss of RRF are discussed.","92":"Increased left ventricular mass index (LVMI) is commonly observed in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). The present study aimed to determine the effect of icodextrin (Ico) on LVMI in PD patients with maintained residual renal function (RRF). This retrospective study included 18 patients (12 men, 6 women; average age: 62 +\/- 10 years) diagnosed with indications for PD therapy and divided into two groups: those treated with Ico (Ico group) and without Ico (non-Ico group). Echocardiography was performed at the beginning of continuous ambulatory PD and after 6 and 12 months. A significant reduction in LVMI (p &lt; 0.01) and an increase in ultrafiltration (p &lt; 0.01) were observed after 6 months of lco treatment and were maintained for 12 months. Ejection fraction was significantly lower in the non-Ico group after 12 months (p &lt; 0.01), but was not altered in the Ico group. Blood pressure, cardiothoracic ratio, urine volume, and N-terminal prohormone of brain natriuretic peptide were unaffected by PD treatment up to 12 months. The year-averaged ultrafiltration and the reduction in LVMI were significantly correlated (p &lt; 0.05). Ico effectively improved LVMI and maintained ejection fraction in end-stage renal disease patients within 1 year from PD initiation. Notably, treatment with Ico resulted in a reduction of LVMI (associated with increased ultrafiltration), with no significant reduction in RRF.","93":"Among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, cardiovascular disease is a common comorbidity and one of most important factors affecting clinical prognosis. Calcium deposition has been reported to correlate with plasma phosphate. Icodextrin (Ico)-based peritoneal dialysis (PD) has many advantages over glucose (Glu)-based PD. We aimed to identify factors that suppress arteriosclerosis and valvular disease in patients with ESRD and diabetes mellitus (DM) undergoing Ico-based PD. In this retrospective study, we evaluated the effects of Ico-based PD (n = 20) on phosphate elimination and cardiovascular disease progression in patients with ESRD andDM, and we compared the results with those for Glu-based PD (n = 20). Left ventricular mass index (LVMI) and aortic valve calcification (AVC) score were significantly decreased and daily phosphate elimination was significantly increased in the Ico group compared with the Glu group. Furthermore, mean daily phosphate elimination was significantly and negatively correlated with the amelioration in LVMI and AVC score. Our study suggests that, compared with glucose, icodextrin has the ability to eliminate more phosphate from the body, indicating that phosphate elimination might potentially be a means of controlling cardiovascular disease in PD patients with DM.","94":"Icodextrin-based peritoneal dialysis (PD) has many advantages over glucose-based PD. The present study aimed to investigate when icodextrin should be started for better management of cardiovascular status (as defined by echocardiography findings) and residual renal function (RRF). We retrospectively analyzed 40 patients treated with continuous ambulatory PD or automated PD. The patients were divided into these groups: Group A: started icodextrin within 2 weeks after PD onset. Group B: started icodextrin 1 year after PD onset. Group C: started icodextrin 2 years after PD onset. Group D: never used icodextrin during the study period. At the start of PD, we observed no significant difference in left ventricular mass index (LVMI) or urine volume (UV) between the groups. At 4 years, LVMI and UV were both significantly improved in group A compared with group D. The amelioration in LVMI was negatively associated with phosphate elimination. Our study showed that icodextrin preserved RRF and ameliorated left ventricular hypertrophy. Moreover, the timing of icodextrin introduction in PD patients influenced the clinical effects, including progression of cardiac hypertrophy and RRF.","95":"Patients with end-stage renal disease treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) are often put on standard one size fits all\" regimens, despite having varying degrees of residual renal function (RRF). The present study reports our experience with initiation of PD using 2 icodextrin exchanges daily in patients with RRF corresponding to a weekly Kt\/Vurea of at least 1.0. Peritoneal and RRF Kt\/Vurea were tracked closely, and total Kt\/Vurea was maintained between 1.7 and 2.0. One patient developed a rash and was changed to 3 dextrose exchanges daily. All patients were satisfied with their treatment regimen, and no other adverse events or symptoms were reported.","96":"","97":"The incidence of metabolic syndrome is about 50% in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The positive association of metabolic syndrome with lower physical activity (PA) has been reported in the general population, but the effect of PA in PD patients has not been clarified. The purpose of the present study was to evaluate PA in PD patients and to clarify the correlations between PA and various clinical parameters in PD patients. We assessed 38 PD patients (22 men; age: 63.9 +\/- 10.8 years; body mass index: 24.0 +\/- 3.9; 15 with diabetes) who had been treated with PD at least for 3 months. We defined PA as the average number of steps per day measured using a pedometer for 1 month. Blood biochemical findings and dialysis adequacy were measured as clinical parameters. Of the 38 patients, only 11 (29%) reached the steps per day of healthy individuals. In addition, steps per day were significantly correlated with serum albumin (r = 0.45, p = 0.01), C-reactive protein (r = -0.33, p = 0.04), and age (r = -0.34, p = 0.04). Multiple regression analysis showed that serum albumin was the only variable that significantly correlated with steps per day (beta = 0.42, p = 0.01). Our study showed that PA declines significantly in PD patients, which might correlate with malnutrition-inflammation-atherosclerosis syndrome.","98":"The relationship between dialysis vintage (length of time on dialysis), body composition, and survival has been reported in hemodialysis patients. In the present study, we examined the association ofdialysis vintage with body composition and survival in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. At enrollment, body composition in 65 PD patients was determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis. Patients (mean age at enrollment: 54 years) were followed for up to 11 years maximum. At enrollment, the mean, median, and maximum dialysis vintages were 51, 34, and 261 months respectively. After adjusting for age, race, sex, and diabetes status, dialysis vintage was indirectly correlated (partial correlation coefficients) with body weight (r = -0.40, p = 0.001), body mass index (r = -0.40, p = 0.002), body surface area (r = -0.39, p = 0.002), body cell mass (r = -0.39, p = 0.002), total body fat weight (r = -0.30, p = 0.02), and fat percentage of body weight (r = -0.31, p = 0.018), and directly correlated with extracellular mass to body cell mass ratio (r = 0.27, p = 0.039). The observed cumulative survival was significantly higher (p = 0.007) in patients with a dialysis vintage at enrollment of 35 months or less, than in patients with dialysis vintage at enrollment of more than 35 months. In the multivariate Cox regression analysis, adjusting for age, race, sex, and diabetes, dialysis vintage at enrollment remained an independent predictor of mortality (relative risk: 1.010; p = 0.002). Increase in relative risk of death with increasing dialysis vintage may be partly explained by the association of vintage with unfavorable changes in body composition and the nutrition status of patients over time.","99":"Among women with chronic kidney disease, successful pregnancy with a surviving infant is rather rare. Although these pregnancies carry higher risk, with the possibility of adverse maternal and fetal outcomes, they can be managed with close monitoring and intense renal replacement therapy. Given the hemodynamic advantages of peritoneal dialysis over hemodialysis in pregnancy, peritoneal dialysis therapy is thought to be a favorable renal replacement option in pregnant patients with chronic kidney disease.","100":"During the past several decades, the conventional management of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients undergoing elective abdominal surgery required a transition to hemodialysis on a temporary basis. In recent years, that protocol has been challenged by various authors who successfully repaired hernias in such subjects without interruption of their PD modality. However, that new approach was reserved for abdominal wall procedures and was not used for intra-abdominal surgery. The rapid evolution of laparoscopic surgery and the development and refinement of minimally invasive surgical techniques have revolutionized the field of surgery by providing superior outcomes for an ever-increasing list of indications including morbid obesity. The present study, the first of its kind involving elective intra-abdominal surgery, sought to determine the safety of uninterrupted PD therapy in morbidly obese patients with stage 6 chronic kidney disease undergoing laparoscopic bariatric surgery as a precursor to transplantation.","101":"Between November 2009 and September 2011, 12 patients (6 women, 6 men) undergoing continuous peritoneal dialysis (PD) or automated PD developed puncture-like holes in the PD catheter near the interface of the adapter with the superior aspect of the Silastic PD catheter The adapter is used to connect the PD catheter to the PD transfer set. Over the course of 23 months, the 12 patients presented to the PD unit with 19 separate instances of catheter holes, for an event rate of 0.23 holes per patient-year Data including socio-demographic information, PD modality, need for antibiotic treatment, event recurrence, infectious complications, and time from catheter placement were collected from patients whose catheters did and did not develop holes. We observed no differences between patients whose catheters developed holes and those whose catheters did not. The location of the individual holes suggested a relationship between the adapter and the catheter holes. The holes, which led to increased patient morbidity and costs, may be related to structural changes made in 2006 to the adapter.","102":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions are currently sterilized in an autoclave using high-temperature saturated steam. Although thermal methods are an effective means of sterilization, the heating of PD solutions results in the formation of toxic glucose degradation products (GDPs). Here, we review basic concepts in the sterilization of PD solutions and discuss possible alternatives to steam sterilization, including filtration, ohmic heat, ionizing radiation, and pulsed ultraviolet light. Although the latter methods have several advantages, many also have prohibitive limitations or have not been adequately studied for use on PD solutions. Thus, in the absence of suitable alternatives, conventional heat sterilization, in combination with low-GDP manufacturing practices, remains the best option at the present time.","103":"Although dialytic removal of phosphate significantly contributes to the management of phosphate levels in end-stage renal disease, many patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) still do not reach optimal phosphate control. The present review discusses the impact of PD modality--continuous ambulatory (CAPD) or automated (APD)--on phosphate removal. Relevant factors are the diffusive properties of the phosphate anion and the kinetics of phosphate distribution in various body compartments. Confounders that potentially affect comparisons of phosphate clearances in CAPD and APD are differences in residual renal function, membrane transport status, and prescribed dialysis dose. The evidence reviewed here is not strong enough to clearly determine if one modality has a clear advantage with respect to phosphate removal. In the absence of final proof the data suggest that, given the same residual renal function and dialysis dose, CAPD might be slightly more effective than APD at peritoneal phosphate clearance, especially in low transporters.","104":"We set out to assess the effect of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) on residual renal function (RRF) in children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). In 101 children (age: 8.84 +\/- 5.25 years; 44 on CAPD, 57 on APD) over 36 months, we evaluated RRF [as daily diuresis (DD) in mL\/kg\/24 h and mL\/m2\/24 h], glomerular filtration rate [GFR (in mL\/min\/1.73 m2)], ESRD cause, presence of arterial hypertension (HTN), biochemical parameters, peritoneal equilibration test (PET), adequacy [as total weekly Kt\/V (twKt\/V) and creatinine clearance (twCCr)], and infectious complications of PD. Initially, the CAPD and APD groups did not differ significantly in DD, but mean GFR was significantly higher in the APD group (p &lt; 0.05). In the CAPD group, the volume of high osmolarity PD fluid was significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05), and the rates of peritonitis and exit-site infection and of aminoglycoside use were higher (p &lt; 0.001, p &lt; 0.05, and p &lt; 0.005 respectively). Over 36 months, the mean twKt\/V and twCCr were within norms in both groups, but were higher in APD, significantly so (p &lt; 0.05) for twKt\/V at 24 and 36 months and for twCCr initially. In both groups, RRF decreased systematically, with a significantly lower (p &lt; 0.05) rate of DD (mL\/m2\/24 h) and GFR decline in the first year in CAPD, but without a difference in the next 2 years. The longest RRF preservation was in children with tubulointerstitial nephropathies, particularly hypoplasia and dysplasia (p &lt; 0.05). Children with hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS) and hereditary nephropathy were at the highest anuria risk. Compared with the 22 children (7 CAPD, 15 APD) who became anuric, the 20 children (10 CAPD, 10 APD) with RRF preserved for 36 months had a higher DD and GFR before dialysis onset; higher hemoglobin and albumin; and lower HTN prevalence, cholesterol, triglycerides, and proteinuria (p &lt; 0.05). Risk of anuria during 36 months did not differ significantly between the CAPD and APD groups. In children on CAPD or APD, risk factors for RRF loss include HUS, hereditary nephropathy, low diuresis and GFR before dialysis onset, HTN, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and proteinuria. Compared with children on APD, those on CAPD show better preservation of RRF during year 1, although the risk of anuria seems to be the same for both methods. In children with risk factors for rapid diuresis loss, CAPD might be considered the preferred initial dialysis method.","105":"Recent studies have clearly demonstrated that start ing treatment with peritoneal dialysis (PD) is superior to starting with conventional hemodialysis (HD) because PD preserves residual renal function for a longer period. Similarly, because of the frequency of treatments, home HD (HHD) is also superior to conventional HD. The accumulated evidence suggests that a combination of PD and HHD might be a new and effective method for patients receiving dialysis therapy. We analyzed 10 patients who, over the past 10 years, were started on PD and who were then transferred to HHD. Electronic databases were used to examine changes in their health status. Mean age was 58 +\/- 8 years in these 2 female and 8 male patients. Mean duration of PD was 6.9 +\/- 2.4 years. The average total duration of dialysis therapy was 9.7 +\/- 1.9 years. The main reason for the transition from PD to HHD was loss of residual renal function. To the time of writing, no serious complications (including cardiovascular events and calcium homeostasis) had occurred. All patients continue to receive dialysis therapy and have been able to lead a nearly normal social life. Major laboratory findings include serum albumin 4.2 +\/- 0.2 g\/dL, hemoglobin 10.2 +\/- 1.4 g\/dL (half the patients were not using erythropoiesis-stimulating agents), serum creatinine 7.5 +\/- 2.5 mg\/dL, blood urea nitrogen 36 +\/- 17 mg\/dL, serum phosphate 4.3 mg\/dL. In two thirds of the patients, blood pressure was controlled without antihypertensive agents. No patient had left ventricular hypertrophy. In this analysis, we found that relatively young subjects preferred PD first, with later transfer to HHD; that PD is superior as an introduction to dialysis therapy; that patients starting with PD prefer self medical treatment; and that all patients were free from the various complications that are encountered during long-term dialysis therapy. We suggest that patients who need dialysis therapy consider this new dialysis approach of \"PD first and transfer to HHD.\"","106":"Urgent-start peritoneal dialysis (PD) can be defined as initiation of PD within 2 weeks of catheter insertion. Urgent-start PD can be offered to patients who are referred late to a nephrologist and who would typically be initiated on hemodialysis with a temporary vascular access. An urgent-start PD capability requires expedited options education, catheter placement, unique change in the PD unit infrastructure, and new processes of care. This report describes the urgent-start PD program established by a nephrology private practice in the United States. Operational aspects of the program and initial clinical results are described.","107":"Peritoneal dialysis can be considered a \"wearable\" dialysis therapy. However, patients typically require 3 or 4 daily exchanges, each taking 20-40 minutes and potentially increasing the risk of infection by repeated disconnection and reconnection. Although peritoneal dialysis cyclers allow patients to be \"free\" from their machine for 13-15 hours, they similarly need a supply of fresh dialysate. Several groups have therefore explored the possibility of trying to minimize dialysate exchanges by recycling dialysate. However, that approach introduces not only a series of challenges, including regeneration of the spent dialysate, maintenance of acid-base and electrolyte balance and adequate ultrafiltration, but also new hurdles to be overcome, including monitoring the sorbents to determine when capacity is exceeded. The proposed Vicenza Wearable Artificial Kidney system consists of a continuous-flow peritoneal dialysis system that combines sorbents in series and urease to regenerate dialysate during the day, and a 7.5% icodextrin exchange overnight.","108":"Post-transplant lymphoproliferative disease (PTLD) is a rare but life-threatening complication after solid organ transplantation. The risk of PTLD varies with recipient age, serostatus of the donor and the recipient for Epstein-Barr virus, type of organ transplanted, and intensity of immunosuppression. The risk of PTLD is highest in the early post-transplant period, but the cumulative risk increases with time. We report a case of PTLD occurring 17 years after renal transplantation in a 59-year-old woman.","109":"The impact of pre-transplant dialysis modality on kidney transplant outcomes has been the impetus for many discrepant reports. Although candidacy for kidney transplantation may not necessarily be the main factor in deciding the choice of pre-transplant dialysis modality, certain complications are thought to be associated with one dialysis modality compared with the other and should be acknowledged. Most of the evidence to date, especially that for lower rates of delayed graft function, indicates an advantage for peritoneal dialysis (PD) over hemodialysis. More importantly, some groups of recipients clearly benefit more from receiving PD pre-transplant, a finding that was recently reported for high-risk adult recipients of expanded-criteria donor organs and pediatric recipients of living-donor organs. On the other hand, PD may be associated with a higher risk of early graft thrombosis. Moreover, the published literature highlights the need for caution in older candidates with a family history of diabetes mellitus because of potential higher risk for new-onset post-transplantation diabetes mellitus in PD patients. Interestingly, prospective studies validating those findings are scarce; most of the published reports have been limited by either small patient numbers or a lack of consideration of other confounding risk factors. In the present review, we examined the available literature related to the influence of pre-transplant dialysis modality on post-transplant allograft and recipient outcomes.","110":"The role of peritoneal dialysis (PD) in the treatment of end-stage renal disease in elderly patients remains unclear. In the United States, PD is used only to a limited extent in that population. There are concerns about technique failure, including physical and psychosocial limitations and the risks of peritonitis. Thus, we retrospectively reviewed our 22 years of experience with patients 75 years of age and older who started on PD. Basic demographic data were collected, and mortality, technique failure, and peritonitis rates were determined. Quality of life (QOL) was assessed using the SF-36 questionnaire, a global QOL assessment, and a depression questionnaire. Among the 235 patients identified (mean age: 79 +\/- 4 years; 51% white; 49% female; mean time on PD: 15.8 +\/- 11.5 months), technique failure rates at 12 months were not significantly different for the patients 75 years of age older compared with the patients less than 75 years of age. Mortality rates were significantly higher in elderly patients. The peritonitis rate in patients 75 years of age and older was 1 episode in 23.6 patient-months compared with 1 episode in 23 patient-months in younger patients. The most common gram-positive organisms isolated were Staphylococcus epidermidis (38%0) and S. aureus (50%); gram-negative organisms accounted for 22%, and yeasts, 5% of peritonitis episodes. Reasons for transfer to hemodialysis included psychosocial problems (42%) and peritonitis (25%). Not surprisingly, physical component scores on the SF-36 were lower in the older than in the younger patients, but mental component scores on the SF-36 were slightly better in older than in younger patients, and global QOL and depression scores were not different between the groups. Our data suggest that PD is a reasonable modality for elderly patients.","111":"People over the age of 80 years are the fastest-growing segment of the population with stage 5 chronic kidney disease, which is dialysis initiation. We set out to describe the experiences of those elderly patients in initiating and being maintained on peritoneal dialysis. We interviewed 4 patients (1 woman, 3 men; time on dialysis: 2-5 years) 75-88 years of age. A predetermined set of questions evaluating 7 domain topics were asked. The topics were initiating dialysis, dialysis knowledge, physical condition, social support, experience of dialysis, psychological support, and coordination of care. These in-depth interviews were analyzed in each category to determine common themes. Within each domain, several themes were identified. The themes most important for physicians to understand to be able to deliver a high level of care to elderly patients on dialysis were the importance of peer and family influence on decision-making, the patient's support system, the patient's integration into the community, and the patient's increased perception of autonomy. Patients in this age group on peritoneal dialysis have strong support systems and an increased perception of autonomy that allows them to be integrated into their community through hobbies and other social engagements.","112":"A broad consensus has not been reached on the appropriate timing for cessation of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Decreasing urine volume, repeated and refractory peritonitis, and deterioration of the peritoneal membrane are major reasons to stop PD. Also, the link between length of time on PD and encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) should be an additional concern. The aim of the present study was to investigate patients who had been on continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) for a long time. All patients undergoing CAPD at our kidney center for more than a decade from January 1990 to September 2011 were included in the study. Among more than 436 CAPD patients, 11 met the inclusion criteria. Their mean PD duration was 12.3 +\/- 3.1 years. Mean age at CAPD introduction had been 46.0 +\/- 10.1 years. All patients had nondiabetic nephropathy as the underlying cause of their end-stage renal disease. At least 2 of the 11 had developed EPS, and 1 had subsequently died from EPS. Patients on prolonged CAPD for more than a decade are still rare. The CAPD modality may be continued if it is efficiently maintained within an acceptable level, but EPS remains a serious complication of prolonged PD.","113":"Although peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been recommended for initial dialysis therapy, a larger proportion of patients with end-stage renal disease choose hemodialysis (HD) instead. Several previous studies comparing the outcomes of these two therapies, including survival rates and cardiovascular events, have not clearly demonstrated the superiority of one over the other. Our recent study indicated that, compared with HD or PD alone, renal replacement therapy with HD and PD in combination prolongs survival and reduces cardiovascular events. However, the use of combination dialysis therapy is not widely accepted. We set out to analyze the efficacy of combination dialysis therapy with PD and HD in patients who started with PD as initial dialysis therapy. Our single-center retrospective cohort study included 401 patients (165 women, 236 men; 61 +\/- 12 and 62 +\/- 9 years of age respectively) who started PD during 1995-2005. Chart and electronic databases were used to obtain information on the course of dialysis therapy, including mortality and cardiovascular events. Treatment with HD and PD in combination was used in 103 patients. During 5 years of follow-up after the start of PD, 80 patients died. We observed no differences in cumulative mortality between the men (49, 200%) and women (31, 18%) and no difference in the cumulative incidence of catheter removal for various reasons (35% vs. 31%). There was a significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) in the time of HD start between men and women. In men on PD, HD therapy was started 22 +\/- 2 months after the start of PD; in women, it was started 38 +\/- 7 months after PD start. Although women have a survival advantage in both the general and the dialysis patient population, women on PD experience mortality similar to that in men. The reasons for those findings have not been fully explained. The present analysis suggests that an early start to HD therapy will prolong the survival of patients on PD, especially men.","114":"Data on survival after transfer from peritoneal dialysis (PD) to hemodialysis (HD) is conflicting. We reviewed two decades of outcomes in a PD program to examine short-term survival after transfer from PD to HD. Of 379 patients on PD, 33% transferred to HD. The reasons for transfer were PD-related infections (340%), uremia or failure to thrive (26%), PD catheter problems or loss of mechanical skills (15%), dementia or unable to train (7%), noncompliant with PD (7%), other (10%, including gastrointestinal complications, hernia, encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis, preference, loss of ultrafiltration), and cardiac (2%). All of those transferring for \"other\" reasons survived 6 months, and as did all except 1 who transferred for uremia (p = 0.035). Overall survival was 92% at 3 months and 85% at 6 months. Using multivariate logistic regression analysis, only score on the Charlson comorbidity index at PD start was a risk factor for dying in the first 6 months on HD: for each 1 point increase in CCI score, the hazard ratio for death was 1.4 (95% confidence interval: 1.16 to 1.74; p = 0.005). To summarize, starting a patient on PD and waiting until uremia to transfer to HD does not have a negative impact on survival. In a program with relatively low PD-related infectious complications, such complications accounted for only one third of transfers to HD.","115":"Comparisons of technique success by peritoneal dialysis (PD) modality have typically excluded the initial 90 days of therapy. We analyzed a database of 51,469 new PD starts from 2004 to 2008 in the United States. The analysis concentrated on the initial 90 days of therapy to determine technique success and the impact of the continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) and automated PD (APD) modalities. Overall, 13.3% of patients stopped PD within 90 days. Of patients starting directly on APD, 14.3% stopped PD within 90 days. Of patients starting on CAPD, 12.6% stopped PD within 90 days, and 63.4% changed to APD within 90 days. Only 3.3% of the latter patients failed to reach 90 days of therapy. By comparison, technique failure occurred in 28.8% of those initiating with and remaining on CAPD. We conclude that initial training to perform CAPD, with timely transfer to APD within the first 3 months, was associated with the greatest technique success at 90 days. The reasons for that success are unclear, and further research should be directed to determining factors responsible. It is possible that patients trained initially to CAPD but converted to APD have a greater understanding of the total therapy, which improves confidence. Those converted to APD may be more appreciative of the lifestyle benefits of APD, which translates into improved compliance; alternatively, technical factors associated with APD may be responsible. Those technical factors may include improved catheter function in the recumbent position during APD or the reduced infection risk associated with just 2 connect\/disconnect procedures in APD compared with 8 in CAPD.","116":"In their broad spectrum, cardiovascular diseases are, collectively, the major cause of death in patients on dialysis. The population of patients treated with peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis are not only subject to the traditional risk factors for heart disease, but also to certain uremia-associated risk factors that are unique in this population. In the dialysis population, data regarding the effectiveness of routine pharmacologic and procedural interventions on cardiovascular outcomes are limited. Most dialysis patients are excluded from clinical trials, and so data from randomized controlled trials investigating outcomes in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis are almost absent. In this review, we discuss some of the major cardiovascular problems in the dialysis population, the impact of those problems on survival, and when data are available, the impact of therapeutic strategies.","117":"Peritonitis remains a leading complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). The aim of this observational retrospective cohort study, conducted at our single center, was to determine the risk factors for peritonitis. A Cox proportional hazards model was used for the multivariate analysis. The event investigated was peritonitis, and the variables studied were sex, age, diabetes mellitus, use of statins, and several laboratory values including albumin and total cholesterol. All PD patients who visited our clinic from January 2005 to September 2011 and who had complete medical records for at least 3 years were included. Among the 82 patients who met the criteria (mean period of observation: 1086 +\/- 752 days; mean age: 62.0 +\/- 12.3 years), 47 had experienced at least 1 episode of peritonitis. Aging was a significant risk factor for peritonitis, with a relative risk of 1.04 per year (p = 0.014). In our study, aging--rather than diabetes mellitus, efficiency of PD, or nutrition status--was an important risk factor for PD-associated peritonitis. Poor PD technique because of advanced age might be one of the reasons for this result.","118":"Peritonitis (P) is the most important infectious complication in peritoneal dialysis (PD), but disagreement remains about the impact of PD modality on the frequency of P episodes. We compared indices linked to P between patients on continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) and those on automated PD (APD) in the short and very long term. The study included 9 prevalent and 72 incident patients on CAPD (twin-bag system) and 37 incident patients on APD from 4 August 1995 to 31 March 2011. Data were collected prospectively from our database. The cumulative P rate (CPR) by weighted Student t-test (p &lt; 0.05) expressed as the probabilities of remaining free of a first P episode and remaining free of all P episodes were compared by the Kaplan-Meier method (log rank p &lt; 0.05). The proportion of patients with P (PPP) per group (chi2 p &lt; 0.05) and the relative risk (RR) of P were also calculated. The CAPD patients included 51 women and 30 men [mean age.: 50.2 +\/- 14.21 years (range: 15-82 years); duration of treatment: 3579 patient-months (mean: 44.2 +\/- 34.2 patient-months); P episodes: 111] had a CPR of 0.38 episodes (1 episode in 31.35 patient-months) and a P rate per year (PRY) in the range 0.08-0.89 episodes. The APD patients [23 women and 14 men; mean age: 53.62 +\/- 13.61 years (range: 26-78 years); duration of treatment: 1718 patient-months (mean: 46.4-38.3 patient-months); P episodes: 46] had a CPR of 0.32 episodes (1 episode in 373 patient--months) and a PRY in the range 0-1.12 episodes. At 1, 3, 5, and 10 years respectively, a first P episode occurred in 73%, 36%, 23%, and 8% of CAPD and 72%, 59%, 35%, and 23% ofAPD patients (log-rank p = 0. 056; CPR: p = 0.01; PPP: chi2 p = 0.39), for a RR of 0.83 linked to CAPD compared with APD. A lower P frequency and a trend of less time to first P was observed for APD compared with CAPD. The CAPD patients did not show a higher risk of developing P than did the APD patients. For comparisons between the modalities, CPR is a reliable index in the very long term at risk. Depending on the size of the population and the time at risk, the PRYobtained on short follow-up could result in a misinterpretation of the performance of each treatment modality.","119":"The underlying pathophysiology that leads to morphologic and functional changes in the peritoneal membrane over time among patients on peritoneal dialysis is not well understood. Many studies have been conducted to try to abrogate those changes and so preserve peritoneal function. Conventional interventions that attempt to accomplish that end include prevention of peritonitis, timely removal of the peritoneal catheter in the face of non-resolving peritonitis, use of biocompatible dialysate, and limitation of total glucose exposure by avoiding hypertonic dextrose solutions. Inhibition of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone and vascular endothelial growth factor systems, peritoneal resting, combined peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis, and N-acetylcysteine and gene therapy are more novel and experimental attempts to preserve the peritoneal membrane. We review the novel studies that have aimed to promote the health and function of this dialyzing membrane.","120":"A large elevation in serum creatinine (S(Cr)) on an unchanged peritoneal dialysis (PD) schedule is usually caused by a decrease in total creatinine clearance (C(Cr)), but may also reflect an increase in creatinine (Cr) production. A meticulously compliant 43-year-old man with lupus nephritis on automated nocturnal PD plus an additional daytime exchange developed a rise in S(Cr) to 16.73 mg\/dL from 8.06 mg\/dL after starting fenofibrate, while total C(Cr) decreased only to 61.5 L\/1.73 m2 from 77.4 m2 weekly. Creatinine excretion was 16.4 mg\/(kg x 24 h) pre-fenofibrate. It increased to a high of 26.2 mg\/(kg x 24 h) during the period of fenofibrate intake and returned to 21.9 mg\/ (kg x 24 h) 2 months after discontinuation of that drug. The patient's age, weight, height, body mass index, 24-h drain and urine volumes, total Kt\/V urea, serum urea nitrogen, urea nitrogen excretion, and (for the pre-fenofibrate period) S(Cr), Cr excretion, estimated Cr production, and measured-to-predicted Cr excretion (using a formula developed in PD patients) were within the 95% confidence intervals (CIs) obtained in a control group of 24 other men on similar PD schedules. The patient's Cr excretion and production were above the 95% CIs of the control group while he was on fenofibrate, and they returned toward or within the 95% CIs after cessation of the drug. The patient's serum creatine phosphokinase was not elevated while he was taking fenofibrate. A thorough investigation of the potential mechanisms of a rise in S(Cr) during the course of PD is warranted to determine if the rise is disproportional to any fall in total C(Cr). In the latter case, Cr excretion and production should be evaluated, and if elevated, conditions potentially causing the rise in Cr production (fenofibrate in this patient) should be sought, and appropriate therapeutic interventions should be implemented.","121":"Models of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) are often based on local administration of chemical irritants. Our aim was to develop a clinically relevant \"two-hit\" model with incorporation of renal failure and exposure to conventional dialysis solutions. We randomly allocated 36 male Wistar rats that had undergone catheter implantation and a 70% nephrectomy to 3 peritoneal infusion groups. The experimental group was exposed to a 3.86% glucose-based conventional dialysis solution for 8 weeks, after which the animals received a second hit of intraperitoneal blood administration. Two weeks later the rats were humanely euthanized The two control groups were exposed to the conventional dialysis solution alone or to a buffer without glucose for 8 weeks. All animals underwent a peritoneal function test at the end of the experiment. Peritoneal adhesions were counted at autopsy, and omental tissue was obtained for morphometrics. The rats that received blood as a second hit developed numerous intraperitoneal adhesions as seen in EPS, but without cocoon formation. Microscopically, no differences in fibrosis scores and vessel counts were observed between the groups. Peritoneal function parameters were also similar in all groups. The short infusion period could be the reason that we found no differences between the groups, with the exception of the large amount of intraperitoneal adhesions in the experimental group. Modifications to the described rat model are required to develop a clinically relevant EPS model. Besides renal failure and long-term exposure to bioincompatibleperitoneal dialysis solutions, a different second hit or several additional hits could be incorporated into an experimental model of EPS.","122":"Prednisolone and other glucocorticosteroids are used by some peritoneal dialysis patients because of underlying diseases such as peritonitis. Although corticosteroids are potent inhibitors of various processes during inflammation, their influence on the transport properties of peritoneum is little known. Our study investigated the influence of prednisolone (0.001 g\/dL) on glucose (1.8 g\/dL) and uric acid (0.02 g\/dL) transfer across isolated parietal peritoneum taken from the anterior abdominal wall of white Hyplus 59 rabbits and placed inside a modified Ussing-type chamber. Values for transfer from the interstitial (I) to the mesothelial (M) side of membrane (I--&gt;M) and in the opposite direction (M--&gt;I) were calculated using the mathematical model of mass transport and are expressed as a coefficient of diffusive permeability [P (in centimeters per second)]. Four separate series of experiments were done. In the first and second series, we respectively examined glucose transport under control conditions (for 120 minutes) and then before (15-60 minutes) and after (75-120 minutes) introduction of prednisolone on the M side of the membrane. In the third and fourth series, similar studies of uric acid transfer were done. In the control (first and third) series, the stability of bidirectional transport for solute of interest was observed. The values of P +\/- standard error of the mean (all x0.0001) for I--&gt;M and M--&gt;I transfer of glucose were, respectively, 2.489 +\/- 0.329 cm\/s and 2.259 +\/- 0.493 cm\/s. In the case of uric acid, the transport values were lower and amounted 1.936 +\/- 0.324 cm\/s and 1.895 +\/- 0.596 cm\/s for I--&gt;M and M--&gt;I respectively. Application of prednisolone on the M side of membrane lowered bidirectional transfer of glucose across peritoneal membrane by a mean of 73% (p &lt; 0.02) and transport of uric acid by a mean of 19% (p &lt; 0.003). These results show that, in vitro, prednisolone lowers glucose and uric acid transport across the peritoneal membrane, modifying the transfer dynamics of glucose to a greater extent. These observations may have clinical importance, especially in patients with disorders of peritoneal permeability, diabetes, and hyperuricemia.","123":"In a comprehensive evaluation of dialysis adequacy, major attention has been recently paid to fluid and Na balance. Removal of Na has been reported to be significantly poorer with automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) than with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Only limited data on Na removal with tidal APD have been published. We analyzed peritoneal Na mass balance in 122 separate nightly tidal APD sessions performed by 7 peritonitis-free, clinically stable, patients with negligible residual renal function (&lt; 100 mL urine daily). Correlations with other efficiency measures [ultrafiltration (UF) and small-solute clearances], prescriptive parameters [duration of treatment, initial intraperitoneal fill volume (IPV) and its tidal percentage, and dialysate flux] and peritoneal transport status were tested in univariate and multivariate linear regression models. Removal of Na was 89 +\/- 55 mmol per treatment, which correlated with UF (r = 0.29, p = 0.001) and was higher in patients with high-average transport (118 +\/- 41 mmol vs. 81 +\/- 56 mmol in low-average transporters, p = 0.0004), in whom a significant positive correlation was found with initial IPV and duration of treatment (r = 0.55; 95% confidence interval: 0.21 to 0.77; p = 0.0029; and r = 0.66; 95% confidence interval: 0.38 to 0.83; p = 0.0002 respectively). Removal of Na correlated weakly with UF in tidal APD and showed wide inter-patient variability. It should therefore be measured rather than roughly estimated from UF. Its magnitude exposes the anuric patient on nightly APD with a \"dry\" day to the risk of Na retention, unless controlled Na intake or dialytic strategies aimed at enhancing Na removal, or both, are implemented.","124":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are often volume-expanded and have higher-than-normal blood pressure (BP) levels. In the present study, we aimed to investigate the role of fluid balance and salt intake for BP control in our PD patients. The study included 37 patients undergoing PD and having complete data for 3 consecutive months. Patients were allocated to one of two groups based on measured BP in the preceding 3 months: hypertensive patients (BP &gt; 140\/90 mmHg) and normotensive patients (did not meet the hypertensive BP criteria). Volume status was evaluated by bioimpedance analysis. The 37 patients (18 women, 19 men) had a mean age of 46.4 years. The hypertensive and normotensive groups included 17 and 20 patients respectively. Sex, age, and time on PD were similar between the groups. Weight (77.3 +\/- 20.3 kg vs. 64.5 +\/- 9.8 kg, p &lt; 0.05), total sodium load (2649.2 +\/- 621.9 mmol vs. 2272.4 +\/- 511.9 mmol, p &lt; 0.05), daily total sodium removal (160.5 +\/- 74.4 mmol vs. 112.1 +\/- 48.0 mmol, p &lt; 0.05), extracellular water (19.4 +\/- 4.3 L vs. 16.4 +\/- 3.5 L, p &lt; 0.05), and normalized extracellular water (11.6 +\/- 1.9 L vs. 10.1 +\/- 1.8 L, p &lt; 0.05) were all significantly higher in the hypertensive group. Despite higher fluid and sodium removal, hypertensive patients were more hypervolemic than normotensive patients. Increasing fluid and salt removal by peritoneal ultrafiltration results in an increased financial burden and also causes serious clinical problems. Restricting fluid and salt intake is an alternative and safer strategy to maintain good fluid balance.","125":"Peritoneal dialysis requires large solution volumes that increase abdominal girth and stretch the mesothelial cells of the abdominal wall. To address the hypothesis that stretch stimulates those cells to increase synthesis and production of inflammatory cytokines, we grew MeT-5A human mesothelial cells to confluence and placed the cells in growth arrest on BioFlex Collagen membranes (Flexcell International Corporation, Hillsborough, NC, U.S.A.). After 48 hours, cells were either left stationary (STA) or cycled using a 3000T system (Flexcell International Corporation) with a sinusoidal stretch (STR) frequency of 10 cycles per minute and an amplitude of 30%. The supernatant and cells of individual wells were removed at 0, 4, 12, 24, 48, 72, and 96 hours. Supernatant was assayed by ELISA for transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF). After trypsinization, the total number of viable cells in each well was estimated from the lack of trypan blue staining. Total RNA from the cells was extracted, and real-time reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction was used to determine messenger RNA (mRNA) for IL-6, TGF-beta, VEGF, TGF-beta receptors 2 and 3 (TGF-beta-R2, -R3), kinase insert domain receptor (KDR), and FMS-related tyrosine kinase 1 (Flt1). Because of decline of cell numbers and viability, results for STR were compared with those for STA at each time interval up to 72 hours. The mRNA for TGF-beta, VEGF, TGF-beta-R3, and KDR were significantly higher in the STR group throughout the 72 hours, and STR IL-6 mRNA declined nonsignificantly. Normalized to the number of viable cells, supernatant IL-6, TGF-beta, and VEGF were not significantly different between the groups. We conclude that mechanical stress from mesothelial stretch does not enhance mesothelial cell secretion oflL-6, TGF-f, or VEGF, but does increase expression ofTGF-P, VEGF, and their corresponding cell receptors TGF-f-R3 and KDR.","126":"","127":"The objective of the present work was to assess bone mineral density (BMD) and its predictors in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, to check the history of those patients 4 years after the assessment, and to relate thoses outcome to BMD. We used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to measure BMD in 26 patients at the femoral neck (FN), and we related those measurements to demographic, nutrition, and laboratory data. Four years after the assessments, the outcomes of those patients were checked and related to BMD. In the study patients, the mean FN BMD was 0.842 +\/- 0.137 g\/cm2. Serum albumin, lean body mass, alkaline phosphatase (ALP), and treatment with acetylsalicylic acid were significant predictors for BMD in the first multivariate model. A second model included blood pH, serum phosphorus, serum creatinine, and age as significant BMD predictors. Hemoglobin or hematocrit could have replaced phosphorus as a BMD predictor The prevalences of abnormal values for BMD predictors in the study patients were phosphorus &gt; 4.5 mg\/dL, 69.2%; pH &lt; 7.36, 53.8%; albumin &lt; 3.5 g\/dL, 46.1%; ALP &gt; 104 IU\/L, 23.1%; and hemoglobin &lt; 11.0 g\/ dL, 23.1%. In 8 patients, a successful renal transplantation occurred at 8.5 +\/- 9.3 months; 9 patients died at 25.9 +\/- 12.5 months; and 9 patients continued dialysis for a further 50.4 +\/- 1.7 months. The highest BMD was found in the patients who underwent renal transplantation (0.962 +\/- 0.110 g\/cm2); the lowest BMD was found in the patients who died (0.737 +\/- 0.100 g\/ cm2, p = 0.001). In PD patients, low BMD indicates worse outcome. High prevalences of predictors for low BMD (age, poor nutrition status, metabolic acidosis, high phosphorus, anemia) also contribute to worse outcome in PD patients.","128":"Vascular calcification (VC) and arterial stiffness (AS) are major contributors to cardiovascular disease, and in chronic kidney disease, VC and AS are correlated. Disorders of calcium and phosphate metabolism contribute to the progression of VC and to increases in AS. The efficacy of cinacalcet (CIN) in reducing AS in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) has not been determined. The present study enrolled 19 CAPD patients (12 women, 7 men; mean age: 62.2 +\/- 3.6 years) with serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) greater than 500 ng\/dL (mean value: 675 +\/- 106 ng\/dL) in whom daily oral treatment with CIN 25 mg was started. If administration of CIN for 3 months failed to reduce the level of iPTH to less than 300 ng\/dL, the dose of CIN was increased to 50 mg daily. Before the start of CIN and at 3 years after the start of CIN, pulse wave velocity (PWV) was determined. In 11 patients, levels of iPTH were reduced to less than 300 ng\/dL; levels in the rest of the patients remained high. We observed no significant differences in PWV before CIN and at 3 years after CIN start (1856 +\/- 198 cm\/s vs. 1726 +\/- 187 cm\/s). Multivariate regression analysis of PWV demonstrated that both systolic blood pressure and changes in serum levels of phosphate contributed to decreases in PWV In patients receiving CAPD, VC and AS might be the result of higher systolic blood pressure and increased serum levels of phosphate.","129":"Severe secondary hyperparathyroidism is a complication of chronic kidney disease. Paricalcitol is a vitamin D receptor activator with efficacy in the treatment of hyperparathyroidism that also has the minor side effects of hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. As a pleiotropic effect, paricalcitol reduces proteinuria in patients with chronic kidney disease stages 2-4. Oral paricalcitol offers an alternative way to treat hyperparathyroidism and proteinuria in peritoneal dialysis patients. Our prospective study enrolled 18 patients with hyperparathyroidism (6 with diabetes also) who were given oral paricalcitol at initial dose of 1-2 microg daily, depending on their level of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). In the 1st month, iPTH levels declinedsignificantly to 295 +\/- 147 pg\/mL from 670 +\/- 318 pg\/mL, and by the 3rd month, they declined to 192 +\/- 340 pg\/mL (p &lt; 0.001). Without modifications to doses of angiotensin converting-enzyme inhibitor or angiotensin II receptor blocker, proteinuria declined in the 1st month to 1.41 +\/- 1.5 g\/L from 1.68 +\/- 1.7 (p = 0.006) and, in the 3rd month, without statistical significance. In some patients, the dose of paricalcitol was reduced because of iPTH levels that were too low at 1 month. The patients whose doses of paricalcitol were maintained at 3 months showed a reduction in proteinuria to 2.1 +\/- 2.1 g\/L daily from 3.1 +\/- 2. 7 g\/L (p = 0.04) and to 2.3 +\/- 2.1 g\/day from 5.0 +\/- 6.1 g\/day (p = 0.012). In conclusion, paricalcitol is effective for treating hyperparathyroidism in patients on peritoneal dialysis and seems also to have an antiproteinuric effect in these patients.","130":"Recently, demyelinating polyneuropathies have been reported in end-stage renal disease patients. These acute and subacute neuropathies share a demyelinating feature and may develop after the initiation of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. The pathogenesis of these non-chronic forms of neuropathy remains unclear. We report a case of subacute polyneuropathy that posed a clinical dilemma.","131":"The optimal dialysis dose for the treatment of acute kidney injury (AKI) is controversial. No studies have directly examined the effects of peritoneal dialysis (PD) dose on outcomes in AKI. From January 2005 to January 2007, we randomly assigned critically ill patients with AKI to receive higher- or lower-intensity PD therapy (prescribed Kt\/Vof 0.8 and 0.5 per session respectively). The main outcome measure was death within 30 days. Of the 61 enrolled patients, 30 were randomly assigned to higher-intensity therapy, and 31, to a lower-intensity PD dose. The two study groups had similar baseline characteristics and received treatment for 6.1 days and 5.7 days respectively (p = 0.42). At 30 days after randomization, 17 deaths had occurred in the higher-intensity group (55%), and 16 deaths, in the lower-intensity group (53%, p = 0.83). There was a significant difference between the groups in the PD dose prescribed compared with the dose delivered (higher-intensity group: 0.8 vs. 0.59, p = 0.04; lower-intensity group: 0.5 vs. 0.49, p = 0.89). The groups had similar metabolic control after 4 PD sessions (blood urea nitrogen: 69.3 +\/- 14.4 mg\/dL and 60.3 +\/- 11.1 mg\/dL respectively, p = 0. 71). In critically ill patients with AKI, an intensive PD dose did not lower the mortality or improve the recovery of kidney function or metabolic control. The PD dose is limited by dialysate flow and membrane permeability, and clearance per exchange can decrease if a shorter dwell time is applied.","132":"The number of patients with end-stage renal disease continues to increase worldwide, but the 5-year survival probability for patients on dialysis remains low. Preservation of residual renal function (RRF) is widely recognized to be important in the pre-dialysis setting, but now, its benefit for health and quality of life in people on dialysis has been well established. Preservation of RRF has consistently been shown to improve circulating levels of inflammatory markers, middle molecule clearance, blood pressure, and other markers of dialysis adequacy. Residual renal function has also been associated with improved survival on dialysis. This article reviews strategies for preserving RRF in patients on dialysis to improve long-term survival in this population.","133":"Vaccinations are available for primary prevention of many infections in adults. Morbidity and mortality from invasive diseases such as influenza and Streptococcus pneumoniae (pneumococcus) remain high and may be largely preventable by vaccination of high-risk adults, including dialysis patients. The current 23-valent vaccine-efficacious, with a low adverse event profile-is widely available. Revaccination is also recommended in patients with immunocompromising conditions, including chronic kidney disease. Despite having many opportunities to be vaccinated, adult hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients are often missed During the recent H1N1 influenza outbreak, we conducted a performance improvement project to increase the vaccination rates for pneumococcal pneumonia, hepatitis B, and influenza, with a special focus on prevention. The project included an education phase, baseline assessment of vaccination rates, intervention, and a follow-up assessment of vaccination rates. The geographic jurisdiction of ESRD Network 13 encompasses the states of Arkansas, Louisiana, and Oklahoma. At the beginning of the network-wide project, the documented state-specific rates for influenza immunization were below the average influenza immunization rates for adults reported by Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and far below its target for adults. Our improvement project incorporated educational interventions to improve patient acceptance of vaccinations, educational interventions to improve staff participation in quality improvement activities, and improved techniques of quality improvement data collection and analysis by participants. During this project, the immunization rates for hepatitis B and pneumococcal pneumonia were also reviewed. At project's conclusion, improvement was demonstrated in all three focus areas, with statistically significant improvements noted in both influenza and pneumococcus vaccination rates. The use of educational interventions to improve staff participation in quality improvement, and the collection and analysis of quality improvement data can be replicated in many practice settings to improve immunization rates for dialysis patients and other patients with chronic illnesses.","134":"This paper reviews the issues associated with the reproductive system in the special population of female patients with end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis (PD). We summarize current knowledge concerning cancer screening tests, elective and urgent gynecologic procedures, and the issues of menstruation, contraception, pregnancy, and delivery in these patients. Finally, we present the potential effects of gynecologic problems on PD and the complications of PD that can present with symptoms of the female genitalia.","135":"In a chronic disease, traineeship in the methodology to be used to treat oneself is a key part of success from the beginning and during long-term treatment. In chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD), peritonitis emphasizes, in a certain way, the result of the apprenticeship. We set out to evaluate the relationship between the number of PD training lessons and the frequency of peritonitis. According to the number of lessons, we established three groups: A, up to 8 lessons; B, 9-13 lessons; and C, 14 or more lessons. We evaluated peritonitis rates and micro-organisms, and for the three groups, we compared (Kaplan-Meier method) peritonitis-free survival (PFS) at 1 year of treatment, with significance set at (log rank) p &lt; 0.05. The study enrolled 90 patients (mean age: 51.5 +\/- 15.33 years; 37 men). Respectively, groups A, B, and C included 27, 46, and 17 patients with an at-risk duration of 1535, 2879, and 665 patient-months (mean: 56.9 +\/- 44, 62.6 +\/- 47, and 39.1 +\/- 37.8 patient--months), of whom 35%, 37%, and 24% experienced no peritonitis, for peritonitis rates of 0.31, 0.37, and 0.47, with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) peritonitis rates of 0.125, 0.12, and 0.235, and PFS rates of 76.9%, 80.4%, and 70.6%. The PFS was not significantly different between the groups (p &gt; 0.05). During 1 year of treatment, all three groups experienced a satisfactory PFS. More frequent retraining should be considered in patients who needed more training lessons at the start of PD.","136":"The use of almost standardized dialysis programs--and the absence of any adjustment over time in these program to match the progressive decline in residual kidney function, in addition to the reduction in peritoneal depuration because of the frequency of peritonitis and the use of solutions containing high glucose concentrations--often leads to technique drop-out and transfer to hemodialysis. Our study enrolled 15 clinically stable patients (13 white men, 2 white women; average age: 67.3 +\/- 12.99 years; average dialysis vintage: 32.25 +\/- 25.10 months) who had been on automated peritoneal dialysis treatment with a standard treatment profile for at least 6 months (dwell time per cycle and solutions fixed at various glucose concentrations in all exchanges). After a peritoneal equilibration test had been performed and clearances (peritoneal and renal) were measured, the dialysis program was modified, individualizing it to the patient ' peritoneal membrane transport by the Twardowski system of classification and taking into account the patient's residual diuresis and need for ultrafiltration. The change was implemented using the Patient on Line software created by Fresenius Medical Care (Bad Homburg, Germany). After a month of personalized dialysis treatment, weekly peritoneal Kt\/V in the study group increased significantly (to 1.47 + 0.61 from 1.02 +\/- 0.37, p = 0.001); no difference in renal Kt\/V was observed. Total Kt\/V reached levels of optimum dialysis adequacy (to 2.21 +\/- 0.28 from 1.62 +\/- 0.33, p = 0.0001). Weekly peritoneal creatinine clearance also increased to 32.86 +\/- 16.94 L\/1.73 m2 from 22.27 +\/- 9.16 L\/1.73 m2 (p = 0.005), with renal creatinine clearance essentially stable, and total weekly clearance increasing to 67.58 +\/- 14.52 L\/1.73 m2 from 53.51 +\/- 16.86 L\/1.73 m2 (p &lt; 0.0001). The dialysis adequacy improvements obtained involved no statistically significant differences in the total infused volume of dialysis solution, ultrafiltration, or the duration of dialysis treatment. It should also be noted that no changes in residual diuresis occurred.","137":"Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is an uncommon but one of the most serious complications in patients on long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD). The diffuse thickening and sclerosis of the peritoneal membrane that characterizes EPS leads to decreased ultrafiltration and ultimately to bowel obstruction. Given that the prognosis of established EPS is poor, early recognition of the preceding symptoms is essential. Computed tomography of the abdomen is a reliable and noninvasive diagnostic tool. Typical computed tomography features of EPS include peritoneal calcification, bowel wall thickening, peritoneal thickening, loculated fluid collections, and tethered bowel loops. These findings are diagnostic of EPS in the appropriate clinical setting. Here we present a case report of chronic abdominal pain in a patient on maintenance PD representing a case of EPS.","138":"Our understanding of the cardiorenal syndrome continues to progress. Decades of research have led to a better definition of the clinical cardiorenal syndrome and have laid the groundwork for understanding its pathophysiology. Although improvements have been made, there are still knowledge gaps concerning the interactions of these two organ systems. In the present review, we examine those interactions in the setting of acute and chronic cardiac decompensation and the resulting impacts on renal dysfunction. Recognition and prevention of this syndrome may help to better serve a growing patient population.","139":"We previously reported that peritoneal dialysis (PD)-associated peritonitis is a major cause of PD catheter removal. Another major cause is disease of the gastrointestinal tract, including neoplasm and perforation. In the present study, we reviewed the records of patients who underwent catheter removal at our hospital for reasons other than peritoneal infection--and for gastrointestinal disease in particular. Data were collected from the records of patients who received continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) therapy between 2004 and 2010 at the Department of Nephrology, Saitama Medical University. Mean duration of CAPD was 6.2 +\/- 4.7 years, and mean age at onset was 64.5 +\/- 9.6 years. During the investigation period, catheters were removed from 13 patients (4 men, 9 women) because of gastrointestinal disease: gastric cancer in 3 cases, colon cancer in 3 cases, perforation of the lower gastrointestinal tract in 3 cases, and other reasons in 4 cases. Examination of pathology specimens obtained from 6 patients-including 1 in whom contrast-enhanced computed tomography indicated the presence of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS)-revealed mild fibrosis in the subserous layer. No patient died of infection after a surgical procedure. Moreover, throughout the observation period, no patient developed new EPS or postoperative ileus. The present study suggests that CAPD itself seems to be free of untoward effects during the postoperative course in these patients.","140":"The age of new dialysis patients is rapidly increasing. In the present study, we examined clinical presentation in new peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients 80 years of age or older at our hospital. Data were collected from the records of patients newly starting continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD) therapy between January 2005 and July 2010. During that period, 11 patients 80 years of age or older (average age: 83.1 +\/- 3.8 years) were introduced to PD therapy. The reason for dialysis was hypertensive nephrosclerosis in 8 patients, and chronic glomerulonephritis, chronic tubulointerstitial nephritis, and an unknown primary disease in 1 patient each; there were no cases of diabetic nephropathy. At dialysis start, average serum creatinine was 6.1 +\/- 1.4 mg\/dL, arterial wall calcification was found by computed tomography or chest radiography in 10 of 11 patients (90.9%), and aortic or mitral valve calcification, or both, was found by echocardiography in 3 patients (27.3%). By the end of January 2011, 8 patients had died. Average survival after the start of PD was 31.9 +\/- 22.3 months. Hypertensive nephrosclerosis, a cause less often seen in younger patients, was the most common primary disease among our elderly dialysis patients. As we previously reported, vascular and valvular calcification are important factors for determining prognosis; however, no significant relationships were observed in the present study, probably because almost all the patients had such calcifications.","141":"A practical, inexpensive, and reliable method is needed for the assessment of volume status in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. In the present study, we investigated the efficiency of bioimpedance spectroscopy (BIS) for detection of hypervolemia. The study enrolled 79 prevalent PD patients (mean age: 47 +\/- 14 years; PD duration: 30 +\/- 17 months; 55% men; 19% with diabetes) from a single center. Echocardiography and body composition analysis using the BIS technique [50 frequencies (Body Composition Monitor: Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany)] were performed. Overhydration (OH) and extracellular water (ECW) in liters and OH\/ECW ratio were used as volume indices. The mean left ventricular (LV) mass index was 117 +\/- 37 g\/m2, and 46% of patients had LV hypertrophy (LVH). Mean OH and OH\/ECW ratio were 1.3 +\/- 1.7 L and 7.6% +\/- 9.3% respectively The OH\/ ECW ratio correlated with LV mass index (r = 0.237, p &lt; 0.036) and with left atrium index (r = 0.354, p &lt; 0.001). Compared with patients not having LVH, patients with LVH had higher OH values (1.79 +\/- 1.82 L vs 0.93 +\/- 1.62 L, p = 0.003). In linear regression analysis, the OH\/ECW ratio was an independent risk factor for LVH (t = 2.558, p = 0.01). In PD patients, BIS is a reliable method for evaluating volume status. The OH\/ECW measured by BIS is a major determinant of LV mass. Control of hypervolemia and blood pressure is associated with better cardiac condition.","142":"The newly developed erythropoiesis agent darbepoetin alpha (DA) allows for once-monthly dosing in the treatment of anemia in patients on dialysis. This dosing schedule has prompted some studies to examine the efficacy of DA in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). In the present study, we assessed whether intravenous (IV) administration of DA once monthly is effective for maintaining hemoglobin levels near 10.5 g\/dL in patients on CAPD. This single-center prospective cohort study included 52 clinically stable patients (25 men, 27 women; mean age: 59 +\/- 10 years). All patients had been on a stable weekly or twice monthly regimen of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) before initiation of the study. To determine the monthly dose of DA, the previously used mean weekly dose of rHuEPO was divided by 200 to determine the equivalent weekly dose of DA in micrograms; that number was then multiplied by 4 to generate the monthly dose requirement. For example, if 3000 IUrHuEPO was being administered weekly, then the monthly dose of DA was calculated to be 60 microg (3000\/200 x 4). All patients received a monthly dose of DA the first month, and hemoglobin and other routine laboratory tests were performed monthly for 24 consecutive weeks. In 26 patients, the calculated monthly DA dose remained stable. The monthly dose was increased by 25% in 22 patients and by 50% in 4 patients. With regard to iron stores and iron availability for erythropoiesis, no significant differences were observed in the patients on various doses of DA. Nonsignificant differences in weekly creatinine clearance as determined using the PD Adequest software (Baxter Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) were observed between the groups. No clinically meaningful differences in other laboratory values between the groups were observed. Once-monthly administration of DA is not always sufficient to maintain hemoglobin levels in patients on CAPD when adequate dialysis therapy is not achieved.","143":"Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is a serious complication of long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD). The mortality rate for EPS has been high, primarily because of complications related to bowel obstruction. However recent advances in clinical research have established the pathogenesis and course of the condition and a treatment strategy. The final therapeutic option for EPS is surgical enterolysis, and we have performed 239 surgical procedures in 181 patients and observed favorable outcomes. Of 181 patients opting for surgery 64 (35.40%) died. Death was related to EPS in 33 patients (18.2%), including 14 who died postoperatively. The overall survival rate at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 years after diagnosis was 93%, 83%, 78%, 71%, and 60% respectively. The survival rate for EPS-related death at 1, 2, 3, 5, and 8 years after diagnosis was 95%, 90%, 87%, 81%, and 74% respectively. Median survival after diagnosis, considering death from any cause and death from EPS, was 43.9 months and 35.7 months respectively. In conclusion, we present favorable outcomes with EPS surgery in 181 patients encountered over a period of 17years. These data reconfirm that surgical treatment is essential for EPS patients. Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis may no longer be a fatal complication and can be improved with accurate diagnosis and treatment.","144":"Tuberculosis has been paid more attention in recent years because of the increase in the number of patients with immune suppression-such as those with renal failure. In the present study, we analyzed patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) in our city to determine the prevalence and clinical characteristics of tuberculosis in those patients. Patients who had been on a PD program for more than 3 months were reviewed. Demographic characteristics, primary renal disease, comorbidities, and duration of PD were recorded. With regard to tuberculosis, the timing of the diagnosis, any previous history of antituberculosis treatment, family history, site of presentation, drugs used, drug side effects, and disease outcome were recorded. Among 322 patients from 5 PD units who were reviewed, 4 (1.240%) were found to have tuberculosis. Pulmonary involvement was noted in 2 (50%). The diagnosis was made through microbiology in 1 patient, through pathology in 1, and through clinical and radiologic assessment in the remaining 2. Mild transaminitis was recorded in 2 patients as a side effect of treatment. Of the 4 patients, 2 were cured, 1 died, and 1 was taking ongoing treatment. The prevalence of tuberculosis was significantly higher in the study population than in the general population. In a dialysis population, a diagnosis of tuberculosis is often difficult, and extrapulmonary involvement is more common, as observed in our study. The diagnosis of tuberculosis may be made through non-microbiologic approaches, and temporary transaminase elevations may be seen during therapy.","145":"Peritonitis remains a significant complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Although most patients can be treated successfully with antibiotics and continue PD, the poorest outcomes are noted in patients with peritonitis secondary to gram-negative organisms, which may lead to temporary or permanent technique failure. Biofilm formation may result in. failure of appropriate antibiotic therapy to eradicate infection, necessitating catheter replacement or a switch to hemodialysis. Here, we report the first case of gram-negative peritonitis caused by Xenophilus aerolatus in a 6-year-old boy on continuous cycling PD. This case highlights the importance of close monitoring of clinical response and of collaboration with the microbiologist and microbiology lab in the identification of unusual organisms, their antimicrobial susceptibilities, and their expected characteristics.","146":"In this prospective study we examined the effect of prolonging cultures of peritoneal dialysis fluid to 21 days. The extended culture period did not lead to any new or clinically important findings, although late culture findings were obtained in a small number of cases. Prolonged culture of the effluent does not appear to be necessary, although it can lead to extended duration of antibiotic therapy if time on therapy is guided by the first negative effluent culture.","147":"Peritonitis, the major complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD), is associated with high morbidity and mortality. It is a major cause of hospitalization and transfer to hemodialysis. In the present study, we aimed to identify predictors of hospitalization in PD-related peritonitis and to examine its microbiology profile over time in our unit to determine the best therapeutic approach. We studied all peritonitis episodes that occurred in a 6-year period (January 1, 2004, to December 31, 2009), evaluating whether adequate treatment could be delivered on an outpatient basis. During the study period, 411 patients were on PD, and 229 peritonitis episodes were recorded in 91 patients. Peritonitis were treated according to unit protocol. The average hospital stay was 11.6 +\/- 6.6 days. We observed an increase of Streptococcus (to 19.4% from 7.7%) and a stabilization of coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, S. epidermidis, and S. aureus (from 9.5%, 22.6%, and 3.2% to 7.7%, 30.8%, and 3.8% respectively) peritonitis episodes. The main risk factors for hospitalization were fungal infection, poor 72-hour outcome, inability to perform self-care, and age greater than 80 years. We observed a decline in the incidence of peritonitis, and despite changes in its microbiology profile, no loss of sensitivity to antibiotics used was observed.","148":"Chronic kidney disease (CKD) is associated with a proinflammatory state and an excess of cardiovascular risk. In this work, we describe changes in inflammatory markers-C-reactive protein (CRP), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), serum component of amyloid A (SAA), and procalcitonin (PCT)--in CKD patients compared with a control group of subjects with a normal estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR). Blood samples were obtained from 69 healthy individuals (GP) and 70 end-stage CKD patients--25 not yet on dialysis, 22 on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and 23 on hemodialysis (HD). These were the results [median (95% confidence interval)] for the GP CKD, PD, and HD groups respectively: CRP: 1.40 mg\/L (1.19-2.11 mg\/L), 6.50 mg\/L (3.57-8.32mg\/L), 7.60 mg\/L (2.19-22.10mg\/L), 9.60 mg\/L (6.62-16.38 mg\/L). SAA: 3.10 mg\/L (2.90-3.53 mg\/L), 7.11 mg\/L (3.81-15.40mg\/L), 9.69 mg\/L (5.07-29.47mg\/L), 15.90 mg\/L (6.80-37.48 mg\/L). PCT: 0.03 ng\/mL (0.02-0.03 ng\/mL), 0.12 ng\/mL (0.09-0.16 ng\/mL), 0.32 ng\/mL (0.20-0.46 ng\/ mL), 0.79 ng\/mL (0.45-0.99 ng\/mL). PTX3: 0.54 ng\/mL (0.33-0.62 ng\/mL), 0.71 ng\/ mL (0.32-1.50 ng\/mL), 1.52 ng\/mL (0.65-2.13 ng\/mL), 1.67 ng\/mL (1.05-2.27 ng\/mL). Compared with levels in the GP group, levels of SAA and CRP (systemic response) were significantly higher in CKD patients on and not on dialysis. Levels of PTX3 were higher only in dialyzed patients, significantly so in those on HD (greatly different from the CRP levels). These differing levels might be related to a local reaction caused by an invasive intervention (PD or HD). As eGFR declines and with the start of renal replacement therapy, PCT increases. Levels of PCT could potentially cause confusion when these patients are being evaluated for the presence of infection, and may also demonstrate some microvascular implications of dialysis therapy.","149":"In this study, we compared changes in inflammatory markers-C-reactive protein (CRP), pentraxin 3 (PTX3), serum component of amyloid A (SAA), and procalcitonin (PCT)-in 182 subjects: 69 from the general population (GP), 47 with CKD, 19 with an implanted intra-abdominal catheter for peritoneal dialysis (\"prePD\"), and 47 on peritoneal dialysis (PD). These were the results [median (95% confidence interval)] for the GP CKD, prePD, and PD groups respectively: CRP: 1.40 mg\/L (1.15-2.10 mg\/L), 5.30 mg\/L (3.04-8.06 mg\/L), 3.33 mg\/L (2.15-12.58 mg\/L), 7.25 mg\/L (4.43-15.16 mg\/L). SAA: 3.10 mg\/L (2.90-3.53 mg\/L), 7.77 mg\/L (4.17-15.83 mg\/L), 7.30 mg\/L (4.81-10.96 mg\/L), 9.14 mg\/L (5.31-23.54 mg\/L). PCT: 0.028 ng\/mL (0.022-0.032 ng\/mL), 0.121 ng\/mL (0.094-0.166 ng\/mL), 0.160 ng\/mL (0.090-0.277 ng\/mL), 0.363 ng\/mL (0.222-0.481 ng\/mL). PTX3: 0.54 ng\/mL (0.33-0.62 ng\/mL), 0.71 ng\/ mL (0.32-1.50 ng\/mL), 0.56 ng\/mL (0.44-1.00 ng\/ mL), 1.04 ng\/mL (0.65-1.56 ng\/mL). After catheter insertion, CRP showed a nonsignificant declining trend that disappeared throughout PD. The behavior of SAA was similar to that of CRP and was not modified by the changes induced by the start of PD. An increase in PTX3 was observed only with PD, which may be related to a local proinflammatory state caused by PD solution. We can conclude that catheter insertion for PD does not account for most of the local inflammatory changes observed in PD patients.","150":"Glucose degradation products (GDPs) are highly reactive precursors of advanced glycation end-products (AGEs). High glucose concentrations, GDPs, and AGEs can activate specific pathways, including inflammatory and oxidative stress response pathways, which may adversely affect the cardiovascular system. This review discusses the impact and possible mechanisms of action of GDPs and AGEs with regard to cardiovascular toxicity in chronic kidney disease patients. The AGE-RAGE pathway appears to be particularly important in the pathogenesis of cardiovascular diseases in dialysis patients. In the absence of definitive proof from randomized controlled trials, mounting evidence suggests that high levels of GDPs and AGEs play a role in the pathophysiology of cardiotoxicity.","151":"Glucose or its polymer is usually added to dialysis solution for the development of sufficient ultrafiltration during peritoneal dialysis. The aim of the present study was to determine the influence of glucose and icodextrin on the transport of gentamicin and insulin from the mesothelial to the interstitial side of the peritoneal membrane. Transfer values are expressed as a coefficient of diffusive permeability, P, in centimeters per second. Each of the molecules was tested in 3 series of experiments using rabbit parietal peritoneum, a modified Ussing chamber, and a mathematical model of mass transport. First, transperitoneal transfers of gentamicin (0.040 g\/dL) and insulin (0.1 g\/dL) were analyzed in control conditions for 120 minutes. Then, transport parameters for gentamicin and insulin were separately determined before (15-60 minutes) and after (75-120 minutes or 75-130 minutes) the application of glucose (1.8 g\/dL) or icodextrin (2 g\/ dL) on the mesothelial side of the peritoneal membrane. Insulin transport was observed to be stable in the control series. Gentamicin transfer was not stable; its passage declined by 52% (p &lt; 0.01) in the control series. The mean transfer parameters were 7.41 +\/- 1.40 cm\/s (x0.0001) over 15-30 minutes and 3.21 +\/- 0.54 cm\/s (x0.0001) over 75-130 minutes. Gentamicin transfer declined less in the series with glucose or icodextrin, by 21% (p &lt; 0.04) and 30% (p &lt; 0.05) respectively, than in the control series. For insulin, the mean P (+ standard error of the mean) was 0.15 +\/- 0.02 cm\/s (x0.0001) at the first hour of transfer and 0.14 - 0.02 cm\/s (x0.0001) at the second. Glucose induced a nonsignificant intensification of insulin transport. Icodextrin increased insulin passage by 107% (p &lt; 0.03). Osmotic and oncotic factors (glucose and icodextrin) both stabilize the transfer of gentamicin across the peritoneal membrane in vitro. Glucose polymer intensifies insulin transport from the mesothelial to the interstitial side of the peritoneum. Similar modifications might be observed in vivo during peritoneal dialysis or continuous intraperitoneal administration of insulin, influencing the efficiency of those treatments.","152":"Long-term peritoneal dialysis induces peritoneal hyperpermeability, and the subsequent loss of ultra-filtration causes patients to discontinue peritoneal dialysis. Glucose degradation products (GDPs) in peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDFs) are probably one of the primary causes for peritoneal injury. In the present study, we used a transcriptome analysis to determine the mechanism of peritoneal injury by GDPs. Rats were administered 20 mmol\/L methylglyoxal (MGO) in PDF or 20 mmol\/L formaldehyde in PDF (100 mL\/kg) intraperitoneally for 21 days. The peritoneal membrane in rats that received MGO showed increased thickness and fibrosis. Mesenchymal-like cells over-proliferated on the surface of the peritoneum. A DNA microarray analysis revealed that the expression of 168 genes had increased by more than a factor of 4. The upregulated genes included those that code for extracellular matrix components (such as types III and lV collagen, among others), cell division cycle 42 (Cdc42), an enabled\/vasodilator-stimulated phosphoprotein-like protein [Ena\/VASP (Evl)], and actin-related protein 2\/3 complex subunits (Arp2\/3). In conclusion, a rat model of peritoneal injury by GDPs induced mesothelial cells to redifferentiate and proliferate, with upregulation of Cdc42, the Evl Ena\/VASP, and Arp2\/3, suggesting that GDPs induce fibrous thickening of the peritoneal membrane by redifferentiation of mesothelial cells, resulting in hyperpermeability of the peritoneum.","153":"Long-term peritoneal dialysis leads to encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS), which is a rare but often fatal complication. The pathogenesis of EPS is characterized by increased inflammation, neoangiogenesis, epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT), and fibrosis. Matrix metalloproteinase 2 (MMP-2), which degrades type IV collagen, plays an important role in pathogenesis. Clinical trials report that dialysate levels of MMP-2 can be used as an early marker of peritoneal sclerosis. We aimed to determine the association of MMP-2 with peritoneal function, histology, and effluent cytokine levels in an experimental EPS model in rats. We evaluated data for 71 rats from our various studies using an experimental EPS model. Functional assessment was performed using a 1-hour peritoneal equilibration test with peritoneal dialysis fluid containing 3.86% glucose. Specimens of parietal peritoneum were examined with light microscopy for histologic evaluation. Parietal peritoneum thickness and submesothelial area were measured. Fibrosis, number of vessels, neovascularization, and cellular infiltration were evaluated by one pathologist. The relationships between MMP-2 and other parameters were analyzed using Pearson correlation analysis. Dialysate levels of MMP-2 reflect both functional and histologic change in peritoneum. Levels of MMP-2 were negatively correlated with net ultrafiltration, effluent protein levels, and end (1-hour)-to-initial dialysate concentration ratio of glucose. Cytokines such as vascular endothelial growth factor transforming growth factor beta, monocyte chemotactic protein 1, and osteopontin-which are known to play important roles in neovascularization, inflammation, and EMT leading to fibrosis-were correlated with MMP-2. In peritoneal dialysis patients, MMP-2 levels may be an early marker of EPS and EMT","154":"To clarify the influence of neutral dialysate (ND) on peritoneum, we examined changes in peritoneal permeability and in various markers of the coagulation and fibrinolytic system in effluent and the correlations between peritoneal permeability and those markers in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients using ND. We evaluated 14 patients (8 men, 6 women; mean age: 58.6 +\/- 12.0 years) who started PD using ND. The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was performed to assess dialysate-to-plasma ratio for creatinine (D\/P Cr) as peritoneal permeability. Coagulation markers [thrombin-antithrombin complex, fibrin monomer (FM), prothrombin fragment 1+2 (F1 + 2)] and fibrinolytic markers (fibrin degradation products, D-dimer) in effluent were also measured. At 2 years, FM in effluent was significantly lower (p = 0.006). The other markers and the D\/P Cr did not change significantly. At the initiation of PD and at 2 years, D\/P Cr was significantly correlated with F1 + 2 (r = 0.70 and 0.76 respectively, p &lt; 0.01). Furthermore, multiple regression analysis showed that only F1 + 2 was correlated with D\/P Cr at 2 years (r = 0.79, p = 0.004). These results suggest that ND has little influence on coagulation and fibrinolytic markers in effluent. In addition, F1 + 2 is a useful marker for peritoneal permeability in PD patients using ND.","155":"Bowel bacterial overgrowth syndrome (BBOS) is an important cause of gastrointestinal (GI) abnormalities. Proinflammatory cytokines (PICs) are excessively produced and accumulate because of kidney failure in dialysis patients who experience chronic infections such as BBOS. We explored the association between GL function, BBOS, and the malnutrition, inflammation, and atherosclerosis (MIA) syndrome. We studied GI malabsorption and maldigestion by analyzing fecal starch, sugar, fat, and nitrogen; intestinal protein permeability (alpha1-antitrypsin fecal clearance); and fecal chymotrypsin. We evaluated BBOS by breath hydrogen test (BHT) after a 3-day fat-and-carbohydrate-overload diet. Positive BHT was present in 10 patients, showing a high prevalence of GI macronutrient malabsorption and maldigestion, and compared with the other patients, the highest plasma levels of tumor necrosis factor alpha and interleukin 6 and lower levels of albumin and prealbumin. Those 10 patients were treated with a combination of several antibiotics, including neomycin, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and quinolones. Between 2 and 3 months later, the BHT, markers of nutrition, and PIC were re-tested. All treated patients showed an improvement in nutrition status and a lesser inflammatory pattern. The BBOS infectious process is found frequently in dialysis patients in association with GI malabsorption and maldigestion, malnutrition, and systemic inflammation. Hyperproduction of PIC because of BBOS induces MIA through a double pathway: GI disorders and deleterious systemic effects.","156":"Cardiac disease is a common cause of morbidity in dialysis patients. Traditional and unique risk factors have both been incriminated in the pathogenesis of abnormal cardiac function in these patients. In the present report, we focus on the role of hypocalcemia post parathyroidectomy as a cause of abnormal myocardial function leading to pulmonary edema in a young peritoneal dialysis patient with angiographically-proven normal coronary arteries. The pulmonary edema reversed with correction of the hypocalcemia. Hypocalcemia should be added to the differential diagnosis of contributors to cardiac dysfunction in patients on dialysis. Post parathyroidectomy, patients may be at particular risk for this complication because of severe, protracted hypocalcemia.","157":"In this study, we assessed predictors of bone mineral density (BMD) in chronic kidney disease (CKD) patients with declining renal function. Among the 106 patients enrolled, 26 were treated with peritoneal dialysis [PD: 15 women; age; 55.7 +\/- 17.7 years; dialysis vintage: 16.6 months (range: 6.3 - 45.5 months)]; 60, with hemodialysis [HD: 26 women; age: 54.8 +\/- 15.3 years; dialysis vintage: 36.9 months (range: 6.0 - 279.6 months)]; and 20 were in CKD stage 2 or 3 (11 women; age: 49.4 +\/- 15.8 years). We measured BMD in the femoral neck. Anthropometric measurements assessing nutrition status and routine laboratory parameters were obtained. The femoral neck BMD was 0.842 +\/- 0.137 g\/ cm2 (PD patients), 0.813 +\/- 0.204 g\/cm2 (HD patients), and 0.988 +\/- 0.197 g\/cm2 (CKD patients). In a stepwise backward regression analysis with all patients included, sex, age, body mass index, serum albumin, creatinine, parathyroid hormone, blood pH, and dialysis treatment were significant predictors of BMD (corrected R2 for the model: 0.977), with blood pH being the most powerful predictor (beta = 0.872, p = 0.000). We expect better preservation of BMD in CKD patients more rigorously treated for acid-base imbalance.","158":"Magnesium is one of the most abundant cations in the body and is involved in many cell functions. Serum magnesium concentration is maintained within a narrow range by the kidney and digestive tract. It has been reported that a lower serum magnesium level is a significant predictor for mortality in hemodialysis patients. Body composition and inflammation are important predictors of mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The objective of the present study was to examine the relationship of serum magnesium with body composition and inflammation in PD patients. Our study enrolled 62 PD patients treated at the Long Island College Hospital between November 2000 and July 2008. Demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were recorded. Body composition parameters were determined by bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA). High sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP), a marker of inflammation was measured by the immunoturbidimetric method. In these patients (mean age: 55 years; 63% African American; 55% women; 25% with diabetes), the mean (+\/- standard deviation) serum magnesium and hs-CRP were 1.597 +\/- 0.28 mEq\/L and 13.70 +\/- 21 mg\/L respectively. Serum magnesium was directly correlated with serum markers of nutrition: albumin (r = 0.42, p = 0.001), creatinine (r = 0.43, p = 0.0001), and total protein (r = 0.44, p &lt; 0.0001). Serum magnesium was also directly correlated with phase angle, a BIA parameter and marker of cellular health (correlation coefficient: r = 0.35; p = 0.006), and inversely correlated with the extracellular mass\/body cell mass ratio (r = -0.34, p = 0.008), a highly sensitive marker of malnutrition. We observed an inverse correlation between serum magnesium and hs-CRP (r = -0.37, p = 0.02) in PD patients. In conclusion, lower serum magnesium is associated with poorer nutrition status, deteriorating cellular health, and increased inflammation, which may contribute to the increased risk of mortality in PD patients.","159":"Large body surface area (BSA) could be a pitfall in long-term peritoneal dialysis. We analyzed the viability of the peritoneum in terms of adequacy and technique survival in patients of varying BSA. We grouped our PD patients into three categories (BSA &lt; or = 1.59 m2, BSA 1.60 - 1.79 m2, and BSA &gt; or = 1.80 m2) and used the Student t-test to compare the mean weekly Kt\/V urea between the groups (significance set at p &lt; 0.05). We also measured and used Kaplan-Meier analysis to compare technique survival overall and in anuric patients from the onset of PD to the endpoints of transfer to hemodialysis or death linked to dialysis technique (log-rank test, p &lt; 0.05). Group A consisted of 24 patients [2 men, 22 women; age: 41.9 +\/- 12 years; BSA: 1.49 +\/- 0.07 m2; total treatment duration: 1703.4 patient-months (mean: 71 +\/- 50.6 months); diabetic: 8.33%; anuric: 62%; weekly Kt\/V urea: 2.36 +\/- 0.45; technique survival: 100%, 89%, 89%, 53%, and 53% at 1, 3, 5, 8, and 15 years]. Group B consisted of 35 patients [12 men, 23 women; age: 57.19 +\/- 18 years; BSA: 1.69 +\/- 0.05 m2; total treatment duration: 1870 patient-months (mean: 53.4 +\/- 462 months); diabetic: 17.14%; anuric: 37.14%; weekly Kt\/V urea: 2.28 +\/- 0.41; technique survival: 97%, 93%, 87%, 78%, and 19% at 1, 3, 5, 8, and 14 years]. Group C consisted of 34 patients [24 men, 10 women; age: 56.2 +\/- 13 years; BSA: 1.90 +\/- 0.09 m2; total treatment duration: 1557.5 patient-months (mean: 45.8 +\/- 34.4 months); diabetic: 20.6%; anuric: 41%; weekly Kt\/V urea: 1.98 +\/- 0.38; technique survival: 97%, 79%, 67.6%, 56%, and 28% at 1, 3, 5, 8, and 12 years]. Using the log-rank test, comparisons of technique survival overall and in anuric patients showed for A vs. B, p = 0.49 and p = 0.58 respectively; for A vs. C, p = 0.45 and p = 0.06; for B vs. C, p = 0.56 and p = 0.10. No significant differences in weekly Kt\/V urea were observed between the groups (all p &gt; 0.05). Peritoneal dialysis is viable for patients with a high BSA. There is a tendency toward worse technique survival in anuric patients with a high BSA.","160":"We hypothesized that placement of sterile catheter material into the peritoneal cavity results in a foreign-body response that varies with exposure duration. Sterile medical Silastic catheter material was aseptically implanted into the abdomens of 42 anesthetized Sprague-Dawley rats. Controls (n = 18) underwent sham operations without catheter implantation. After 4, 8, or 20 weeks, the animals were anesthetized, the abdomen was opened, and the catheter material was recovered and processed to separate the cells adhering to the catheters. The cells, abdomen, and catheter material were all cultured to demonstrate sterility, and transport experiments were carried out. After euthanasia of the animals, abdominal wall tissue was examined for submesothelial thickness and vascular density, and immunohistochemistry (IHC) for cytokines was performed. Cells from the catheter material were processed for immunocytochemistry (ICC). The catheter, adherent cells, and abdomen were free of bacteria. Inflammatory changes in peritoneal thickness and angiogenesis were highest at 4 weeks and declined thereafter to 20 weeks. Transport of mannitol was higher at 4 weeks in treated animals than in controls, and albumin transport was higher at 8 weeks in treated animals than in controls. The IHC for cytokines demonstrated changes paralleling the structural alterations (p &lt; 10(-5)). The ICC of the catheter cell layer demonstrated mesothelial cells, macrophages, fibroblasts, and T cells. Over 20 weeks, the foreign-body response to polymer catheters placed intraperitoneally in rats without injection of solution depends on exposure time, with an initial immune response evident at 4 weeks and decreasing thereafter.","161":"Imaging by ultrasonography or scintigraphy may assist in the diagnosis and management of tunnel infections of the peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter. Here, we report a case of tunnel infection in which imaging with positron-emission tomography (PET) correctly predicted failure of conservative management. A 61-year-old man with diabetic nephropathy commenced PD in January 2008. He developed erythema and drainage at the exit site, with negative cultures in February 2008, and frank exit-site infection (ESI) with purulent drainage growing methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus [MSSA (treated with 3 weeks of oral dicloxacillin)] in August 2008. Subsequently, MSSA-growing purulent drainage from the exit site persisted. Systemic antibiotics were not administered, but there was gradual improvement with gentamicin ointment alone. In November 2008, the patient developed partial extrusion of the outer cuff of the PD catheter. In January 2009, a new ESI developed. Despite a week of treatment with cefazolin and gentamicin, the patient still developed his first episode of peritonitis with coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. He then received intraperitoneal vancomycin with good response. Although the ESI appeared to have responded to the treatment, PET imaging showed increased fludeoxyglucose (FDG) activity in the whole abdominal wall portion of the PD catheter. The patient resisted removal of the catheter and had no further signs of infection until June 2009. At that time he presented with exuberant inflammatory tissue (\"proud flesh\") at the exit site. Repeated PET imaging again showed increased FDG activity along the abdominal wall portion of the catheter. The PD catheter was removed and found to be infected. The patient was placed on temporary hemodialysis. This case demonstrates that PET imaging, in addition to other imaging techniques, may be useful for diagnosing and managing PD catheter infections.","162":"Effective immobilization of the peritoneal catheter has repeatedly been associated with positive catheter-related outcomes. This single-center retrospective community study compared infectious complication rates for peritoneal catheters that exit from a highly mobile structure (the abdomen) with rates for catheters exiting from a structure with minimal associated motion (the chest). Data were collected between January 1, 2005, and January 31, 2010. Patients undergoing catheter implantation were divided into two groups: 22 patients with 23 abdominal catheters; 21 patients with 22 presternal catheters. The abdominal and presternal groups were similar, with the exception of catheter experience (410.4 months and 187.2 months respectively), and mean body mass index (BMI--26.2 kg\/m2 and 29.1 kg\/m2 respectively). Catheter-related infections prompted removal of 2 abdominal catheters. No presternal catheters had to be removed. For abdominal and presternal catheters respectively, the rates of exit-site infection were 0.22 episodes\/ patient-year and 0.11 episodes\/patient-year (p = 0.73), and the incidences of peritonitis were 0.41 episodes\/patient-year and 0.27 episodes\/patient-year (p = 0.63). The more effective catheter immobilization on the chest may lower the frequency of infectious complications.","163":"When a patient wanted to change to the Newton IQ cycler with IQcard (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany), several barriers to training presented: fear of training, limited memory, and language barrier. During demonstrations, the nurse spoke slowly and observed body language for cues before introducing the next piece of information. Day 1 featured interruptions by other patients; the patient in training became noticeably nervous and verbalized a fear of learning. Day 2 training was conducted in a more secluded area to ensure privacy. The patient's body language was more open, and recall of information from the previous day was better. On day 3, the patient asked for written instructions in Korean for reference; she chatted more and shared information about her family. On day 4, the patient was animated when greeted by the nurse with a Korean phrase; she practiced setting up the cycler independently. To enhance communication when language is a barrier, provide training in a quiet area free of disruptions; encourage the patient to make notes in the primary language to reinforce and provide written reminder for reference at home; and provide training videos or DVDs to support and enhance instruction. Sensitivity to the patient's culture shows respect and builds trust during training encounters.","164":"The cirrhotic patient with ascites presents unique challenges to the renal caregiver. This patient population has relative contraindications both to hemodialysis (HD) and to peritoneal dialysis (PD). Challenging hemodynamics and the bleeding risk from acquired coagulopathy make HD problematic. In PD, tense ascites can increase the risk of early catheter leak and complicate the initial instillation of dialysate. These patients are at increased risk of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis and would be suspected to have peritonitis rates different from those in non-cirrhotic patients. Ongoing protein losses in the dialysate may aggravate underlying malnutrition. Despite these concerns, available clinical reports suggest that patients with cirrhosis can be successfully managed on PD. The present review focuses on the application of PD therapy in the cirrhotic patient with ascites. Technical aspects of initiating PD are reviewed, and clinical reports, peritonitis risk, and infection control strategies are discussed. Dialysate increases intra-abdominal pressure and may oppose the formation of ascites; the impact of these mechanics on dialysate protein losses and portal hemodynamics are reviewed.","165":"Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is a life-threatening complication of peritoneal dialysis. Few data are available from the United States about the incidence of EPS over time. To examine that question, we retrospectively examined our PD registry, in existence for 30 years, to identify patients with EPS. All other data were collected prospectively. We asked a radiologist to review all computed tomography (CT) scans taken at the time of EPS diagnosis. Incidence of EPS in our 676 patients was 1.2%, but rose to 15% after 6 years, and 38% after 9 years on PD. Peritonitis rates were not high in patients that developed EPS. Scoring of CT scans confirmed the diagnosis of EPS in all patients. Treatment was variable, but in recent years, steroids and tamoxifen were generally used when EPS was recognized. Mortality related to EPS was 38%. Several years after diagnosis, 3 patients are still alive; none is on total parenteral nutrition. In summary, the risk of EPS is low early in the course of PD, but increases progressively at 6 years and beyond. Imaging by CT is useful for diagnosing EPS. Our preliminary results suggest that steroids and tamoxifen are beneficial. Multicenter studies on this serious problem are needed.","166":"Many observational studies have been conducted on the occurrence of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS). However, poorly biocompatible acidic glucose-based dialysis solutions were used in all previous studies. Today, dialysis solutions that are more biocompatible have become widely available. We therefore initiated a new prospective observational study on the occurrence of EPS. The study design is based on that of a previous study conducted in Japan that used solutions high in glucose degradation products (GDPs). Patients undergoing dialysis with a low-GDP dialysis solution, which is considered to show excellent biocompatibility, will be followed for 4 years, and the study will evaluate withdrawal from peritoneal dialysis, incidence of EPS, and factors related to EPS occurrence with the new dialysis solution. This study is expected to clarify the effects of biocompatible dialysis solutions.","167":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is a continuous, slow dialysis method advantageous for retaining residual renal function; however, after renal function is lost, increasing the PD dose is difficult, resulting in insufficient dialysis. The addition of hemodialysis (HD) to PD [combination therapy with PD and HD (PD+HD)] increases the ultrafiltration volume and optimizes the dialysis dose. Based on this situation, we have applied concomitant HD after loss of residual renal function in PD patients. In the present study, we investigated peritoneal function in patients who underwent PD+HD therapy. The subjects were 76 patients in whom PD+HD therapy continued for 6 months or longer. In PD+HD therapy, patients underwent PD 6 days each week and a 4-hour HD session once each week. The patients were divided into four groups based on their dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creatinine (D\/P Cr) in a peritoneal equilibration test (PET) at the initiation of PD+HD therapy: high [H (n = 5)], high-average [HA (n = 29)], low-average [LA (n = 26)], and low [L (n = 16)]. Before and after initiation of PD+HD therapy, we measured PET D\/P Cr values and effluent levels of fibrin degradation products (eFDPs) and cancer antigen 125 (eCA125) in the 4-hour PET effluent. In addition, we evaluated the ratio of overnight effluent to serum beta2-microglobulin (overnight D\/P beta2MG) every year. In the H group, D\/P Cr remained high after initiation of PD+HD therapy, but it declined significantly in the HA group and tended to decline in the LA and L groups. Overnight D\/P beta2MG remained high in the H group after PD+HD therapy, but significantly declined in the HA group and remained unchanged in the LA and L groups. After PD+HD therapy initiation in the H group, eFDPs declined markedly, although that change was not significant. No decrease was noted in any other group. Peritoneal dialysis was discontinued in 33 of the 76 patients (43.4%) who underwent PD+HD therapy: in 5 of the 5 patients in the H group (100%), in 16 of 29 in the HA group (552%), in 7 of 26 in the LA group (26.9%), and in 5 of 16 in the L group (31.3%). On long-term follow-up, the PET D\/P Cr tended to decrease in the H and LA groups; it did not change in the LA and L groups. No significant changes were noted in any group for overnight D\/P beta2MG, eFDPs, or eCA125. We suggest that concomitant HD facilitates the continuation of PD treatment and the retention of peritoneal function in patients with uremic symptoms and excess body fluid associated with a loss of residual renal function. However, improvement in peritoneal function cannot be expected for patients in whom peritoneal function has already deteriorated. In those patients, a change of treatment method should be considered.","168":"The number of elderly patients requiring dialysis therapy has been increasing in developed countries. Among elderly patients on dialysis, the incidence of death from cardiovascular complications has increased. Our objective was to study whether the presence of abnormal cardiac function at the initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) affects the prognosis of patients over the age of 75 years on PD therapy. A retrospective analysis of 46 patients more than 75 years of age who started PD therapy (average age: 79.4 +\/- 3.5 years; 26 women, 20 men) collected demographic and comorbidity data. Survival was defined as time from the initiation of PD therapy. In 12 patients, ejection fraction measured by echocardiography was less than 50% (\"abnormal EF\" group); in 34 patients, ejection fraction was more than 50% (\"normal EF\" group). In the abnormal EF group, 9 patients (75%) survived 12 months; in the normal EF group, 26 patients (76%) survived that long. However, at 24 months, only 2 patients (16%) in the abnormal EF group and 18 patients (52%) in the normal EF group were still alive. Survival was significantly longer in the normal EF group (p &lt; 0.0019). With the exception of serum albumin, other parameters such as age, serum creatinine, and hemoglobin were not significantly difference between the two groups at the initiation of dialysis therapy. Our study demonstrated that cardiac performance at the initiation of PD therapy predicts prognosis in PD patients more than 75 years of age.","169":"Utilization of chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) continues to decline in the United States. Technique failure remains a key factor in this decline. Center size has been associated with technique failure. Afolalu et al. observed that technique failure rates were higher in units with fewer than 25 patients. We wondered if declining CPD utilization rates are reflective of changes in small or large units. Using the 2000 overall census of individual CPD units in Network #1, New England, between January 1, 2000, and December 31, 2008, we divided the units by size: units with fewer than 25 patients, and units with 25 patients or more. The CPD patient population increased to 1264 patients in 2008 from 1238 patients in 2000 (a 2% increase). A total of 85 units provided CPD therapy in 2000, increasing to 95 units in 2008. Of the 85 units in 2000, 11 managed 25 patients or more. By 2008, 8 of those 11 units had experienced a drop in CPD census. In 2000, larger units had been caring for 547 patients in total; in 2008, larger units were caring for a total of 546 patients. In 2000, 74 units had fewer than 25 patients, and smaller units were caring for a total of 691 patients. By 2008, smaller units were caring for 718 patients in total. Our finding that larger units with 25 patients or more experienced an average decline of 34% in CPD census is a major concern. Growth in the total number of smaller units was not associated with overall CPD growth. Further studies are needed to describe the reasons for decline in CPD census noted in most of the larger units.","170":"We previously reported that the level of low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C) was higher in patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) than in patients on hemodialysis (HD). One of the problems associated with reaching the LDL-C target during statin treatment of patients on CAPD is the emergence of laboratory or clinical side effects. The present study evaluated the efficacy and tolerability of daily combined treatment with ezetimibe 10 mg and simvastatin 10 mg in patients receiving CAPD. Our study enrolled 12 CAPD patients who were experiencing adverse effects from statin therapy. Their existing statin therapy was suspended for 1 month (\"washout period\"), and the patients were then shifted to treatment with the ezetimibe-simvastatin combination. The patients were again monitored for adverse events such as asthenia and myalgia during the subsequent 12 months. Body mass index and levels of glycated hemoglobin, fasting plasma glucose, total cholesterol, LDL-C, triglycerides, alanine amino-transferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatinine phosphokinase were also assessed. The combination of ezetimibe and low-dose simvastatin significantly reduced levels of total cholesterol (by a mean of 27%), triglycerides (by 9%), and LDL-C (by 33%) and increased levels of high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (by 15%). In 11 patients (92%), the target LDL-C level of less than 100 mg\/dL was reached. No significant change in weekly creatinine clearance occurred, and no serious adverse effects were observed. No patient developed muscle pain or weakness, and no increase in creatinine kinase was found. Residual renal function declined, although not significantly when compared with initial values. In conclusion, the present study suggests that combined ezetimibe and low-dose statin treatment is a promising approach for safe and effective primary treatment of dyslipidemia in CAPD patients.","171":"Cardiovascular diseases, in their broad spectrum, are collectively the major cause of death in patients on dialysis. The population of patients treated with peritoneal and hemodialysis are not only subject to the traditional risk factors for heart disease, but also to certain uremia-associated risk factors that are unique in this population. Limited data are available on the effectiveness of routine interventions on cardiovascular outcomes in dialysis patients. Because most dialysis patients are excluded from clinical trials, data from randomized controlled trials regarding outcomes in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis are almost absent. The present review discusses some of the major cardiovascular problems in the dialysis population, the impact of those problems on survival, and the available therapeutic strategies.","172":"Coronary artery disease is the number one cause of death in patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD). However,patients with impaired renal function are much less likely than patients with normal renal function to undergo left heart catheterization and coronary intervention. Patients that do receive invasive strategies experience more bleeding and higher rates of ischemic events. In this review, we examine advances in percutaneous coronary intervention--including antiplatelet therapy and drug-eluting stents--and their impact on patients with CKD.","173":"Despite technology advances, prevention of peritonitis remains one of the major challenges in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Several innovative developments have shown an impact on peritonitis rates. Innovative antimicrobial-coated catheter modifications have been introduced, showing promising results in vitro. Topical application of antimicrobial agents such as mupirocin to prevent exit-site infections has been successfully used. New alternative agents for topical exit-site care with reduced potential for antimicrobial resistance are under development. Flushing before fill and avoidance of spiking of solution bags have improved peritonitis rates, as have innovative connectology and double-bag systems. Automated PD seems to be superior with regard to peritonitis rates, although clinical evidence for the benefit is not always conclusive. New PD solutions with neutral pH and low concentrations of glucose degradation products (GDPs) have shown beneficial effects on cell viability and have improved peritoneal host defense. Yet despite advantageous clinical outcomes in some studies, other trials with low-GDP solutions did not show any difference in peritonitis rates. The incidence of peritonitis has markedly improved since the end of the 1980s, but the infection remains a significant complication of chronic PD. Quantifying the role of the many practices and devices in reducing complications is difficult, but their combined effect has clearly improved peritonitis outcomes.","174":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) peritonitis and subsequent relapses are undesirable complications for patients requiring home peritoneal dialysis. Coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS) remain a common cause of peritonitis. Strains of CoNS are emerging that are resistant to cephalosporins. It has been suggested that, if sensitivity testing shows resistance to cephalosporin but the patient is improving on intraperitoneal cephalosporin, then there is no need to change the antibiotic. The rationale for this approach is that the intraperitoneal concentration of cephalosporin is higher than concentrations used in the microbiology laboratory to determine sensitivity or resistance. Previously, we reviewed a smaller number of cases of CoNS and noted that the relapse rate seemed greater for strains with cephalosporin \"resistance\" initially treated with cephalosporins. The present retrospective review looks at the incidence and treatment of CoNS peritonitis reported as resistant to cephalosporins in a large urban PD program between January 1, 2006, and August 31, 2009. During the study period, 200 new cases of peritonitis occurred, 65 of which (32.5%) were identified as CoNS. All were treated empirically with cefazolin (or vancomycin if allergic) for gram-positive coverage and either tobramycin or ceftazidime for gram-negative coverage. Of the 65 CoNS cases, 27 (41.5%) were sensitive to cefazolin; 38 (58.5%) were reported to be cephalosporin-resistant. Of the 38 episodes of CoNS reported as resistant, 10 were treated throughout with cephalosporin, and 28 either started with or were changed to vancomycin. Of the 28 treated with vancomycin only, 2 relapsed, which compares with 4 of 10 who were treated with cephalosporin throughout (Fisher exact test p = 0.03) Our study suggests that, although cephalosporin-resistant cases of CoNS initially resolve with cephalosporin treatment, they are indeed associated with a greater risk of relapse. Patients with CoNS peritonitis reported resistant to cefazolin may benefit from a change to vancomycin to reduce the risk of relapse.","175":"Fresenius Medical Care-North America has developed a neutral-pH version of its Delflex peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution with low glucose degradation products (GDPs): Delflex Neutral pH. The Delflex Neutral pH system stores the PD solution in a dual-chamber bag. The product is admixed by the patient before use. The new design facilitates GDP reduction in two ways. First, GDPs are reduced because the dextrose solution is stored at a pH that minimizes degradation during sterilization and that optimizes dextrose stability over time. Second, the design minimizes generation of acetaldehyde by separating dextrose from lactate during heat sterilization of the product. Mixing the contents of the two chambers before use produces a physiologically compatible pH of approximately 7.0, with minimal GDPs. Analysis of GDP content was conducted by high-performance liquid chromatography. The GDP reduction across all sizes and formulations of Delflex Neutral pH ranged between 74% and 93% as compared with conventional Delflex PD solution. Testing of the new delivery system by prevalent PD patients demonstrated that, with minimal training, patients can obtain a homogeneous PD solution low in GDPs with a physiologically compatible pH of approximately 7.0.","176":"Use of patient-specific drain-phase parameters has previously been suggested to improve peritoneal dialysis (PD) adequacy. Improving management of the drain period may also help to minimize intraperitoneal volume (IPV). A typical gravity-based drain profile consists of a relatively constant initial fast-flow period, followed by a transition period and a decaying slow-flow period. That profile was modeled using the equation VD(t) = (V(D0) - Q(MAX) x t) xphi + (V(D0) x e(-alphat)) x (1 - phi), where V(D)(t) is the time-dependent dialysate volume; V(D0), the dialysate volume at the start of the drain; Q(MAX), the maximum drain flow rate; alpha, the exponential drain constant; and phi, the unit step function with respect to the flow transition. We simulated the effects of the assumed patient-specific maximum drain flow (Q(MAX)) and transition volume (psi), and the peritoneal volume percentage when transition occurs,for fixed device-specific drain parameters. Average patient transport parameters were assumed during 5-exchange therapy with 10 L of PD solution. Changes in therapy performance strongly depended on the drain parameters. Comparing 400 mL\/85% with 200 mL\/65% (Q(MAX\/psi), drain time (7.5 min vs. 13.5 min) and IPV (2769 mL vs. 2355 mL) increased when the initial drain flow was low and the transition quick. Ultrafiltration and solute clearances remained relatively similar. Such differences were augmented up to a drain time of 22 minutes and an IPV of more than 3 L when Q(MAX) was 100 mL\/min. The ability to model individual drain conditions together with water and solute transport may help to prevent patient discomfort with gravity-based PD. However, it is essential to note that practical difficulties such as displaced catheters and obstructed flow paths cause variability in drain characteristics even for the same patient, limiting the clinical applicability of this model.","177":"The determinants of peritoneal transport status in incident peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are not well defined. Comorbidity, inflammation status, race, age, and mesothelial cell mass are some factors correlated with the baseline dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creatinine. Our aim was to define factors in the pre-dialysis period that possibly correlate with baseline peritoneal transport characteristics. Our study included patients starting PD at our center over the last 7 years. These patients should have been followed in our department for at least 1 year before PD start. Demographic and laboratory data were collected at 12 and 6 months before PD start. Protein intake was calculated from 24-hour urine collections. The Davies comorbidity index was scored for the pre-dialytic period. A baseline standard peritoneal permeability analysis was performed within the 6 first months of PD therapy. The mass transfer area coefficients (MTACs) for creatinine and urea were calculated. Of 94 consecutive PD patients, 47 patients (age: 50.7 +\/- 15.2 years) met the inclusion criteria. Mean monthly pre-dialytic decline in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 0.27 +\/- 0.17 mL\/min per 1.73 m2 body surface area, and daily protein intake was 0.77 +\/- 0.19 g\/kg. Baseline MTACs of creatinine and urea were 12 +\/- 3.6 mL\/min and 19.6 +\/- 5.3 mL\/min respectively. No correlation was found between MTAC and any of age, Davies index, protein intake, lipid levels, C-reactive protein, or monthly GFR decline. In our population, we observed no pre-dialytic factor interfering with baseline peritoneal status.","178":"Our study investigated uric acid transport across isolated parietal peritoneum taken from the anterior abdominal wall of white New Zealand rabbits and placed inside a modified Ussing-type chamber. Values for transfer from the mesothelial to the interstitial side of membrane (M --&gt; I) were calculated using the mathematical model of mass transport and are expressed as a coefficient of diffusive permeability [P (in centimeters per second)]. Four separate series of experiments were done. In the first series, we examined uric acid transfer in control conditions (for 120 minutes). In the second and third series, P was calculated before (15 - 60 minutes) and after introduction of p-cresol (0.005 g\/dL) or sodium hyaluronan (0.04 g\/dL) on the M side of the membrane. In the fourth series, transfer parameters were measured before (15 - 75 minutes) and after (90 - 150 minutes) application of sodium deoxycholate (0.104 g\/dL). The dynamics of transperitoneal transport of uric acid were stable. The values of P +\/- standard error of the mean (x0.0001) were 1.936 +\/- 0.324 cm\/s and 2.078 +\/- 0.186 cm\/s. Application of p-cresol on the M side of membrane lowered uric acid transport by 10%. Application of sodium hyaluronan produced no change, but application of sodium deoxycholate increased the transfer of uric acid by 155%. These observations may have clinical importance.","179":"Biocompatible dialysis solutions have been developed to preserve peritoneal membrane morphology and function. Compared with a conventional solution, a combination of glycerol, amino acids, and dextrose in a bicarbonate\/lactate buffer (GLAD) led to less peritoneal fibrosis and fewer vessels in a chronic peritoneal exposure model in the rat. However, no concomitant reduction in small-solute transport was observed. We hypothesized that this result could be attributable to peritoneal vasodilation induced by vasoactive substances such as nitric oxide. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether fast transport of small solutes and proteins induced by exposure to GLAD could be influenced by Ngamma -methyl-L-arginine acetate (L-NMMA), an inhibitor of NO. These investigations used our rat model of long-term peritoneal exposure with chronic renal failure. All rats underwent peritoneal catheter implantation and a 70% nephrectomy. Thereafter, the rats were allocated to 3 groups: 16 weeks of peritoneal exposure to GLAD and L-NMMA, to GLAD only, or to buffer (bicarbonate\/lactate without any osmotic agent). Afterward, a standard peritoneal permeability analysis adjusted for the rat was performed. Subsequently, the rats were euthanized, and tissue samples were obtained for morphometric determinations. No effect of L-MNNA on the transport of small solutes and proteins was found. Also, no effect on morphology was found. Our findings make it unlikely that NO is directly involved, being more in favor of a direct effect of amino acids on peritoneal transport.","180":"Alport syndrome and encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) are both rare diseases. Their joint occurrence is highly unlikely. Two patients at our center with Alport syndrome developed EPS. We therefore hypothesized that Alport syndrome might predispose to the development of EPS and that this predisposition might be reflected in a fast peritoneal transport rate at baseline. We compared the mass transfer area coefficient (MTAC) of creatinine and the clearances of albumin, immunoglobulin G, and alpha2-macroglobulin at baseline and for all subsequent available measurements in four patient groups: EPS patients with Alport syndrome, EPS patients without Alport syndrome, Alport patients without EPS, and long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients without EPS. The transport characteristics were obtained during a standard peritoneal permeability analysis. Between July 1995 and December 2008, 5 of 417 PD patients treated at our center had Alport syndrome as their primary kidney disease, and 13 of the 417 developed EPS. Of those 13 EPS patients, 2 had Alport syndrome. We observed no differences in the baseline transport characteristics of the four groups under consideration. Taking all measures of transport characteristics into account, only the MTAC of creatinine was higher in the two EPS groups than in the other two groups (p = 0.01). We could not confirm our hypothesis that Alport syndrome affects peritoneal solute clearances.","181":"","182":"We checked whether dialysis patients who drink coffee might have a serum lipid profile different from that of nondrinkers of coffee. The study was performed in 30 patients (26 on peritoneal dialysis, 4 on hemodialysis). Group I included patients who drank 1 - 3 cups of coffee daily (140 - 420 mg caffeine) for at least 2 years before the study [n = 11; dialysis vintage: 29.1 months (range: 8.7 - 59.6 months); age: 56.0 +\/- 14.6 years]. Group II consisted of patients who said that they were nondrinkers of caffeinated coffee [n = 19; dialysis vintage: 15.2 months (range: 6.3 - 45.4 months); age: 56.3 +\/- 19.8 years). Serum lipid profile, anthropometric and bioimpedance measurements, and laboratory indices of nutrition and inflammation status were examined. Compared with group II, group I showed higher serum high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (45.1 +\/- 12.8 mg\/dL vs. 37.7 +\/- 6.6 mg\/dL, p = 0.045) and lower low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol (104.7 +\/- 15.7 mg\/dL vs. 139.0 +\/- 41.8 mg\/dL, p = 0.007). Other examined parameters did not differ significantly between the groups, with the exception of serum albumin [4.0 g\/dL (range: 3.1 - 4.3 g\/dL) in group I vs. 3.3 g\/dL (range: 2.9 - 4.4 g\/dL) in group II, p = 0.020]. Adjustment for age and sex additionally showed differences in bioimpedance and anthropometric measurements. Compared with group II, group I showed lower waist and hip circumferences, a lower waist\/height ratio, a lower fat body mass, and a higher lean body mass as a percentage of total body mass. When adjustments were made for age, sex, and fat body mass, differences in lipid profile were nonsignificant. In the overall group, a correlation was seen between lean body mass and total cholesterol (r = -0.487, p = 0.006). Lower LDL and higher HDL serum cholesterol may occur in dialyzed patients who drink coffee not only because of the direct influence of coffee ingredients on serum lipid profile, but mainly because of a more favorable body composition and better protein nutrition in coffee drinkers.","183":"Assuming that nutrition status also influences bone mineral density (BMD) in dialyzed patients, we compared BMD in two groups of dialyzed patients: those with a body mass index (BMI) above 25 kg\/m2 [group I: n = 20; 11 women; 19 on peritoneal dialysis (PD), 1 on hemodialysis (HD); age: 60.9 +\/- 13.6 years; time on dialysis: 19.3 months (range: 6.5 - 45.7 months)], and those with a BMI below 25 kg\/m2 [group II: n = 10; 7 women; 7 on PD, 3 on HD; age: 46.6 +\/- 21.8 years; time on dialysis: 21.3 months (range: 6.3 - 59.6 months)]. Anthropometric indices of nutrition status and body composition by bioimpedance analysis were checked in all patients. We measured BMD in the femoral neck (FN) and lumbar spine by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Laboratory parameters of nutrition, inflammatory status, and Ca-P balance were simultaneously measured. Influence of age and sex on BMD was taken into consideration. The patients in group I were significantly older than the patients in group II (p = 0.035), but they had significantly higher BMD parameters. After regression analysis, which included age, sex, hip and waist circumferences, total body mass, lean and fat body mass, and BMI in all dialyzed patients, age (beta = -0.558, deltaR2 = 0.131, p = 0.003) and total body mass (beta = 0.408, deltaR2 = 0.131, p = 0.024) were the only independent variables that predicted FN BMD, age being the stronger predictor. In dialysis patients, BMI is associated with BMD, but the only important parameter of body composition for predicting FN BMD in this group is total body mass.","184":"Serum albumin levels have been used as a representative marker for morbidity and mortality in the dialysis population. We evaluated the significance of various biochemical values in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with a history of peritonitis. In 51 patients [27 women, 24 men; mean age: 42.6 years (range: 19 - 70 years); average duration of PD: 28.26 +\/- 23.1 months] with history of peritonitis, we recorded serum albumin and cholesterol levels at the beginning of PD, at the last visit (1 month) before the peritonitis episode, and at months 1, 6, and 12 after the peritonitis episode. Routine data from peritoneal equilibration tests were also obtained. Serum albumin showed a significant decline from the basal measurement at the measurements 1 month before and after the peritonitis episode (p = 0.026 and 0.025 respectively). Serum cholesterol levels and dialysate-to-plasma creatinine at hours 2 and 4 revealed no significant alterations at the same time points. The decline in serum albumin relative to the first visit (basal level) may be a factor showing the likelihood of peritonitis. A decline in serum albumin during follow-up may be an indicator for subsequent peritonitis. The absence of a similar decline in serum cholesterol levels (mimicking albumin) may rule out low dietary intake or malnutrition. Pathophysiologic explanations for these relationships are not obvious. If the leading complication of PD is peritonitis, efforts should be focused on improving the factors that influence serum albumin levels.","185":"Together with the obvious increase of elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), utilization of peritoneal dialysis (PD) has declined since the mid-1990s in a number of countries--a decline that is particularly marked in this elderly ESRD population. A major obstacle that affects any dialysis modality in elderly patients is the greater disease burden than is seen in younger patients. However; this factor may be overcome if patients start PD with assistance provided by visiting helpers (nurses or others) or people at home, mostly family members. Assisted PD (aPD) is suitable for; but not limited to, elderly patients who are unable to perform PD for themselves at home. Important considerations of an assisted model of care include frequency of visits, type of health care, and tasks to be performed for the patient at home. Clinical experience worldwide shows that aPD offers acceptable survival for most elderly and disabled patients, with no significant difference in modality-related complications from those seen in self-performed PD. Elderly patients on aPD experience more frequent hospitalizations, with longer hospital stays. Costs of aPD vary from country to country, depending on the frequency of visits and on reimbursement policies. Most authors believe that aPD can be cost-effective when compared with in-center hemodialysis.","186":"Technique survival in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) depends mostly on clearances in relation to body size and residual renal function (RRF). Our clinical impression has been that when RRF fails, larger patients leave CAPD sooner than smaller patients do. Peritoneal equilibration tests (PETs) and 24-hour adequacy evaluations performed in 277 patients in a single center from 1986 through 2009 were abstracted from the existing peritoneal dialysis adequacy database. A PET (using 2 L of 2.5% dextrose dialysis solution) was performed in 272 patients during the first 4 months of dialysis. Every 3 months, the patients brought their 24-hour urine and dialysate collections for adequacy evaluations and had height and weight recorded. Body surface area (BSA), body mass index (BMI), and total body water (TBW) were calculated. There were 1372 adequacy evaluations abstracted. The number of patients gradually declined over time because of death (28%) or transfer to other peritoneal regimens (25%) or to hemodialysis (23%). A small number of patients received a kidney graft (6%) or left CAPD for other reasons (12%); only 6% of patients remained on CAPD after 80 months of treatment. The mean (+\/- standard deviation) PET 4-hour values were 0.652 +\/- 0.128 for dialysate-to-plasma (D\/P) ratio of creatinine (Cr), 0.403 +\/- 0.0969 for 4-hour dialysate-to-initial dialysate (D\/D0) glucose concentration ratio, and 2336 +\/- 211 mL for the drain volume. There was no correlation between PET D\/P Cr and BSA (r = 0.0051, p = 0.934), PET D\/D0 glucose and BSA (r = 0.0042, p = 0.945), or PET drain volume and TBW. The correlations with other size indicators were very poor. None of the large patients (BSA &gt; 1.9 m2, weight &gt; 75 kg, BMI &gt; 25 kg\/m2) remained on CAPD for more than 80 months once they lost RRF. These results confirm our impression that, with declining RRF, larger patients do not continue CAPD as long as smaller patients do.","187":"Cardiac causes account for nearly half of all deaths in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Coronary artery disease (CAD) is present in 38% - 40% of patients starting dialysis. Both traditional and chronic kidney disease-related cardiovascular risk factors contribute to this high prevalence rate. In patients with ESRD, CAD--particularly acute myocardial infarction--is underdiagnosed. Dobutamine stress echocardiography and, to a lesser extent, stress myocardial perfusion imaging have proved useful in screening for CAD in such patients. Coronary artery calcium scoring is less useful. Acute myocardial infarction is associated with high short- and long-term mortality in dialysis patients. Cardiac troponin I appears to be more specific than cardiac troponin T or CK-MB in the diagnosis of acute myocardial infarction.","188":"Diabetes mellitus is the fastest-growing cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among patients requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT). While diabetes mellitus has become the leading cause of ESRD, the number of elderly patients who need dialysis has grown almost exponentially. Most elderly patients with diabetes are treated with hemodialysis; only a small percentage are treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD). Elderly PD patients with diabetes have a lower survival rate than do nondiabetic patients and younger diabetic patients, perhaps because of the increased comorbidity seen in diabetic patients at dialysis initiation. Also, diabetic patients on RRT are at higher risk of developing de novo cardiovascular disease, one of the major causes of mortality. In Canada, survival in elderly diabetic patients undergoing PD is similar to that in hemodialysis patients; in the United States, patients over 45 - 55 years of age with diabetes have experienced higher mortality on PD than on hemodialysis. It is important, however to emphasize that survival on PD in these elderly patients has greatly improved in recent years. Fluid volume expansion may be one of the reasons for the higher mortality in elderly diabetic patients in some countries; but overall, PD remains a viable form of long-term RRT for elderly diabetic patients with ESRD.","189":"In recent decades, echocardiography has evolved into a useful tool in the assessment of cardiovascular anatomy, physiology, and pathology. Its use has enabled the measurement of structural parameters such as left ventricular mass, which has both diagnostic and prognostic value. Doppler measurements have allowed for accurate hemodynamic assessment that can help to guide therapy. Newer methods have also been used and proposed to evaluate systolic and diastolic function. Here, we review the use of echocardiography in cardiac structural and functional assessment, providing insights into the challenges and limitations of these techniques in dialysis patients.","190":"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are at increased risk of cardiovascular events. Echocardiography is an integral part of the evaluation of coronary artery disease. Chronic kidney disease has a predictable and unique effect on the myocardium and the epicardial circulation that may be detected by echocardiography. In particular dobutamine stress echocardiography has proved to be an invaluable tool in the detection of cardiovascular disease in patients with CKD. Here, we review the usefulness of echocardiography in the detection and evaluation of coronary artery disease in patients with CKD.","191":"Patients with chronic kidney disease (CKD) are considered to belong to the highest risk group for the development of cardiovascular events. These patients should be subject to aggressive risk-factor modification. However, management of coronary artery disease in patients with CKD can be uniquely challenging. Many of the medications used in the treatment and prevention of coronary artery disease are metabolized or excreted by the kidney. Thus, patients with CKD are more likely to experience adverse effects from any attempt to aggressively modify risk factors for coronary artery disease. Little is known regarding revascularization in patients with CKD. Patients with CKD may benefit from off-pump strategies during coronary artery bypass. Percutaneous coronary intervention in patients with CKD is associated with lower procedural success and increased peri-procedural myocardial infarction, ischemia, and target vessel revascularization. In this review, we discuss the unique challenges of managing coronary artery disease in patients with CKD.","192":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients seem to maintain a better nutrition status than do hemodialysis patients, and some develop overweight. The clinical relevance of overweight in PD is uncertain. We assessed nutrition status and evaluated the prevalence of overweight in PD patients, and we explored the association of overweight with demographic, clinical, and dialysis factors. The study group included 57 patients (31.5% men; 12.3% with diabetes; mean age: 49.5 +\/- 14.9 years) on PD for 2.9 +\/- 2.7 years. Nutrition status was assessed by subjective global assessment (SGA), body mass index (BMI), and a nutrition status score (NSS) based on biochemical and anthropometric measurements. By SGA, 70.2% of patients were classified as having a normal nutrition status; none had severe malnutrition. Based on the NSS, only 4 patients were identified as mildly-to-moderately malnourished. By BMI, 50.9% of the patients were overweight (BMI &gt; or = 25 kg\/m2). No relationship was found for BMI or NSS with dialysis time, Kt\/V, residual renal function, or peritoneal transport. Similar results were obtained considering only overweight patients. Overweight patients had higher levels of serum albumin (p = 0.014), homocysteine (p = 0.003), and total-to-high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio (p = 0.048). Instead of malnutrition, overweight was highly prevalent in our PD patients. Overweight was not associated with demographic- or modality-related factors, nor with fast transport or markers of systemic inflammation.","193":"During peritoneal dialysis (PD), a significant amount of protein is lost through the peritoneal membrane, and these losses could influence the patient's nutrition status. It has been reported that peritoneal protein loss (PPL) is greater in diabetic (D) patients than in nondiabetic (ND) patients, but the topic is still controversial, and the factors involved are not totally defined. We studied 23 patients on continuous ambulatory PD (12 with diabetes) who had experienced no episodes of infection during the preceding months. We measured peritoneal transport, PPL, proteinuria, and parameters of inflammation and nutrition. Our study was carried out during the first months of PD (2 - 4 months), which coincided with the first evaluation of peritoneal transport. The PPL was higher in D patients than in ND patients (8.4 +\/- 2.2 g vs. 5.7 +\/- 1.7 g daily, p &lt; 0.001), as was proteinuria (3.7 +\/- 2.7 g vs. 0.9 +\/- 0.7 g daily, p = 0.003). In 83% of D patients and 54% of ND patients, peritoneal transport (p = 0.002) was high or high-average. Dialysate-to-plasma creatinine in D patients was 0.77 +\/- 0.12 as compared with 0.66 +\/- 0.09 in ND patients (p = 0.031). Parameters of nutrition and inflammation were normal in both groups of patients and showed no significant differences, except for serum total protein, which was significantly lower in D patients. Ultrafiltration, Kt\/V, and weekly creatinine clearance were similar in both groups. The D patients with a higher PPL had the highest proteinuria values. We conclude that the higher PPL seen in D patients starting PD seems to be related to high membrane transport in these patients. The condition of high transport in D patients could be a result of diabetic microvascular lesions that cause a similar pattern of permeability in the peritoneal and glomerular membranes.","194":"Preservation of residual renal function (RRF) is an important goal in peritoneal dialysis (PD). The present study explored the factors conditioning RRF decline in a PD population. We studied 148 consecutive patients. Age, sex, diabetes, previous renal replacement therapy time and modality [hemodialysis (HD), renal transplantation (RT), or PD first], peritoneal transport, PD prescription [automated (APD) or continuous ambulatory], and peritonitis were investigated as possible determinants of RRF decline. In 22 patients (15%), PD was started after RT. Residual renal function was not significantly different between patients who started PD as their first option and those who started after RT, either at baseline or after 1 year on PD. Baseline dialysate-to-plasma creatinine was also similar between those groups. Transfer from HD was the single significant predictor of baseline anuria [odds ratio (OR): 6.3; p &lt; 0.001). After the start of PD, diabetes was the only predictor of anuria (OR: 2.5; p = 0.02). Age, sex, reason for PD, PD after graft failure, peritonitis, use of APD, and fast transport were not predictors of anuria. Despite slow tapering of immunosuppression, peritonitis-free survival was not shortened in patients who started PD after RT. Diabetes was a determinant of the time course of RRF decline in PD. Peritoneal dialysis after RT failure offered short-term RRF protection that was similar to that seen in PD-first patients.","195":"Our study assessed the influence of mode of dialysis [continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or automated peritoneal dialysis (APD)] on residual renal function (RRF). The study retrospectively examined 30 children [15 on CAPD, mean age: 8.85 +\/- 5.15 years; and 15 on APD, mean age: 10.17 +\/- 3.63 years (nonsignificant)], followed for at least 12 months, for whom these methods were initial mode of treatment. Arterial hypertension was found in 80% of the children on CAPD and in 67% on APD. Parameters that were analyzed included 24-hour urine output; residual glomerular filtration rate (GFR); adequacy based on total weekly Kt\/V urea and creatinine clearance; and hemoglobin, total protein, serum albumin, daily proteinuria, medications used, and causes of end-stage renal disease. After 12 months of decline in urine output, residual GFR was higher in children on APD (p = 0.06, nonsignificant). The difference in adequacy between CAPD and APD was nonsignificant, but a higher volume of dialysate was used in APD (p &lt; 0.01). Proteinuria was present in 9 children on CAPD and in 6 on APD. In CAPD, we observed a negative correlation between the volume of dialysate and duration of treatment (p &lt; 0.01, r = -0.79); in APD, a positive correlation (p &lt; 0.0001, r = 0.89) was observed. In APD, we observed negative correlations between residual diuresis and duration of treatment (p &lt; 0.0001, r = -0.9), serum albumin (p &lt; 0.05, r = -0.6), and volume of dialysate (p &lt; 0.001, r = -0.83). Residual renal function was better preserved in children with a glomerulopathy or a familial or hereditary renal disease than in those with pyelonephritis. Our results suggest that RRF is better preserved in children with a glomerulopathy or a familial or hereditary renal disease, especially in those treated with CAPD. Further studies are needed in larger groups of patients.","196":"The London Health Sciences Centre (LHSC) Peritoneal Dialysis (PD) Program is an active PD program caring for approximately 120 patients. The program strives for optimal patient outcomes and, in doing so, regularly analyzes infection rates. In 2003, the LHSC peritonitis infection rate was 1 episode in 56 patient-months (1:56). Peritonitis rates remained acceptable in 2004 (1:41) and 2005 (1:57). In 2006, the PD team became concerned when the peritonitis rate demonstrated a significant deterioration to 1:31, with a further decline to 1:27 in 2007. Because the latter rate is below the accepted Canadian benchmark of 1:30, the PD team needed to respond to the downward trend. The principles of E. Wagner's chronic disease care model and P. McGowan's patient-provider partnerships theory were used to guide the development of an intervention plan. A significant improvement in the peritonitis rate was demonstrated in 2008.","197":"Peritoneal dialysis catheters have undergone various modifications over time in an effort to reduce technique failure. Complications resulting from the catheter insertion technique can contribute significantly to technique failure. We report one such complication, highlighting the importance of careful surgical technique in ensuring proper catheter placement.","198":"Burnout is a syndrome in which emotional depletion and detachment occur in response to prolonged stress. This pattern has been described in many high-intensity occupations, and the individuals at highest risk of developing burnout appear to be those in intense caregiving roles. Despite the wealth of information from examinations of burnout, there is a dearth of research on burnout in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Little is known regarding the prevalence, treatment, or prevention of burnout in PD patients or their care-givers despite the fact that burnout is a phenomenon that has been anecdotally observed in the PD population for years. Burnout is a potentially significant contributor to technique failure and therefore to patient mortality. Health care providers caring for PD patients should identify the individuals most prone to burnout and assist them to develop coping techniques that enhance their quality of life and prolong their time on PD. This review seeks to apply research on burnout in other fields to the PD population and to aid providers in both preventing and coping with burnout.","199":"The U.S. end-stage renal disease (ESRD) population continues to increase. Adjustment of several drugs administered to dialysis patients is mandatory because of decreased--and sometimes totally absent--renal clearances. Gabapentin, a newer anticonvulsant increasingly used for several other clinical indications, is excreted in the urine unchanged. Its half-life of 5 - 9 hours is increased to up to 132 hours in anuric patients. Excretion of acyclovir an antiviral agent, occurs predominantly through the kidney (glomerular filtration and tubular secretion). Its normal plasma half-life is 2 - 3 hours; dosage modifications are obligatory in renal insufficiency. In 2008, we encountered 2 ESRD patients on dialysis who exhibited significant neurotoxicity with encephalopathy after gabapentin and acyclovir were given at the usual adult doses. Following prompt drug discontinuation and continued daily hemodialysis or peritoneal dialysis respectively, both patients were discharged home, in normal clinical condition, after 3 days. With the increasing ESRD (and CKD) populations, health care providers other than nephrologists will have increasing contact with these patients. Those providers must consider drug dose modifications according to residual renal function. Algorithms for appropriate renal drug dosing are available from various sources. Pragmatic tactics of this kind will avoid significant morbidity and mortality. In addition, this approach will save millions of now increasingly scarce health care dollars.","200":"The natural history of chronic kidney disease (CKD), in general, remains conjectural. Current literature on rates of progression to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) as compared with mortality in CKD shows conflicts. A study of 27,998 patients in managed care reported a 5-year ESRD rate of 20% and a death rate of 50%. In 1666 patients in the Modification of Diet in Renal Disease study, a much higher ESRD rate of 60% after 88 months was reported (four times the death rate); among patients older than 65 years, the death rate approximated the ESRD rate. More than 20 million Americans have CKD [estimated glomerular filtration rate (eGFR) &lt; 60 mL\/min). Annually, approximately 100,000 new U.S. patients develop ESRD, accounting for a casual annual ESRD rate of only 0.5% among the U.S. CKD population. Similarly, this author's anecdotal experience suggests a more benign CKD outcome than is suggested by the two foregoing studies. A 72-month prospective report of an aging cohort of 100 CKD patients, high risk because they all experienced acute kidney injury at study entry, is presented. The finding of an approximately 18% ESRD rate and 13% death rate after 4 years contrasts sharply with the two studies cited earlier. Several factors--prospective as compared with retrospective analysis, varying patient age and other variables, managed care as compared with other care, and other unknown variables--play important roles in CKD outcome. This author agrees with researchers who recently emphasized the heterogeneity of the CKD population. Patient prognosis and management must be individualized.","201":"The durability of the peritoneum as a dialysis membrane is as yet an unanswered question. Peritonitis episodes have an important effect in long-term treatment. To evaluate survival of the peritoneum for dialysis, we analyzed peritoneal failure related to technique dropout because of peritonitis, inadequate dialysis, and ultrafiltration disorders. We retrospectively analyzed data for 89 peritoneal dialysis patients who had been treated for at least 3 months [52 women, 37 men; mean age: 50.91 +\/- 13.72 years (range: 22 - 81 years)] from August 4, 1993, to July 1, 2008. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to measure peritoneum survival, with only a definitive switch to hemodialysis or death from peritonitis, ultrafiltration failure, or inadequate dialysis as endpoints. Total treatment time was 5008 patient-months (mean: 55 +\/- 44 patient-months), and the historical annual rate of peritonitis was 0.37 per year at risk (1 episode in 32.52 patient-months). Of the 89 patients, 19 dropped treatment because of peritonitis and 1 because of ultrafiltration failure. Peritoneum survival was 98.8%, 93.7%, 87.6%, 66.9%, 46.4%, and 33.8% at 1, 3, 5, 8, 10, and 14 years. In the 15 years of our program, peritoneum failure represented less than 1.5% of drop-out causes annually. The peritoneum is a reliable membrane to reach dialysis targets in long-term therapy.","202":"The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative guidelines for peritoneal dialysis (PD) emphasize the need for quality improvement interventions to improve outcomes in PD. Here, we report 17 years experience of initiatives focused on lowering peritonitis rates in a single PD program. This institutional review board-approved retrospective analysis used a PD registry containing prospectively collected data on patient demographics, initial Charlson comorbidity index (CCI), peritonitis, and clinical outcomes, including reasons for transfer to hemodialysis. Periods were analyzed based on quality initiatives: 1990 - 1991, baseline; 1992 - 1995, randomized controlled trial of exit-site infection prophylaxis comparing mupirocin cream applied daily to the exit site with oral cyclical (every 12 weeks) rifampin; 1996 - 1999, compact assist device introduced for spiking on the cycler; 2000 - 2004, randomized controlled trial comparing daily gentamicin cream with mupirocin as exit-site prophylaxis; and 2005 - 2007, gentamicin prophylaxis implemented as routine care (2005) and retraining of all patients (2006). Infection rates and technique failure rates in each period were compared with baseline rates using incident rate ratio analysis. A total of 382 PD patients were evaluated [median age: 50 years (range: 18 - 90 years); 54% women; 19% African American; 36% with diabetes; median CCI: 5 (range: 2 - 14)]. The peritonitis rate declined from 0.5 episodes per year at risk in 1990 - 1991 to 0.25 episodes per year at risk in 2005 - 2007 (p &lt; 0.004). The exit-site infection rate declined from 0.72 episodes per year at risk to 0.1 episodes per year at risk over the same period (p &lt; 0.0001). The percentage of patients transferring to hemodialysis did not change significantly over time (overall 14%, varying from 12% to 17% annually), nor did the mortality rate, which varied from 115 per 1000 years to 171 per 1000 years. We conclude that quality improvement initiatives can reduce infection rates in PD patients.","203":"It is not established whether hospitalizations are more frequent or longer in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) or chronic in-center hemodialysis (HD). Comorbidity is a major factor affecting the comparison of hospitalizations. To account for comorbidity, we compared hospitalizations between the PD and HD periods in 16 patients, 8 of whom were treated by PD first (group A), and 8, by HD first (group B). In group A, causes of renal failure were diabetes (n = 3), primary renal disease (n = 2), systemic disease (n = 2), and hereditary nephropathy (n = 1). Age at onset of PD was 53 +\/- 11 years; duration of PD, 31 +\/- 17 months; and duration of HD, 40 +\/- 33 months. This group had 52 hospitalizations in the PD period and 80 hospitalizations in the HD period. Hospitalization rate (n\/ patient-year) was 2.5 +\/- 2.0 during PD and 3.0 +\/- 3.0 during HD (nonsignificant), and duration of hospitalization (days\/patient-year) was 19.6 +\/- 15.5 during PD and 21.9 +\/- 17.7 during HD (nonsignificant). The three most common causes of hospitalization were peritonitis (27%), other infections (21%), and cardiovascular disease (14%) in the PD period, and HD access problems (35%), infections (16%), and cardiovascular disease (12%) in the HD period. In group B, causes of renal failure were diabetes (n = 4), primary renal disease (n = 3), and hypertension (n = 1). Age at onset of HD was 56 +\/- 10 years; duration of HD, 41 +\/- 19 months; and duration of PD, 60 +\/- 24 months. This group had 82 hospitalizations in the HD period and 76 hospitalizations in the PD period. Hospitalization rate was 3.0 +\/- 2.4 during HD and 1.9 +\/- 2.8 during PD (nonsignificant), and duration of hospitalization was 17.3 +\/- 25.1 during HD and 12.7 +\/- 21.3 during PD (nonsignificant). The three most common causes of hospitalization were HD access problems (40%), cardiovascular disease (19%), and infections (12%) in the HD period, and other infections (36%), cardiovascular disease (19%), and peritonitis (21%) in the PD period. In patients changing dialysis modalities, rate and duration of hospitalizations did not vary between HD and PD. The causes of hospitalization were similar in the HD and PD periods regardless of which modality was applied first.","204":"In addition to local causes--for example, leak of dialysate into an inguinal hernia sac or into the anterior abdominal wall through the track of the catheter for continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD)--scrotal edema in CPD patients may result from generalized volume retention. We present 2 CPD patients with scrotal edema, illustrating the diagnosis and management of the mechanisms of volume retention. A man with hypertensive nephrosclerosis developed isolated scrotal edema 14 months after an uneventful course of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). After repair of a ventral hernia and of a communicating hydrocele, he started continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), plus 2 daytime CAPD exchanges. After 4 months, he again developed isolated scrotal edema, which decreased at night. Peritoneal scintigraphy showed no dialysate leaks, and peritoneal equilibration test (PET) revealed high-average transport with a residual volume above, and an ultrafiltration volume below, the expected range. Abdominal radiography revealed migration of the CPD catheter. Malposition of the CPD catheter with positional retention of dialysate was diagnosed. The patient was treated with nightly peritoneal dialysis and no daytime exchanges. On this regimen, ultrafiltration improved and the scrotal edema disappeared with no recurrence for 5 months, at which point the patient underwent kidney transplantation. A man with diabetic nephropathy developed poor dialysate return, volume gain, and pronounced edema of the scrotum, penis, and both legs soon after starting CAPD. Peritoneal scintigraphy was negative, and abdominal radiography confirmed the appropriate position of the CPD catheter tip in the right lower abdominal quadrant. PET revealed high peritoneal solute transport, appropriate residual volume, and appropriate for the transport category, but relatively low (0.1 L), ultrafiltration volume. He was treated with a change in the CPD procedure to CCPD, plus 1 daytime icodextrin exchange and instruction to reduce salt intake. This patient has remained free of scrotal edema for 6 months. In men on CPD, scrotal edema can develop from generalized volume gain secondary to either CPD catheter malfunction or imbalance between total fluid removal and salt and water intake. Proper interpretation of PET findings is critical in the evaluation of scrotal edema not resulting from internal dialysate leaks in CPD.","205":"Hurricanes Katrina and Rita resulted in massive devastation of the Gulf Coast at Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas during 2005. Because of those disasters, dialysis providers, nephrologists, and dialysis patients used disaster planning activities to work to mitigate the morbidity and mortality associated with the 2005 hurricane season for future events affecting dialysis patients. As Hurricane Gustav approached, anniversary events for Hurricane Katrina were postponed because of evacuation orders for nearly the entire Louisiana Gulf Coast. As part of the hurricane preparation, dialysis units reviewed the disaster plans of patients, and patients made preparation for evacuation. Upon evacuation, many patients returned to the dialysis units that had provided services during their exile from Hurricane Katrina; other patients went to other locations as part of their evacuation plan. Patients uniformly reported positive experiences with dialysis providers in their temporary evacuation communities, provided that those communities did not experience the effects of Hurricane Gustav. With the exception of evacuees to Baton Rouge, patients continued to receive their treatments uninterrupted. Because of extensive damage in the Baton Rouge area, resulting in widespread power losses and delayed restoration of power to hospitals and other health care facilities, some patients missed one treatment. However, as a result of compliance with disaster fluid and dietary recommendations, no adverse outcomes occurred. In most instances, patients were able to return to their home dialysis unit or a nearby unit to continue dialysis treatments within 4 - 5 days of Hurricane Gustav. Hurricane Ike struck the Texas Gulf Coast near Galveston, resulting in devastation of that area similar to the devastation seen in New Orleans after Katrina. The storm surge along the Louisiana Gulf Coast resulted in flooding that temporarily closed coastal dialysis units. Patients were prepared and experienced minimal interruption of dialysis services. Early planning and evacuation in the face of hurricane landfall--lessons learned from Hurricane Katrina in 2005--prevented disruption of treatment.","206":"Exit-site infection (ESI) and peritonitis are the most frequent reasons for catheter removal and patient drop-out from peritoneal dialysis (PD). After a randomized double-blind study showed gentamicin to be superior to mupirocin for exit-site prophylaxis, several dialysis centers including ours switched from topical mupirocin to gentamicin. Our study examined whether the change from mupirocin to gentamicin affected ESI and peritonitis rates. We retrospectively reviewed consecutive charts of patients seen at our PD clinic between January 2003 and December 2007. We noted the rates of ESI and peritonitis in patients who met the study entry criteria. Chart data for the 100 patients that met study entry criteria were evaluated in depth. The ESI rate was 0.002 episodes\/patient-month in the gentamicin group and 0.004 episodes\/patient-month in the mupirocin group (p = 0.45). The peritonitis rate was 0.06 episodes\/patient-month in the gentamicin group and 0.02 episodes\/patient-month in the mupirocin group (p = 0.07). The rate of gram-positive peritonitis was 0.05 episodes\/ patient-month in the gentamicin group and 0.01 episodes\/patient-month in the mupirocin group (p = 0.08). The rate of gram-negative peritonitis was 0.009 episodes\/patient-month in the gentamicin group and 0.008 episodes\/patient-month in the mupirocin group (p = 0.83). We observed no statistically significant difference in the rates of ESI between patients using mupirocin and those using gentamicin for exit-site prophylaxis. Both groups had a very low ESI rate. A trend toward higher peritonitis rates was noted in the gentamicin group, largely as a result of gram-positive bacteria (p value nonsignificant).","207":"Our cross-sectional study included 44 patients (27 men, 17 women; mean age: 57.12 +\/- 16.66 years; mean dialysis treatment period: 3.59 +\/- 2.67 years) on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Of the 44 patients, 21 were using standard solutions (Stay*Safe, ANDY-disc: Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany), and 23 were using biocompatible solutions (Gambrosol Trio: Gambro Lundia AB, Lund, Sweden; Stay*Safe Balance: Fresenius Medical Care). In all CAPD patients dialyzed longer than 6 months, we analyzed levels of interleukin 1beta (IL-1beta), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha), and interleukin 6 (IL-6) in serum and dialysis effluent when patients were free of acute infection-related (CAPD peritonitis, exit-site infection, other acute infections) complications. In a control group of 20 patients with chronic renal failure [CRF (stages IV and V)], we also determined serum levels of the same cytokines. Levels of the inflammatory cytokines were measured using specific commercial ELISA kits (BioSource, Camarillo, CA, U.S.A.). Statistical analysis of the results was performed using commercial statistics software for the PC (Statistica for Windows, rev. 4.5: StatSoft, Tulsa, OK, U.S.A.). Serum levels of LL-1beta and IL-6 were not statistically significantly different between the patients on CAPD, regardless of the type of dialysis the used, and between the patients and the control group with CRF. Serum levels of TNFalpha, unlike those for IL-1beta and IL-6, were statistically significantly higher in patients on CAPD than in the control group with CRF (13.20 +\/- 3.23 pg\/mL vs. 5.59 +\/- 4.54 pg\/mL, p &lt; 0.001, Mann-Whitney test). Serum and effluent IL-1beta levels in patients on CAPD for less than 1 year and more than 1 year did not significantly differ, but effluent IL-6 levels were significantly higher than serum IL-6 levels in both groups of patients, and effluent IL-6 levels were significantly higher in CAPD patients dialyzed for more than 1 year than in patients dialyzed for less than 1 year. Serum and intraperitoneal (IP) levels of the examined cytokines did not significantly differ in patients on standard and biocompatible solutions, but a trend toward lower IP levels of IL-6 was seen in patients on biocompatible solutions. Residual renal function and number of episodes of CAPD peritonitis had no important effect on serum and IP levels of the examined cytokines. Elevated serum levels of TNFalpha and significant local IL-6 production in our CAPD patients indirectly confirmed the importance of peritoneal dialysis (PD) in amplifying the chronic inflammation that substantially depends on duration of dialysis treatment.","208":"Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is an intestinal obstruction syndrome in which peritoneal deterioration and intraperitoneal inflammation result in intestinal adhesions, which are covered with a fibrin capsule and which cause bowel obstruction. Here, we report the case of a patient with EPS suspected to result from the use of icodextrin peritoneal solution. In this patient, peritoneal permeability to high molecular weight solutes and effluent interleukin-6 (IL-6) levels increased after initiation on-to icodextrin solution. The patient developed symptoms of intestinal obstruction accompanied by intestinal edema 30 months after the start of icodextrin and after a peritoneal dialysis (PD) duration of 78 months. He was then diagnosed as being in a pre-EPS state. The use of icodextrin solution was discontinued, and the symptoms of intestinal obstruction improved after corticosteroid administration. Subsequently, he was managed on a combination of PD using glucose solution low in glucose degradation products and of twice-weekly hemodialysis, but he showed enhanced peritoneal permeability and increases in effluent IL-6. After a PD period of 98 months, severe symptoms of intestinal obstruction developed, and enterolysis was performed. The degeneration of the intestinal wall itself was slight, and the adhesions between the capsule and intestinal surface could be readily removed. In this patient, the degree of peritoneal deterioration and capsule formation differed from that of typical EPS. These findings suggest the promotion of capsule formation by icodextrin solution and the involvement of certain inflammatory reactions.","209":"Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is a major and fatal complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). For treatment, the efficacies of steroids, tamoxifen, immunosuppressants, and surgical total intestinal enterolysis have been reported, but the results have not been sufficient. Because treatment after the onset of EPS is limited, a prophylactic therapy is needed. We previously reported that the level of effluent fibrin degradation products (eFDPs) is predictive of EPS. In the present study, we investigated the clinical course of PD cases with high eFDP levels, and the effect of prophylactic steroid therapy against EPS. Between January 2002 and August 2008, we investigated 310 PD patients, of whom 22 had an eFDP level of 30 microg\/mL or more in 4-hour effluent from a fast peritoneal equilibration test (PET). Mean patient age was 62.6 +\/- 11.1 years, and mean duration of dialysis was 42.7 +\/- 45.5 months (range: 1 - 202 months). During a fast PET performed every 6 months, we measured, in 4-hour effluent, eFDPs, cancer antigen 125 (eCA125), and dialysate-to-plasma creatinine (D\/P Cr). In addition, we calculated D\/P beta2-microglobulin (beta2MG) from levels in overnight dialysis effluent and blood. In the 22 cases, the mean eFDP level was 66.6 +\/- 39.2 microg\/mL; the D\/P Cr 0.78 +\/- 0.1; and the D\/P beta2MG 0.45 +\/- 0.2. Steroid (5 - 30 mg daily) was administered to 8 of the 22 patients. In the 8 treated cases, the eFDP level, the D\/P Cr, and the D\/P beta2MG declined, but did not return to normal, and EPS developed in 2 patients. The eFDP level was high when dialysis was introduced, but returned to normal in 2 of the remaining 14 patients. In 1 of the 14 cases, peritonitis developed 5 times, followed by rapid elevation in the eFDP level. The patient with this intractable peritonitis was switched to hemodialysis. The other 11 patients received no steroid therapy. In 1 of these 11 patients, the eFDP level declined, but not in the others. We suggest that active steroid therapy for patients with a high level of eFDPs may prevent EPS development.","210":"We investigated peritoneal leukocyte count (PLC) and culture results for correlations with inflammation, nutrition, microbiologic parameters, and the effects of peritonitis on peritoneal equilibration tests (PETs) and clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The study group consisted of patients who had experienced peritonitis for the first time and who had been on PD for at least 6 months, with a PET performed both before and after the peritonitis episode. Only patients with an increased PLC were analyzed. In the 70 patients analyzed (35 men; mean age: 45.1 +\/- 13.5 years), 7 (10.0%) underwent PD catheter removal, 60 (85.7%) responded well to treatment, and 3 (4.3%) died. Cultures of peritoneal fluid were positive in 25 patients (35.7%), and these patients had a significantly higher PLC than did the culture-negative patients. After the peritonitis episode, C-reactive protein (CRP) increased significantly in affected patients. Residual urine declined after peritonitis. We observed no significant difference in PET results. Clearly, more micro-organisms are present in the peritoneal fluid in patients with a positive culture than in those with a negative culture, meaning that they have severe peritonitis, which responds poorly to treatment. Beyond a consideration of possibly inappropriate culturing techniques, the variations in effluent culture results might reflect geographic or ethnic differences. Positive culture results and a high PLC should be considered risk factors for catheter loss and mortality in PD. Moreover, culture results might show geographic and ethnic differences. In peritonitis follow-up, CRP may be a better marker than erythrocyte sedimentation rate is.","211":"For the period January 2005 to June 2008, we reviewed the rates, causes, and outcomes of exit-site infection (ESI) among 137 consecutive patients [mean age: 51 +\/- 16 years; 17 (12.4%) with diabetes; 76 (55%) on automated PD; time at risk: 240.41 dialysis years; mean follow-up: 20.4 +\/- 13.8 months]. Treatment protocol included mini-laparotomy and Popovich-Moncrief placement method, with presurgical cefazolin prophylaxis and routine prescription of topical mupirocin for the exit site. Oral cotrimoxazole was the initial empirical ESI treatment. A total of 49 patients (36%) experienced 76 episodes of ESI, for a global incidence of 0.31 episodes per year at risk. Gram-positive organisms occurred in 56% of the cases, and gram-negative organisms in 27%. Staphylococcus aureus caused 15 ESIs (0.06 episodes\/patient-year), and only 15% of gram-positive organisms were methicillin resistant. Methicillin-resistant S. aureus were all sensitive to cotrimoxazole. Pseudomonas species caused 11 ESIs (0.04 episodes\/patient-year). Other Enterobacteriaceae occurred at a rate of 0.03 episodes\/patient-year. Fungal ESLs occurred at a rate of 0.004 episodes\/patient-year The ESI cure rate was 96%. In 3 patients, the catheter was removed, but only 2 patients (2.6%) experienced ESI-related peritonitis. Our unit's treatment policy and prophylactic use of exit-site mupirocin resulted in a low S. aureus ESI rate without an alarming incidence of gram-negative or Pseudomonas infections. Routine microbiologic and quality control is mandatory for strategies individualized to the dialysis center.","212":"The peritoneal mesothelium is a barrier to ion transport in peritoneal dialysis. Cimetidine is an H2 receptor antagonist and a potent inhibitor of Na+\/H+ antiporter, which is found in the plasma membranes of various cell types, including mesothelial cells. Recent reports linked Na+\/H+ antiporter stimulation with increasing peritoneal fibroblast proliferation. The aim of the present study was to investigate by means of Ussing chamber experiments the effect of cimetidine on the transmesothelial electrical resistance (R) of isolated visceral sheep peritoneum. Peritoneal samples obtained from adult sheep were collected from the slaughterhouse and transferred in oxygenated Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) solution to the laboratory within 30 minutes of the animal's death. The peritoneal tissue was transferred in a cooled KRB solution (4 degrees C, pH 7.5) bubbled with 95% O2\/5% CO2. A planar sheet of the visceral peritoneum was mounted in an Ussing-type chamber and cimetidine (10(-3) mol\/L) was added to the solution on the apical and basolateral sides. The R was measured before and for 15 minutes serially after addition of the cimetidine. Results presented are the means +\/- standard error of the mean of 12 experiments. Addition of cimetidine basolaterally induced, within 1 minute, an increase in the deltaR of 35.97% +\/- 12.01% (p &lt; 0.05), which returned to baseline after 15 minutes. The action of cimetidine on the apical side of the membrane was similar, with a rapid rise in the deltaR of 47.3% +\/- 16.4% (p &lt; 0.05) and a subsequent decline to control values. The R is inversely correlated with membrane permeability. The results of the present study indicate a rapid action of cimetidine on the permeability of visceral sheep peritoneum, probably through inhibition of mesothelial Na+\/H+ antiporter. The increase in R observed after addition of the cimetidine clearly indicates the existence of Na+\/H+ antiporter on both sides of visceral sheep peritoneum. The clinical implications of our results should be further investigated.","213":"Aldosterone is a key component of the renin-angiotensin-aldosterone system, and spironolactone, an aldosterone receptor blocker, shows beneficial effects in patients with end-stage renal disease and heart failure. The aim of the present study was to investigate by means of Ussing chamber technique the effect of spironolactone on the transmesothelial permeability of visceral sheep peritoneum in vitro. Peritoneal samples from the omentum of adult sheep were collected immediately after slaughter in a cooled and oxygenated Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) solution. Isolated intact sheets of peritoneum were mounted in an Ussing-type chamber. Spironolactone (10(-5) mol\/L) was added apically and basolaterally to the KRB solution. The transmesothelial resistance (R) was measured before and serially for 30 minutes after the addition of the substances. Data present the mean +\/- standard error of 6 experiments in each case. The control R was 19.8 +\/- 0.36 omega x cm2. The addition of spironolactone resulted in a reduction in the R, which became significant on both sides of the membrane within 10 minutes and remained significantly different thereafter. The maximum reduction of R (deltaR%) reached 24.8% +\/- 2.3% (p &lt; 0.01) apically and 26.3% +\/- 3.2% (p &lt; 0.01) basolaterally. Our data clearly show that spironolactone increases the permeability of visceral sheep peritoneum in a lasting manner. Increased peritoneal permeability could result in increased sodium removal, which has acknowledged beneficial effects both in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis and in patients with heart failure. Further clinical studies investigating the effect of spironolactone on sodium removal in peritoneal dialysis are justified.","214":"Charge factors and reactive carbonyl solutes may change peritoneal structure and the transport properties of peritoneum. The aim of the present study to analyze the influence of polycationic protamine and glucose degradation products on the diffusive permeability (P) of peritoneal membrane for urea in vitro. Values for diffusion from the interstitial (1) to the mesothelial (M) side of the membrane and in opposite direction are expressed as coefficients of diffusive permeability. Four separate series of experiments were conducted. In the first experiment, transperitoneal transfer of urea (20 mg\/dL) in control conditions over 120 minutes was analyzed. In the subsequent three experiments, transport parameters were analyzed before (15 - 60 minutes) and after (75 - 120 minutes) the addition of chemical factors (protamine sulfate 5 mg\/dL, glyoxal 10 mg\/dL, methylglyoxal 1 mg\/dL) on the mesothelial side of the peritoneal membrane. Stability of urea transport was observed in the control series (120 minutes). The mean diffusive permeability coefficients (P = standard error of the mean) were 2.293 +\/- 0.211 cm\/s and 2.621 +\/- 0.457 cm\/s (x0.0001) for I --&gt; M and M --&gt; I transfer respectively. Protamine and methylglyoxal did not alter transport, but glyoxal lowered urea M --&gt; I transport by 12% (p &lt; 0.01), with a statistically nonsignificant reduction in opposite direction. Similar modifications are observed in vivo during peritoneal dialysis and may influence the efficiency of renal replacement therapy.","215":"Use of one bag of glucose peritoneal dialysis fluid (PDF) results in the development of a dose-related senescent mesothelial cell phenotype not linked to acidic pH or the presence of lactate buffer. This complication derives mostly from oxidative stress induced both by glucose itself and by glucose degradation products (GDPs). New glucose formulations are offered in dual- or three-chambered bags, keeping the glucose at a low pH. The result is a reduced presence but not complete elimination of GDPs. These formulations have the potential to slow injury to the peritoneal membrane. Icodextrin and amino-acid PDFs, used for one exchange daily, have advantages and drawbacks alike. Icodextrin offers excellent ultrafiltration, but on the other hand, mesothelial cells incubated with this osmotic agent show reduced viability and proliferation and DNA damage. These unwanted effects appear to result from a substantial degree of oxidative stress. An amino-acid-based PDF offers a positive nutritional effect; however its ultrafiltration capability is not higher than an equimolar 1.5% glucose solution. Amino-acid solution appears to be more biocompatible than glucose-based fluid. So far glucose PDF offered in a single-compartment bag is not a biocompatible solution for long-term peritoneal dialysis. Icodextrin does not appear to be more biocompatible than glucose. Amino-acid-based solution is less harmful to the mesothelium, but its usefulness is still limited.","216":"The management of a handful of non renal clinical conditions includes peritoneal dialysis (PD) as a therapeutic tool. Peritoneal lavage after abdominal surgery is still performed in infectious peritonitis and cases of necrotizing hemorrhagic pancreatitis. Use of PD in active psoriasis resulted in approximately 40 papers reporting mostly isolated cases and showing both therapeutic success and failure. That ambiguous picture persisted during controlled studies, and interest in treating psoriasis with PD faded over the last 20 years. As an emergency tool, PD has been also used in the treatment of metabolic crisis resulting from inborn errors of metabolism such as deficiency of any of the five enzymes of the urea cycle and other inherited disorders of organic and aminoacid metabolism such as maple syrup urine disease, citrullinemia, and propionic acidemia. Recent studies have shown that continuous hemofiltration therapies have more effective clearances than PD does. Similar observations were reported for the use of PD in drug poisoning. Peritoneal dialysis is still a valuable tool as a complementary measure in the treatment of hypothermia. Recently, prospective work in patients affected by end-stage congestive heart failure has shown that maintenance PD significantly lowers morbidity and mortality and substantially improves functional capabilities and quality of life in these otherwise terminally ill patients.","217":"","218":"Reports of tumoral calcinosis (TC) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are rare. Reported PD patients with TC also had hyperparathyroidism. A 67-year-old man on continuous ambulatory PD for almost 3 years developed TC of the right wrist and knee and both shoulders and feet. In the 2 years preceding the diagnosis of TC, this patient's serum parathyroid hormone levels were consistently low (17 +\/- 12 pg\/ mL). Hypercalcemia had been found in 32% of the serum samples, hyperphosphatemia in 91%, and elevated Ca x P product in 78% of the samples. At presentation with TC, serum C-reactive protein was elevated, and serum levels of vitamin D compounds were below normal. Four months after the diagnosis of TC, the patient died with a combination of gastrointestinal and retroperitoneal bleeding episodes and septic events. Tumoral calcinosis may develop in PD patients without hyperparathyroidism. Sustained hyperphosphatemia and high Ca x P product are important in the pathogenesis of uremic TC. Elevated indices of inflammation may accompany TC. Studies are needed to identify other important factors in the pathogenesis of TC in PD patients and to evaluate treatment methods.","219":"Variations in results concerning the influence of low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) and antiplatelet drugs (APtDs) on bone mineral density (BMD) have led us to investigate whether dialysis patients receiving these drugs (group I) are characterized by a BMD different from that of patients not receiving such medications (group II). Group I consisted of 14 patients [mean age: 64.7 +\/- 16.0 years; 4 on hemodialysis (HD), 10 on peritoneal dialysis (PD); dialysis duration: 22.7 months (range: 7.9 - 59.6 months)] who were regularly receiving LMWHs (4 HD patients) or APtDs (10 PD patients, 1 HD patient), or both, for at least 2 years. Group II consisted of 16 PD patients [mean age: 48.7 +\/- 16.2 years; dialysis duration: 16.3 months (6.3 - 45.5 months)]. We evaluated BMD as assessed in the femoral neck and lumbar spine, serum parathyroid hormone, blood pH, and parameters of calcium-phosphate balance and nutritional state, and compared values between the two groups. As compared with group II, group I had significantly lower measurements in the femoral neck: BMD (0.711 +\/- 0.100 g\/cm2 vs. 0.904 +\/- 0.124 g\/cm2, p = 0.000), T score [-2.38 (range: -4.06 to -1.27) vs. -0.71 (range: -3.05 to 2.37), p = 0.000], Z score [-1.34 (range: -2.36 to -0.15) vs. 0.12 (range: -1.0 to 2.97), p = 0.001], BMD as a percentage of peak bone mass (69.1% +\/- 9.0% vs. 94.4% +\/- 16.6%, p = 0.000), BMD as a percentage age norm (81.6% +\/- 9.7% vs. 103.4% +\/- 18.5%, p = 0.000). We observed no other significant differences in examined parameters between the groups. Dialysis patients regularly receiving LMWHs or APtDs, or both, show lower BMD measures in the femoral neck; they therefore require more frequent monitoring of BMD and timely prophylaxis against osteoporosis.","220":"Malnutrition is common in dialysis patients. Low serum albumin is associated with increased mortality. Nutrition supplements have been used with success in dialysis patients in increasing serum albumin levels. The National Kidney Foundation of South Carolina Nutrition Supplement Program provides grants for supplements. We studied the effect of supplements on albumin levels in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, hemodialysis (HD) patients, and dialysis patients with diabetes. Dialysis patients with any combination of an annual income of less than $24,000, a documented albumin level of 35 g\/L or under or significant weight loss were provided with 3 months of nutrition supplements. Albumin levels and weight were tracked for 3 months before, 3 months during, and 3 months after the supplement use. The study included 190 patients (157 on HD, 33 on PD). Serum albumin was significantly higher in HD patients than in PD patients during all study periods (before, during, and after supplement; p &lt; 0.05). In the 121 dialysis patients with diabetes, we observed a significant increase in albumin during supplement period (p &lt; or = 0.05). The improvement persisted after the supplement was stopped. Patients on PD had no significant increase in weight or albumin level during or after the supplement period. Nutrition supplements in dialysis patients lead to a significant improvement in serum albumin in HD patients, but no similar improvement in PD patients. Dialysis patients with diabetes had a significant improvement in serum albumin identical to that in dialysis patients without diabetes. Improved serum albumin levels could lead to decreased morbidity and mortality, but the relationship between supplement use and mortality needs further study.","221":"An ongoing problem for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients has been complications associated with an indwelling PD catheter. The indwelling catheter has been through many modifications aimed at reducing complications and providing effective delivery of dialysis solution. In this report, we review four cases of rare complications associated with presternal PD catheters and a brief review of the Tenckhoff, Toronto Western Hospital, and Missouri swan-neck abdominal and presternal PD catheters.","222":"Peritoneal dialysis is the ultrafiltration therapy of choice for the long-term ambulatory management of patients with diuretic-resistant refractory congestive heart failure. Here we report a case of patient with right heart failure, massive ascites, and refractory to medical treatment treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.","223":"The most serious complication of peritoneal dialysis is encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS). The prolonged inflammatory stimuli, fibrogenic cytokine overexpression, and angiogenesis that underlie EPS ultimately result in increased production of fibrous tissue, encapsulating the bowel loops. In recent years, inhibitors of mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) as an alternative agent for calcineurin inhibitor toxicity have been widely used in organ transplantation. These agents have also been used since the 1990s in endovascular medicine for drug-eluting stents because of antiproliferative effects on vascular smooth muscle cells and potent anti-inflammatory properties by direct action on human immune cells. Because of the shared characteristics of EPS and other fibrotic processes, we hypothesized that everolimus, an mTOR inhibitor can reverse the process responsible for the eventual development of EPS. We allocated 32 non-uremic albino Wistar rats to 4 groups: control group, 2 mL isotonic saline injected intraperitoneally (IP) daily for 3 weeks; CG group, 2 mL\/200 g (0.1%) chlorhexidine gluconate (CG) injected IP daily and ethanol (15%) dissolved in saline, for 3 weeks; resting group, CG (weeks 0 - 3), plus peritoneal rest (weeks 3 - 6); and Evo-R, CG (weeks 0 - 3), plus 0.3 mg\/L everolimus in drinking water (weeks 3 - 6). At the end of the study, we performed a 1-hour peritoneal equilibration test with 25 mL 3.86% PD solution, and examined the dialysate-to-plasma ratio of urea (D\/P urea), dialysate white blood cell count, ultrafiltration (UF) volume, and morphologic change in the parietal peritoneum. Exposure to CG for 3 weeks resulted in alterations in peritoneal transport (increased D\/P urea, decreased UF volume, p &lt; 0.05) and morphology (increased inflammation, neovascularization, fibrosis, and peritoneal thickness, p &lt; 0.05). Peritoneal rest has some beneficial effect only on UF failure and dialysate cell count (p &lt; 0.05). However; everolimus was more effective than peritoneal rest with regard to vascularity and peritoneal thickness (p &lt; 0.05). Everolimus has beneficial effects on UF failure, inflammation, and fibrosis. Everolimus may have therapeutic value in the management of EPS.","224":"Two indices of small-solute clearance, Kt\/V urea and creatinine clearance, are widely used as markers of peritoneal dialysis (PD) adequacy. It has become clear, however, that increasing the small-solute clearance above a minimum level does not result in improved long-term PD outcomes. Several other factors may affect optimal dialysis outcome. These include, but are not limited to, ultrafiltration, inflammation, malnutrition, and mineral metabolism. In the present article, we briefly review data regarding the relationships between the foregoing factors and survival on PD.","225":"The primary cause of anemia in dialysis patients is inadequate production of erythropoietin (EPO) by the dysfunctional kidneys. The EPO circulates in plasma and acts on erythroid progenitor cells in the bone marrow to produce red blood cells (RBCs). At the same time, chronic inflammatory diseases reduce the release of iron from storage sites, resulting in low transferrin saturation (Fe+ sat%). Anemia can cause fatigue and heart problems. Two main blood tests measure anemia: hemoglobin (Hb) measures the oxygen-carrying protein in RBCs, and Fe+ sat% measures Fe+ status in the bloodstream. The goal of anemia management is to maintain Hb levels at 11 - 12 g\/dL and Fe+ sat% above 20%.","226":"Serious concerns have been raised with respect to intravenous (i.v.) iron as a potential oxidative stress inducer in chronic kidney disease patients. Oxidative stress has been linked to uremia-related inflammation and endothelial dysfunction. Because i.v. iron promotes oxidative stress and because uremic patients have numerous defects of antioxidant defense unrelated to iron, we hypothesized that i.v. iron administration might increment oxidative stress and consequently endothelial dysfunction. We undertook a pilot study of 8 patients from our peritoneal dialysis (PD) program who were in stable clinical condition. We measured high-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hsCRP), von Willebrand factor antigen (vWFa), and fibrinogen in serum, and several sonographic parameters: left ventricular ejection fraction, left ventricular mass index, carotid intima media thickness, and the presence of carotid plaques. We also used a sonographic methodology to measure endothelium-dependent vasodilation (EDV) and endothelium-independent vasodilation (EIV) in the brachial artery. Three hours after i.v. administration of 200 mg iron sucrose, we repeated the biochemical measurements and the sonographic vasodilation parameter measurements in the brachial artery. None of the biochemical parameters were modified after administration of i.v. iron sucrose [hsCRP: &lt; 0.5 mg\/L (range: &lt; 0.5 - 48 mg\/L) vs. &lt; 0.5 mg\/L (range: &lt; 0.5 - 37 mg\/L), p = 0.46; vWFa: 192% +\/- 39% vs. 189% +\/- 32%; p = 0.40; fibrinogen: 449 +\/- 127 mg\/dL vs. 445 +\/- 128 mg\/dL, p = 0.80). Furthermore, i.v. iron stimulus did not affect either EDV (5.8% +\/- 2.7% vs. 7.8% +\/- 1.9%, p = 0.09) or EIV (15.3% +\/- 2.9% vs. 21.4% +\/- 2.2%, p = 0.11). Our data do not support an acute impact of i.v. iron in our PD patients with regard to endothelial-related biochemical parameters or sonographic vasodilation of the brachial artery.","227":"The influence of ingested coffee on bone mineral density (BMD) and the related risk of pathologic fractures is controversial. We decided to check if dialysis patients drinking coffee may have a BMD different from that of non coffee drinkers. We studied 30 dialysis patients (26 on hemodialysis, 4 on peritoneal dialysis). Group I (n = 11, 5 women) included patients who regularly drank at least 1 cup of coffee daily [dialysis duration: 29.1 months (range: 8.7- 59.6 months); age: 56.0 +\/- 14.6 years]. Group II (n = 19, 13 women) consisted of patients who said that they were nondrinkers of coffee [dialysis duration: 15.2 months (range: 6.3 - 45.4 months); age: 56.3 +\/- 19.8 years]. We examined BMD in all subjects in two sites (femoral neck and L2 - L4 lumbar region) by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry. Serum parathyroid hormone, calcium-phosphate balance parameters, blood pH, serum markers of inflammation, bioimpedance records of body composition, and markers of nutrition were simultaneously evaluated. Compared with group II, group I showed significantly lower L2 -L4 parameters: BMD (0.906 +\/- 0.236 g\/cm2 vs. 1.172 +\/- 0.227 g\/cm2, p = 0.005), percent of peak BMD (78.4% +\/- 18.9% vs. 98.4% +\/- 17.0%, p = 0.006), percent of age norm (82.7% +\/- 18.2% vs. 105.9% +\/- 17.7% p = 0.002), T-score [-2.07 (range: -3.95 to 2.02) vs. -0.51 (range: -2.29 to 4.07), p = 0.020], and Z-score [-1.25 (range: -4.41 to 1.90) vs. 0.26 (range: -1.48 to 4.49), p = 0.006]. Serum albumin concentration was higher in group I [4.0 g\/dL (range: 3.1 - 4.3 g\/dL) vs. 3.3 g\/dL (range: 2.9 - 4.4 g\/dL), p = 0.020]. Our results suggest that regular coffee consumption may contribute to BMD loss in dialysis patients.","228":"Fluid overload is a common complication in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The prognostic importance of enrollment fluid status in long-term PD patients remains to be investigated. The objective of the present study was to investigate the prognostic importance of enrollment fluid status in the long-term survival of PD patients. We enrolled 53 PD patients (mean age: 53 years) from November 2000 to February 2006. On enrollment, demographic, clinical, and biochemical data were recorded. Bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA) was used to determine the fluid status of PD patients, including extracellular water (ECW), intracellular water (ICW), and total body water (TBW). Fluid status was corrected for body surface area (BSA): ECW-BSA, ICW-BSA, and TBW-BSA respectively. Patients were followed to January 2008. The ECW-BSA correlated negatively with albumin, a marker of nutrition (r = -0.53, p &lt; 0.0001). The ICW\/ECW ratio (r = 0.36, p = 0.018) correlated directly and the ECW\/ TBW ratio (r = -0.36, p = 0.019) correlated negatively with creatinine. Patients who survived during the study period had a significantly lower ECW-BSA (8.29 L\/m2 vs. 9.91 L\/m2, p = 0.001) than did those who did not survive. Patients with enrollment ECW-BSA below 9 L\/m2 had a significantly better 7-year cumulative survival (Kaplan-Meier) than did patients with a ECW-BSA of 9 L\/m2 or more (p = 0.019). Using multivariate Cox regression analysis, adjusting for age, race, diabetes, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status, and months on dialysis at enrollment, ECW-BSA was a significant independent predictor of mortality (relative risk: 1.50; p = 0.03). In conclusion, ECW-BSA was a significant independent predictor of long-term survival in PD patients.","229":"Previous reports have shown that N-terminal pro-brain natriuretic peptide (NT-Pro-BNP) is a predictive marker for mortality in both peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients. The aim of the present study was to clarify whether NT-Pro-BNP reflects a specific status in PD patients. We analyzed 40 stable PD patients, allocating them to one of two groups (20 each) according to the median value of NT-Pro-BNP: group A below and group B above 5423 pg\/mL. In group B as compared with group A, red blood cell (RBC) counts, hemoglobin, hematocrit, sodium, chlorine, albumin, and daily urinary volume were significantly lower, and cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) and daily ultrafiltration volume were significantly higher. Patients using icodextrin and diabetic patients showed significantly higher NT-Pro-BNP values. We observed significant correlations between NT-Pro-BNP and RBC count, hematocrit, hemoglobin, sodium, chlorine, albumin, lactate dehydrogenase, CTR, daily urinary volume, and ultrafiltration volume. Multiple regression analysis revealed that increasing CTR and hyponatremia were significant predictors of an increase in NT-Pro-BNP. Our results indicate that increased serum NT-Pro-BNP well reflects anemia status, water balance, hyponatremia, and hypoalbuminemia in prevalent PD patients.","230":"The ultrafiltration (UF) efficiency of peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions, defined as the net UF divided by the amount of carbohydrate absorbed per dwell, has been shown to be higher during long dwells with 7.5% icodextrin solution (Extraneal: Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.) than during those with glucose-based solution (2.5% and 4.25% Dianeal: Baxter Healthcare Corporation), prompting a better understanding of UF efficiency. We used the three-pore kinetic model of PD transport to investigate UF efficiency for single long dwells and various combinations of multiple short glucose-based dwells during automated PD (APD). To demonstrate a practical consequence of the effect of dwell time, we simulated two hypothetical APD prescriptions (A and B) in which fluid with a high glucose concentration was used during either the long day dwell (A: 4.25%; B: 2.5%) or the short night dwells (A: 3 x 1.5% + 1 x 2.5%; B: 4 x 2.5%). Computer simulations showed that higher glucose concentrations and shorter dwell times increase the UF efficiency of a single dwell, and UF efficiency depends on patient transport status. When 24-hour APD therapy was simulated for a low-average transporter, the net UF did not differ considerably (A: 1132 mL; B: 1154 mL), but total carbohydrate absorption was higher when solution with a high glucose concentration was used during the single long dwell (A: 146 g; B: 137 g), resulting in lower UF efficiency (A: 7.8 mL\/g; B: 8.4 mL\/g). We conclude that the UF efficiency of the entire regimen should be considered in prescribing PD therapy. When available, Extraneal provides the best UF efficiency during long dwells. Our simulations suggest that raising the glucose concentration in the short dwells and lowering it in the long dwell is the optimal strategy to maximize UF efficiency during APD when Extraneal is not available.","231":"In the present study, we examined the risk factors and causes for removal of the peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter in patients on continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD). Data were collected from the records of patients who received CAPD therapy from 1995 to 2007 in the Department of Nephrology, Saitama Medical University. During that time, 473 patients were introduced onto CAPD therapy and the PD catheter was removed from 63 patients. Catheters were removed in 30 patients (47%) because of peritoneal infection, in 11 (17%) because of dialysis failure, in 8 (13%) because of neoplasm of the gastrointestinal tract, in 6 (10%) because of perforation of the gastrointestinal tract, in 2 (3%) because of laceration of PD catheter, and in 3 each (5%) because of transplantation and home hemodialysis therapy. Duration of CAPD was 5.6 +\/- 1.2 years. In patients who experienced peritoneal infection, causative organisms were Staphylococcus (mainly methicillin-resistant S. aureus), Candida, Pseudomonas, and non tuberculous Mycobacterium. Failure to continue PD therapy related to dialysis deficiency. All patients were examined for encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) by computed tomography (CT) enhanced using contrast material. In 9 cases in which the CT findings indicated EPS, treatment with oral prednisolone (20 mg daily) was started; the dose was then gradually reduced over 1 year. After removal of the PD catheter, no patient developed EPS. All removed catheters were examined using electron microscopy. The catheters from patients who experienced PD peritonitis revealed biofilm formation; however, no biofilm formation was found in PD catheters removed from patients without infection. Despite appropriate antibiotic therapy, peritoneal infection remains the major cause of PD catheter removal. Biofilm formation might be an obstacle to PD continuation.","232":"In the present study, we examined the association between vascular and valvular calcification and the prognosis of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Data were collected from the records of patients introduced onto CAPD therapy during 1999 - 2006 at the Department of Nephrology, Saitama Medical University. At the start of CAPD, cardiac and vascular echography were used to examine 162 patients (average age: 56 +\/- 5 years; 58 men, 104 women; 43 with and 119 without diabetes) for evaluation of vascular and valvular calcification. Both vascular and valvular calcification were found in 32 patients. Vascular calcification was found in 16, and valvular calcification in 11. Over 5 years, 11 patients suffered from cardiovascular disease (7 with stroke, 4 with myocardial infarction). All of these patients had vascular or valvular calcification at the start of CAPD therapy. We also used Cox hazard analysis to examine values for Ca, P, Ca x P, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), and lipids. None of these values were independent contributory factors for incidence of cardiovascular disease in patients on CAPD. These data suggest the importance of vascular and valvular echography to evaluate patients on CAPD, especially at the start of CAPD therapy. Vascular and valvular calcification are important factors for determining the prognosis of patients on CAPD.","233":"Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is the most serious fatal complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Previous studies have indicated the importance of PD duration in the risk of EPS. Pathologic factors may include proliferative neoangiogenesis of the peritoneum and peritoneal hyperpermeability to macromolecules. Because the main component of EPS capsules is fibrin, early detection of the appearance of fibrin may contribute to preventing EPS. For this purpose, measurement of fibrin degradation products (FDPs) in peritoneal effluent may be useful. We therefore examined the relationship between FDP levels and the development of EPS, and the effect of steroid administration. Our study included 237 patients who had undergone PD between January 2002 and April 2006. Mean duration of PD in these patients was 418.4 +\/- 32.2 months (range: 1 - 149.8 months). The fast peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was performed every 6 months, and simultaneously, we determined the FDP level in the effluent of the 4-hour PET dwell (eFDP). Patients with rapidly increasing eFDP levels were administered prednisolone therapy. We obtained eFDP levels a total of 1335 times in 237 patients. The mean eFDP level was 9.0 +\/- 12.1 ng\/mL (range: 0 - 137.9 ng\/mL), and we found that eFDP was correlated with the dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creatinine (D\/P Cr) on PET, but not with duration of PD. In 16 patients, eFDP was greater than 40 ng\/mL, and D\/P Cr on PET ranged from 0.50 to 0.93. In 7 of these 16 patients, the administration of 5 - 30 mg of prednisolone daily reduced the eFDP level, but not to a normal level, and 1 of the 16 developed EPS. Effluent FDP in a useful marker for the risk of EPS. Our results suggest that intensive prednisolone therapy for patients with high eFDP may forestall EPS development.","234":"We performed total enterolysis in 130 patients with encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) between 1993 and 2007. The postoperative survival rate was 93.1%. However, 33 of the patients (25.4%) required additional surgery for recurrent bowel obstruction. To prevent recurrent bowel obstruction, we investigated various techniques following total enterolysis. In 7 patients, we employed the splinting method, in which the intestinal tract is fixed for 1 week after surgery by the insertion of a long intestinal tube. In 3 of the patients, recurrence was detected within 6 months after surgery. We therefore ceased using splinting. From April 2007, we performed the Noble plication procedure, in which intestine-to-intestine suturing is performed to prevent recurrent bowel obstruction, in 17 patients. None of those patients experienced a recurrence during 8 months of follow-up. In 7 patients showing marked calcification or repeated recurrence, we performed anastomosis of the superior jejunum and transverse colon after adhesiotomy. In 5 patients, excluding 2 with recurrence, improvement was achieved. Total enterolysis for EPS relieved bowel obstruction in most patients. However, after surgery, bowel obstruction recurred in some cases. Thus, strategies to reduce recurrence should be established. Currently, we use total enterolysis and Noble plication as our standard techniques. Further basic and clinical studies regarding EPS prevention and treatment should be conducted.","235":"The Kidney Disease Outcomes Quality Initiative (K\/ DOQI) 2006 recommended a minimum weekly Kt\/V of 1.7 for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients while emphasizing the importance of keeping the patient free of uremic symptoms. We examined a symptom score index [Pittsburgh Symptom Score (PSS)] designed to evaluate uremic symptoms to determine if the score improved in the first year of PD. The PSS is a 10-symptom (fatigue, trouble sleeping, difficulty concentrating, restless legs, change in taste, loss of appetite, nausea or vomiting, pruritus, bone pain, muscle pain or weakness) questionnaire that uses a Likert scale of 0 (none) to 5 (severe). From January 1, 2003, to December 31, 2006, incident PD patients completed the PSS at 0, 3, 6, 9, and 12 months. Patients were excluded from analysis if they had been on PD for less than 6 months or on hemodialysis 6 months or more before starting PD. Prevalences of individual symptoms at 1 year and at baseline were compared using the chi-square test. Differences in PSS at the various time intervals were compared using the sign test. The study included 45 patients [51% women; 31% African Americans; 33% with diabetes; mean age: 58.0 years (range: 30 - 89 years); mean initial Charlson Comorbidity Index: 5 (range: 2 - 11)]. Initial median total score improved to 8 from 12 (p = 0.005) by 3 months, with no further improvement. Improvements occurred in change in taste (p = 0.029 at 3 months), difficulty concentrating (p = 0.04 at 6 months), itching (p = 0.007 at 3 months), loss of appetite (p = 0.009 at 3 months), muscle pain or weakness (p = 0.002 at 3 months), sleep disturbance (p = 0.04 at 9 months), and restless legs (p = 0.026 at 9 months). Fatigue, bone pain, and nausea or vomiting scores were low at the start and did not significantly change over the first year. Significant decreases in symptom prevalence were seen in difficulty concentrating (p = 0.03), change in taste (p = 0.005), loss of appetite (p = 0.04), and muscle pain or weakness (p = 0.02) at 1 year. Initiation of PD results in improvement in the prevalence and severity of most uremic symptoms by 3 to 9 months and is maintained at 12 months. We recommend routine checklist evaluation of symptoms at regular clinical intervals.","236":"In the present study, organisms responsible for peritonitis and their sensitivity to antibiotics were evaluated in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients in Bangladesh. We collected PD effluent from 100 peritonitis cases and sent samples to the laboratory for Gram stain and cytology. Cultures used direct inoculation of PD fluid in plate media and broth media simultaneously. Organisms were isolated by Gram stain in 60% of cases. Cell counts showed a mean of 700 (range: 90-7000) white blood cells per milliliter Plate media yielded 33% growth, and broth media, 67% growth. In continuous ambulatory PD, 77% samples were culture-positive; the organisms isolated were gram-positive bacteria in 41% of cases, gram-negative bacteria in 52%, and fungus in 7%. In intermittent PD, only 43% samples were culture-positive; the isolated organisms were gram-positive bacteria in 18% cases and gram negative bacteria in 82%. Gram-positive organisms (Staphylococcus and Streptococcus species) were sensitive to vancomycin and rifampicin; moderately sensitive to ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and ceftazidime; and resistant to ampicillin, cloxacillin, and cephalexin. Gram-negative organisms (Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species) were sensitive to imipenem and aztreonam, and moderately sensitive to ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, and gentamicin. Pseudomonas species were sensitive to aztreonam and ceftazidime, and moderately sensitive to ciprofloxacin, ceftriaxone, and gentamicin. Gram-negative organisms were predominantly responsible for peritonitis in PD patients, and before culture results are received, combined empiric therapy with vancomycin and imipenem or aztreonam may be started.","237":"Inflammation, fibrosis, and angiogenesis underlie the pathophysiology of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS). The irreversible sclerosis of visceral and parietal peritoneum that characterizes EPS can be seen in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients after long periods on dialysis. Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are the major regulator of key metabolic pathways of various inflammatory responses in fibrosing processes in most tissues. The aim of the present study was to investigate the effect of the PPAR agonist rosiglitazone on the progression and regression of peritoneal alterations in chlorhexidine gluconate-induced EPS in rats. We divided 53 nonuremic Wistar albino rats into 5 groups: control group--isotonic saline 2 mL, injected intraperitoneally (IP) daily for 3 weeks; chlorhexidine gluconate (CG) group--CG 2 mL per 200 g body weight, injected IP daily for 3 weeks; Rozi-P group--CG injection as described, plus rosiglitazone in drinking water (8 mg\/L) for 3 weeks; resting group--CG injection as described during weeks 1 - 3, then peritoneal rest during weeks 4 - 6; Rozi-R group--CG injection as described during weeks 1 - 3, then rosiglitazone in drinking water (8 mg\/L) during weeks 4 - 6. At the end of the study, a 1-hour peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was performed with 25 mL 3.86% glucose PD solution. Dialysate-to-plasma ratio of urea (D\/P urea), dialysate white blood cell (WBC) count, ultrafiltration (UF) volume, and morphology change in parietal peritoneum were examined. Exposure to CG for 3 weeks resulted in alterations in peritoneal transport (increased D\/P urea, decreased UF volume, both p &lt; 0.05) and morphology (increased inflammation, neovascularization, fibrosis, and peritoneal thickness, all p &lt; 0.05). Peritoneal rest had some advantages in UF failure and WBC count only (both p &lt; 0.05). However, rosiglitazone was more effective than peritoneal rest for vascularity and peritoneal thickness (p &lt; 0.05). We suggest that the PPAR agonist rosiglitazone may have a therapeutic value in the management of EPS by inhibiting inflammation and neovascularization.","238":"One of the main goals of dialysis is the control of extracellular volume, because inadequate sodium and fluid removal result in fluid overload and increased mortality. In the present study, we evaluated the roles of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), and the use of icodextrin on sodium removal in 29 patients (n = 18 on CAPD, n = 11 on CCPD). Daily removal of sodium by each modality and dialysis adequacy by Kt\/V and creatinine clearance were evaluated. A significantly higher amount of sodium was removed in CAPD patients than in CCPD patients, although peritoneal dialysis clearances were lower in CAPD, and no difference in daily ultrafiltration was observed between the modalities. In the CAPD group, patients using icodextrin for the long dwell showed significantly increased 24-hour sodium removal (218 +\/- 65 mmol\/L) as compared with patients not using icodextrin (96.3 +\/- 58 mmol\/L, p &lt; 0.001); they also showed increased daily ultrafiltration (1685 +\/- 302 mL vs. 717 +\/- 440 mL, p &lt; 0.001). In the CCPD group, 8 patients were using icodextrin for the long dwell, and they showed significantly increased sodium removal only for the day exchange (43 +\/- 49 mmol\/L) as compared with patients not using icodextrin (-60 +\/- 6, p &lt; 0.001). Hypertension was less common in the CAPD patients than in the CCPD patients. These results indicate that CAPD is a more efficient modality than CCPD for sodium removal. Icodextrin is an effective tool not only for increasing adequacy, but also for removing more sodium in both modalities.","239":"Hyaluronan (HA), an essential component of peritoneal extracellular matrix, participates in restoring peritoneal integrity and remodeling the peritoneum changed by prolonged peritoneal dialysis and repeated peritonitis episodes. The aim of the present study was to compare urea, creatinine, and uric acid transport across the peritoneal membrane in control conditions and after HA application. Experiments were undertaken using rabbit parietal peritoneum and a modified Ussing-type chamber. Values of the transfer directed from the interstitial to the mesothelial side of the membrane (I --&gt; M) and in the opposite direction (M --&gt; I) were expressed as coefficients of diffusive permeability P. Transperitoneal transport in control conditions (for 120 minutes) and transfer parameters before (15 - 60 minutes) and after HA application (2000 kDa, 0.04 g\/dL, 75-120 minutes) were examined. In the control series, stability of bidirectional transport for urea (0.02 g\/dL), creatinine (0.1 g\/dL), and uric acid (0.02 g\/dL) was observed. The values of P +\/- standard error of the mean for I --&gt; M and M --&gt; I transfers were respectively 2.293 +\/- 0.211 and 2.621 +\/- 0.457 for urea, 1.522 +\/- 0.102 and 1.865 +\/- 0.244 for creatinine, and 1.936 +\/- 0.324 and 2.078 +\/- 0.186 for uric acid [all x 10(-4) cm\/s]. Application of HA reduced bi-directional urea transport by a mean of 12%, but did not change the P for creatinine and uric acid. These results show that in vitro HA modifies the dynamics of transport for certain small solutes.","240":null,"241":"Chronic exposure to sterile peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions is associated with microvascular and interstitial changes within the blood-peritoneal barrier (peritoneum). These changes are commonly linked to loss of peritoneal function over time, presumably because of angiogenesis-related increased vascular area. However, the effects on peritoneal microvascular function of chronic peritoneal exposure to PD solutions are unknown. The present study examined peritoneal microvascular function after chronic exposure to sterile PD solution. Six rats underwent permanent catheter insertion under anesthesia. Three rats were treated with approximately 16 mL conventional PD solution daily for 6 weeks; catheter insertion controls received 1 mL saline daily. At 6 weeks, visceral peritoneal microvascular function was assessed in vivo using intravital microscopy. Endothelial cell functions were assessed using messenger RNA (mRNA) gene microarray analysis. In both groups, significant angiogenesis was seen, predominantly in the base of the mesentery. Sensitivity and reactivity of the intestinal visceral peritoneal pre-capillary arterioles (A3 arterioles, 8 - 15 microm in diameter) were decreased in the catheter controls, but not in the chronic PD infusion rats. Chronic catheter presence increased the expression of 18 genes in the controls as compared with 12 genes in the chronic infusion rats. In both groups, expression of fibronectin, integrin-beta, integrin-alpha5, collagen type XVIII-alpha1, and matrix metalloproteinase was enhanced. Endothelial expression of proinflammatory genes (interleukin-1beta, tissue pathway inhibitor, chemokine ligand 2) was enhanced by chronic catheter insertion, but not after chronic PD fluid infusion. Increased expression of genes encoding proteins involved in inflammation and tissue remodeling results from peritoneal catheter-related endothelial cell activation. Chronic exposure of the nonuremic peritoneum to sterile PD solutions overrides the catheter-related endothelial cell proinflammatory phenotype to restore peritoneal microvascular function.","242":"The peritoneal mesothelium is a biologic barrier to water and ion transport. Its functional and structural integrity is crucial for peritoneal dialysis treatment. In vivo studies have shown that corticosteroids increase transcellular water transport and ultrafiltration of the rat peritoneum. In the present study, we used Ussing chamber technique to investigate the effect of dexamethasone on the transmesothelial permeability of the visceral sheep peritoneum in vitro. Peritoneal samples from the omentum of adult sheep were collected in a cooled and oxygenated Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) solution immediately after the death of the animals. Isolated intact sheets were mounted in an Ussing-type chamber. Dexamethasone (10(-6) mol\/L) and its inhibitor mifepristone (10(-5) mol\/L) were added apically and basolaterally, alone and in combination to the KRB solution. The transmesothelial resistance (R) was measured for 1 hour before and serially after the addition of the substances. Data are expressed as mean +\/- standard error of 6 experiments in each case. The control R was 21.5 +\/- 0.42 omega x cm2. Dexamethasone induced a significant reduction of R within 15 minutes, which continued for the entire experiment. The maximum effect (% deltaR) was observed at 30 - 60 minutes after the addition of dexamethasone apically 46.2% +\/- 7.14% (p &lt; 0.01) and basolaterally 35.3% +\/- 7.76% (p &lt; 0.01). Mifepristone acted as an agonist on both sides of the membrane and significantly inhibited the dexamethasone effect. Our findings clearly indicate that dexamethasone rapidly increases the transmesothelial permeability of visceral sheep peritoneum. The rapid effect implicates dexamethasone and probably mifepristone as being involved in a common nongenomic pathway. Further investigation is necessary to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and perspectives of these findings.","243":"","244":"Hypokalemia can result from an absence of cellular redistribution accompanied by low serum potassium levels, which can be secondary to inadequate dietary intake, external losses (for example, through the gut or skin), or renal losses. However, low serum potassium secondary to low potassium ingestion usually occurs after an extended period of low oral potassium intake. Also, increased renal potassium excretion can be the result of magnesium deficiency. As compared with pediatric patients on hemodialysis, patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) are at increased risk of hypokalemia because of the greater filtration of potassium in PD. At the same time, 90% of pediatric dialysis patients under the age of 8 years are on PD.","245":"In the present study, we evaluated and compared serum markers of bone turnover in dialyzed patients with serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) &lt; 100 pg\/mL (LBT group, n = 9), 100-150 pg\/mL (MIX group, n = 6), and iPTH &gt; 150 pg\/mL (non-LBT group, n = 15). Laboratory parameters included iPTH; cyclase activating parathyroid hormone (CAP); osteoprotegerin (OPG); OPG ligand (OPGL); inorganic phosphates; total Ca, urea, and creatinine; alkaline phosphatase activity; and blood pH. Cyclase inactive parathyroid hormone (CIP) was calculated by subtraction of CAP from iPTH. When results were adjusted for sex, age, dialysis modality, and dialysis duration, only CAP and CIP were significantly different between the groups. For the LBT MIX, and non-LBT groups respectively, mean serum values for CAP were 20.3 pg\/mL (range: 6.53-50.7 pg\/mL), 79.3 pg\/mL (range: 53.4-99.0 pg\/mL), and 343.3 pg\/mL (range: 102.1-887.9 pg\/mL) and for CIP they were 7.74 pg\/mL (range: 2.41-48.4 pg\/mL), 50.2 pg\/mL (range: 29.5-68.0 pg\/mL), and 129.0 pg\/mL (range: 62.4-399.0 pg\/mL). In a selection of dialyzed patients, serum CAP and CIP concentrations--but not CAP\/CIP ratio, OPG, OPGL, and OPGL\/OPG ratio--can, like iPTH values, be used to categorize those suspected of having adynamic bone.","246":"Assessment of volume status in patients with end-stage renal disease has long been a problem. Objective tools for estimating dry weight are necessary. The present study was designed to determine if better assessment of volume status could be achieved by measuring brain natriuretic peptide (BNP) and thoracic fluid content (TFC) by bioimpedance. We prospectively surveyed 51 medically stable peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients during their routine visits to our PD facility. There were no exclusion criteria. Clinical volume status was assessed by the attending nephrologist as hypovolemic, euvolemic, or hypervolemic. Once the clinical assessment was complete, plasma BNP concentration was measured. The TFC was determined by bioimpedance cardiography measured in the supine position. Of 51 patients, 19 (37.3%) were considered hypervolemic, 30 (58.8%) euvolemic, and 3 (5.9%) hypovolemic by clinical assessment. As defined by systolic blood pressure &gt; or = 130 mmHg or diastolic pressure &gt; or = 80 mmHg (or both), 57% were hypertensive. The hypovolemic group was excluded from the statistical analysis because of the small sample size. Logistic regression analysis did not show a significant correlation between clinical assessment of volume and BNP (p = 0.76) or TFC (p = 0.39). Our data demonstrate the limitations of BNP and thoracic impedance in helping with the clinical evaluation of volume status in a cohort of chronic PD patients.","247":"In the past, hyperparathyroidism was not generally a major problem in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). However, in conjunction with disturbances in serum phosphate, Ca, and CaxP product, hyperparathyroidism has become a serious problem in the cardiovascular diseases of patients with end-stage renal disease-even patients undergoing CAPD. We retrospectively evaluated the first 5 years on CAPD for 17 patients who started and continued dialysis between April 1995 and September 2003. Of these 17 patients, 3 underwent parathyroidectomy. During their clinical course, all of the patients experienced a decline in residual renal function (RRF) that was significantly negatively correlated with their levels of serum Ca and intact parathyroid hormone. Based on these findings, we suggest that RRF is an important factor for the regulation of Ca-P metabolism in patients on CAPD.","248":"The influence of the type of dialysis on survival of patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is controversial. To compare survival among patients with ESRD receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD), we conducted a prospective cohort study in a single center from April 1995 to March 2005. During that period, 454 patients (161 women, 293 men; mean age: 61.7 +\/- 14.4 years; 46.6% with diabetic nephropathy) were started on HD therapy, and 120 patients (40 women, 80 men; mean age: 54.5 +\/- 11.3 years; 16.7% with diabetic nephropathy) were started on PD therapy; all patients were followed for at least 3 years. The 3-year survival rates were 65% for the HD patients and 81% for the PD patients (p &lt; 0.05). The causes of death in patients undergoing HD were 52% cardiovascular 25% infectious diseases, and 12% cancer; in patients undergoing PD, the causes were 36% infectious diseases, 24% cardiovascular, and 6% cancer Median time from initiation of dialysis to study enrollment was 90 days for HD patients and 180 days for PD patients. Although patients in this study were not randomly assigned to their initial type of dialysis therapy, survival rate was found to be dependent on dialysis type. Moreover, this study suggests the importance of early referral and evaluation of risk factors in individual patients before they are started on dialysis therapy.","249":"In peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, we analyzed the relationship between residual renal function (RRF) and well-known predictors of mortality such as anemia, inflammation, and nutrition. We also investigated possible associations between the foregoing parameters and cardiovascular comorbidity, peritoneal transport rate, statin and antihypertensive treatments, and ultrafiltration volume. Our study enrolled 24 patients (17 men, 7 women; mean age: 56 +\/- 12 years) who had started PD at our hospital between 1998 and 2004. Patients who had been hospitalized or had had peritonitis before the study were excluded. Nutrition status, inflammation, anemia, RRF and dialysis adequacy were assessed after 1-2 months. We found that RRF was positively correlated with normalized protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance (nPNA: r = 0. 52, p = 0. 03) and negatively correlated with C-reactive protein (CRP: r = -0.47, p &lt; 0.01) and peritoneal ultrafiltration (r = -0.42, p &lt; 0.05). Only the nPNA and CRP correlations remained statistically significant on multivariate logistic regression analysis (CRP: r = 0.8, p = 0.011; nPNA: p = 0.013). Moreover, as compared with patients without inflammation, patients with inflammation had significantly lower hemoglobin (Hgb) levels (11.8 +\/- 1.1 g\/dL vs. 13.2 +\/- 1.2 g\/dL, p &lt; 0.02), serum prealbumin levels (27.3 +\/- 8 mg\/dL vs. 36.6 +\/- 9 mg\/dL, p &lt; 0.05), and serum transferrin levels (168 +\/- 34 mg\/dL vs. 202 +\/- 31 mg\/dL, p &lt; 0.05), and a higher erythropoietin resistance index (ERI: 10 +\/- 4 vs. 6 +\/- 3.5, p &lt; 0. 02). We observed no differences in RRF or nutrition status between the patients with high and with low peritoneal transport. Regarding comorbidity, patients with pre-existing cardiovascular disease had higher CRP levels (0.8 +\/- 0.4 mg\/dL vs. 0.4 +\/- 0.4 mg\/dL, p &lt; 0.05) and lower mean Hgb levels (13.3 +\/- 1 g\/dL vs. 14.4 +\/- 1 g\/dL, p &lt; 0.05) than did patients without such pre-existing disease. A strong, predictable association exists between RRF and inflammation and nutrition status in incident patients on PD. Serum CRP is a good indicator of inflammation, which correlates well with nutrition status, anemia, and responsiveness to erythropoietin therapy.","250":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is effective way to preserve residual renal function (RRF) and should be the first-line dialysis option. However, after the loss of RRF, there are limitations to how well PD alone can control the uremic state. Combination therapy with PD and hemodialysis (PD+HD) is the simplest way to deal with these limitations. The general prescription for PD+HD should be 5-6 days of PD and 1 HD session weekly. To determine the adequacy of PD+HD, we adopted the equivalent renal clearance (EKR), first transforming the weekly PD adequacy index (Kt\/V), and then evaluating total clearance from both modalities. However the EKR may overestimate the dialysis dose. To accurately track dialysis dose, we use the total effluent (PD, RRF and HD) sampling method to yield Kt\/Vef and creatinine clearance (CCref). In comparing PD+HD with 7 days of PD alone, we found that weekly Kt\/Vef increased to 2.27 +\/- 0.43 from 1.55 +\/- 0.4, and weekly CCref increased to 60.3 +\/- 9.2 L\/1.73 m2 from 42.0 +\/- 7.7 L\/1.73 m2 (p &lt; 0.001). In addition, the normalized protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance, percentage creatinine generation rate, and percentage lean body mass also increased (respectively) to 0.93 +\/- 0.16 g\/kg from 0. 77 +\/- 0.14 g\/kg daily, to 126.5% +\/- 21.2% from 82.6% +\/- 17.1 %, and to 66.7% +\/- 10.9% from 48.2% +\/- 8.9% (p &lt; 0.001). Protein losses in PD+HD were not different from those in PD alone, but serum albumin increased significantly to 3.6 +\/- 0.3 g\/dL from 3.3 +\/- 0.3 g\/dL, and serum beta2-microglobulin decreased to 23.5 +\/- 11.1 mg\/L from 33.3 +\/- 11.3 mg\/L. The total effluent sampling method can be used to evaluate the dialysis dose in PD+HD. The addition of once-weekly HD improved indices of nutrition, with increases in dialysis dose and serum albumin level. In patients without RRF, PD+HD is recommended as a dialysis regimen to maintain the optimal dialysis dose and good nutrition status without peritoneal deterioration from an increase in the PD fluid volume.","251":"The latest literature describing clinical experiences with peritoneal dialysis solutions low in glucose degradation products (GDPs) is mostly consistent with previous reports suggesting less inflammation, better peritoneal mesothelial mass preservation, a lower rate of decline of residual renal function, and improved patient survival. The data suggest stable peritoneal transport rates, but no definite evidence has yet emerged of superior membrane preservation. Most studies have reported very low peritonitis rates, but without significant differences as compared with rates in patients exposed to conventional solutions. New, appropriately powered randomized clinical trials are needed to confirm the potential benefits of low-GDP solutions and to establish the role of renal function preservation with regard to those benefits.","252":"The information available in the literature regarding pulmonary hypertension (PH) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients is limited. The objective of the present study was to examine the prevalence and characteristics of PH in PD patients. We retrospectively collected the clinical profile, echocardiographic (ECHO) findings, and biochemical data for 36 PD patients for which ECHO findings were available. We compared characteristics between patients with and without PH. We found PH, defined as pulmonary arterial pressure (PAP) &gt; or = 35 mmHg, in 15 patients. The prevalence of PH was 42%. Mean age (+\/- standard deviation) of the patients with and without PH was 58 +\/- 15 years and 52 +\/- 15 years respectively (p = 0.30). Mean PAP of the PH patients was 43.8 +\/- 9.0 mmHg (range: 35-65 mmHg). Patients with PH had a lower ejection fraction than did patients without PH (46.3% +\/- 19.8% vs. 56.5% +\/- 11.8% respectively, p = 0.07). Patients with PH also had a higher prevalence of global hypokinesia (60% vs. 29%, p = 0. 059) and dilated left ventricular chamber (53% vs. 19%, p = 0.03). In PH patients, body mass index (24 +\/- 4.5 kg\/m2 vs. 28 +\/- 5.0 kg\/m2, p = 0.024), normalized protein catabolic rate (0. 78 +\/- 0.21 g\/kg vs. 0.95 +\/- 0.27 g\/kg daily, p = 0.049), and ferritin (226 +\/- 210 ng\/mL vs. 873 +\/- 965 ng\/mL, p = 0.005) were significantly lower and lactate dehydrogenase was higher (264 +\/- 99 U\/L vs. 206 +\/- 79 U\/L, p = 0.06) than in patients without PH. We observed no significant differences in race or sex, incidence of hypertension or cardiovascular disease, or vitamin D analog use between the two groups of patients. During the study period, 60% of PH patients and 38% of patients without PH died (p = 0.19). Values of PAP correlated directly with serum levels of phosphorus (r = 0.44, p = 0.02), CaxP product (r = 0.40, p = 0.04), and parathyroid hormone (r = 0.42, p = 0.03). Of continuous ambulatory PD and continuous cycling PD patients, 21% and 55% respectively had PH (p = 0. 049). In PD patients, PH is highly prevalent and may be associated with higher mortality risk.","253":"To test the feasibility of calculating, in the absence of peritoneal transport studies, the dose (daily drain volume) of continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD) that will produce a high probability of adequate fractional peritoneal urea clearance (Kpt\/Vurea), we randomly separated 619 clearance studies in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with 4 daily exchanges into a derivation (n = 322) and a validation (n = 297) group. In the derivation group, the dialysate-to-plasma urea concentration ratio (D\/Purea) was &lt; or = 0.799 within the lowest 5% of the studies. By the urea clearance formula, a D\/Purea value of 0.799 will produce weekly Kpt\/Vurea values of 1.70 or better if the ratio of the daily drain volume to plasma water (Dv\/V) is &gt; or = 0.304 L\/L. Among the 56 studies in the validation group with Dv\/V values of 0.304 L\/L or more, 52 (92.9%) had weekly Kpt\/Vurea values of 1.70 or better. Assuming a suitable (low) D\/Purea value for a given CPD treatment, it is possible to derive the dose of dialysis (the Dv\/V ratio) that will provide adequate peritoneal urea clearance levels regardless of peritoneal transport characteristics. This method is applicable to the prescription of CPD for patients lacking studies of peritoneal transport. Anuric patients on CAPD with 4 daily exchanges require a Dv\/V value of 0.304 L\/L or better to have a &gt; or = 0.9 probability of achieving a weekly Kpt\/Vurea of 1.70 or better.","254":"Although peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been advocated as a suitable substitution therapy in patients with failure of hemodialysis (HD) blood access, documentation of the performance of PD in such patients is limited. Here, we present an elderly patient with total failure of HD blood access who has had a remarkably successful course on PD. A 78-year-old man with several comorbidities started continuous ambulatory PD after a 3.5-year course of HD complicated by repeated vascular access infections and clotting episodes. These access complications resulted in 8 hospitalizations and led to inability to ambulate following a right femoral shaft fracture sustained in a fall secondary to confusion during an episode of access sepsis, and to superior vena cava (SVC) syndrome following SVC thrombosis after internal jugular catheter insertion. Over approximately 3 years, PD has been very successful in this patient, with 2 early routine episodes of peritonitis and 1 early episode of exit-site infection, control of hematologic and biochemical values, no hospitalizations in the 2.5 years before the time of writing, and good quality of life. A dedicated spouse performing the PD tasks has been a major factor in the success of PD in this patient. Peritoneal dialysis can be successful as a renal replacement procedure in incapacitated elderly patients with failure of HD blood access. In these cases, the success of PD is enhanced by dedicated family members taking on PD tasks that the patient cannot perform.","255":"The goal of the present case report is to enhance recognition of the incidence of tissue calcifications, which are quite common in patients with end-stage renal disease. We focus on pulmonary metastatic calcifications and the potential progression of this condition to tissue necrosis and lung cavitations in the setting of severe electrolyte imbalance. This case highlights the importance of early identification of the causes and potential risk factors leading to visceral calciphylaxis.","256":"Peritoneal sclerosis (PS) is a severe complication of long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD). We therefore investigated whether longitudinal analysis of solute and fluid transport preceding a diagnosis of PS could predict its development. We reviewed all standard peritoneal permeability analyses (SPAs) performed with 3.86% glucose and completed before a diagnosis of PS in all patients (n = 11) in whom that diagnosis was made in our center between 1995 and 2006. Most patients had 4 SPAs available. A linear mixed-model procedure was used to analyze the trends. Transport of small-solutes showed significant inverse U-shaped trends before a diagnosis of PS. This trend held for the mass transport area coefficients of creatinine, urea, and urate (all p &lt; 0.05) and for their dialysate-to-plasma ratios (all p &lt; 0. 001). Net ultrafiltration and free water transport at 60 minutes showed significant downward linear trends (both p &lt; or = 0. 01). This U-shaped trend in small-solute transport combined with an ongoing decrease in net ultrafiltration and free water transport might be a warning sign of the development of PS. It underlines the importance of regular assessment of peritoneal function with 3.86% peritoneal equilibration tests in every PD patient-not only those at risk for peritoneal membrane failure.","257":"Initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) induces several changes both locally in the peritoneum and systemically. We performed a pilot study to generate insights into the early clinical and systemic changes after catheter insertion and the first weeks of PD. The study included 11 new PD patients (7 men, 4 women). The study period started just before implantation of the Tenckhoff catheter and finished 6 weeks after the start of PD. All patients were treated with lactate-buffered dialysis solutions. Clinical parameters, routine laboratory tests and markers of systemic inflammation were determined. The mean (+\/- standard deviation) age of the patients was 52.6 +\/- 12.1 years, mean weight was 81.3 +\/- 14.7 kg, and mean blood pressure was 143.3\/ 87.8 +\/- 18.5\/8.2 mmHg. Weight and blood pressure did not change significantly during the first weeks of PD. Throughout the study, 24-hour urine production declined by 6.9 mL\/day (p = 0.006). Daily residual creatinine clearance (CCr) decreased by 0.036 mL\/min (p = 0.008). High-sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) was significantly higher in patients who had undergone hemodialysis before the start of the study (p &lt; 0. 0001) and declined during the study in that group (p = 0.001). No significant change in hs-CRP was found in the group that started dialysis with PD. In this pilot study, we found no significant changes in the clinical parameters of weight and blood pressure during the first weeks of PD. However, urine production and residual CCr declined significantly during the study period, starting from the moment of catheter insertion. Levels of the systemic inflammatory marker hs-CRP were higher in patients who had previously undergone hemodialysis; its level in those patients decreased after hemodialysis ended.","258":"Residual renal function (RRF) is a key element for good maintenance of patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Several reports have been published comparing RRF preservation between continuous ambulatory PD and automated PD (APD); however, no comparisons have yet been made between tidal and non tidal APD. We therefore retrospectively analyzed RRF in patients on tidal (n = 10) and non tidal (n = 19) APD and tried to elucidate factors that differed between them. We observed no statistical differences in background, body mass index, RRF urinary volume, peritoneal clearance, ultrafiltration (UF) volume, daily infusion volume, creatinine generation rate (CGR), or urea generation rate between the two groups at that start of PD. However, after 3 years, renal creatinine clearance (CCr) and urinary output in the tidal group were statistically higher than those in the non tidal group. Conversely, UF and peritoneal CCr were lower. Although the CGR in the tidal group increased, it decreased in the non tidal group, leading to a statistically significant difference after 3 years. The dialysate-to-plasma creatinine and total CCr showed no statistical difference between the two groups. These results indicate that RRF is better preserved in tidal than in non tidal APD.","259":"Cardiovascular complications are the major cause of mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Some reports show that ultrasonographic parameters for cardiovascular remodeling predict mortality in ESRD patients as well as in the general population. In the present study, we compared long-term longitudinal changes in cardiac parameters between elderly patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and those on hemodialysis (HD). We analyzed 19 HD and 7 PD patients who were more than 75 years old at the start of dialysis and who had been treated with the same dialysis modality for more than 4 years. We compared ultrasonographic cardiovascular parameters such as left ventricular mass index (LVMI), left ventricular wall thickness (LVWT), intima media thickness and intima media area (IMA) over the 4 years of PD and HD treatment. As compared with values at the start of dialysis, values for LVMI, LVWT, and IMA were significantly elevated in HD patients after 4 years of treatment. In PD patients, we observed no changes in those parameters over time. Our findings indicate that cardiovascular remodeling is liable to deteriorate in elderly patients on HD, but that cardiac parameters in PD patients remain rather stable.","260":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter survival is challenging because of infection and malfunction. The swan-neck presternal catheter has a coiled intra-abdominal segment with a bead and a flanged cuff at the peritoneum; a titanium adapter joins the abdominal segment to the upper segment. The upper segment has two cuffs, one on either side of the presternal swan-neck segment. The present study evaluated the survival of Missouri presternal swan-neck PD catheters implanted at the University of Missouri--Columbia and followed at Dialysis Clinics, Inc., through 2006. Catheter type and insertion date were prospectively recorded. Survival was defined as the interval from insertion date to date of removal, censoring, or analysis. Catheters were censored for transplant, death, or transfer to another unit. A total of 131 presternal catheters were implanted in 129 patients. Mean patient age was 60.9 +\/- 16.3 years. No catheters were removed during the first 3 months for either infection or technical problems. One catheter was removed at 6 months for malposition and another at 2 years for an external leak; all other catheter losses were attributable to peritonitis. Cumulative catheter survival was 93.5%, 82.5%, 63.9%, and 60.0% at 1, 2, 3, and 4 years respectively. The mean observation period was 19. 7 +\/- 17.8 months, and the longest catheter survival was 87.5 months. New episodes of peritonitis were 91 in number, a rate of 1 episode per 28 patient-months. Although catheter survival exceeded the recommendation of better than 80% at 1 year, we noted a trend toward lower catheter survival and a higher peritonitis rate than were reported earlier in this series with a smaller number of catheters. That trend is partly explained by repeated episodes of peritonitis in 11 catheters; 8.5% of the patients experienced 40% of the peritonitis episodes.","261":"Heart failure is a major and growing health problem. Major advances leading to newer therapies are being made in understanding the pathophysiology of heart failure as a chronic progressive disorder. Whatever the cause, all heart failure patients eventually progress to a refractory stage characterized by worsening renal function and resistance to diuretic therapy with attending severe edema. A logical treatment for this \"cardiorenal syndrome\" is the use of dialysis, which is efficient in treating both the hypervolemia and azotemia of refractory heart failure. Although all modalities of dialysis have been tried, peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the simplest choice and offers several advantages. It is an already-established long-term home-based therapy and does not require complex machinery or hospital resources. It is associated with preservation of residual renal function, gentle continuous ultrafiltration, hemodynamic stability, better middle-molecule clearance, sodium sieving with maintenance of normonatremia and perhaps less inflammation than hemodialysis is, especially with newer PD solutions. In the present paper, we discuss the potential advantages of PD in the treatment of heart failure, review the available literature, and lay some foundations for future research.","262":"In the present study, we evaluated bone mineral density (BMD) in relation to the age and sex of dialysis patients. The study was performed in 30 patients divided into two groups according to age (older group: 12 patients older than 65 years; younger group: 18 patients 65 years of age or younger) and according to sex (18 women, 12 men). We used dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry to examine BMD in the femoral neck (N) and lumbar spine (L2-L4). We simultaneously evaluated parathyroid hormone, calcium-phosphate balance, blood pH, markers of inflammation and nutrition status, and measurements of body composition by bioimpedance analysis. We found significant differences for BMD measured in N (older group: 0. 709 +\/- 0.111 g\/cm2; younger group: 0.884 +\/- 0.130 g\/cm2), T-score [older group: -2.64 (range: -4.06 to -0.17); younger group: -0.88 (range: -3.25 to 2.37)], and BMD as a percentage of peak bone density [older group: 68.0% (54.2%-97.0%); younger group: 89.5% (range; 61.4%-135.0%)]. The older patients also had lower serum albumin and higher serum ferritin. After adjustment of the results by sex, the older group also showed lower serum Ca and lean body mass and higher serum glucose. Grouping of the patients by sex revealed significant differences in BMD when results were adjusted for age: men had a higher BMD in N (0.85 +\/- 0.16 g\/cm2) than women did (0. 79 +\/- 0.14 g\/cm2). We conclude that older age, which is more frequently associated with protein malnutrition, inflammation, and glucose abnormalities than is younger age, is also the important factor influencing BMD loss in dialysis patients.","263":"Heart failure is a major public health problem and a leading cause of hospitalization in adults in the United States. Renal dysfunction is emerging as a critical feature of patients hospitalized with heart failure and as a strong predictor of increased mortality. Despite the challenges and unique problems of patients with heart failure who have end-stage renal disease, evidence-based data regarding optimal management of these patients are limited. Here, we explore recent advances in the understanding of cardiorenal interactions and future directions in management strategies for patients with congestive heart failure on dialysis.","264":"Studies using animal models of peritoneal dialysis (PD) have commonly induced acute peritonitis by intraperitoneal (IP) administration of lipopolysaccharide (LPS). We compared the effects of peritonitis induced by IP administration of either LPS or zymosan on inflammatory parameters [dialysate leukocyte counts and dialysate concentrations of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)] and peritoneal transport of fluid, small solutes (glucose), and macromolecules (total protein) in a mouse model of PD. Eighteen hours after induction of peritonitis, mice were studied by injecting 2 mL of 4.25% dextrose-containing PD solution into the peritoneal cavity for a 2-hour dwell. Concentrations of glucose, total protein, PGE2, and VEGF were determined in the dialysate effluent. Acute peritonitis induced by IP administration of LPS induced changes in peritoneal transport similar to those observed during clinical PD, but without a significant increase in the dialysate leukocyte count. In contrast, acute peritonitis induced by IP administration of zymosan induced a large increase in dialysate leukocyte count, more substantial changes in peritoneal transport, and increases in dialysate PGE2 and VEGF concentrations. We conclude that acute peritonitis induced by IP administration of zymosan in the mouse may be a more relevant model for clinical PD, because it produces substantial changes in peritoneal transport and leukocyte migration into the peritoneal cavity.","265":"Cardiovascular complications are obviously important in the management of dialysis patients, and ultrasonography can be used to evaluate cardiac indices that can predict these complications. However, long-term longitudinal changes in ultrasonographic cardiovascular indices in dialysis patients are not well known. Also, the implications of lipid metabolism for cardiovascular change in dialysis patients is controversial. We therefore analyzed ultrasonographic cardiac parameters and laboratory data for lipid metabolism in patients who had been on peritoneal dialysis (PD) or hemodialysis (HD) for 8 years and also in patients who had been on PD for 4 years followed by another 4 years on HD. We found that lipid metabolism was worse but that cardiovascular indices were more stable over time in PD patients than in HD patients. Mean blood pressure was also better maintained in PD patients. These results indicate that cardiovascular function can be maintained in PD patients over the long term, given that blood pressure is controlled even though dyslipidemia worsens.","266":"Better control of cardiovascular function in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) is critical because PD patients have a tendency to overhydration, which has been proved to be associated with cardiovascular and patient outcome. In the general population, lipid metabolism is also considered to be an important indicator of future cardiovascular events. Icodextrin has been used to improve ultrafiltration volume without increasing dextrose load. We therefore expected that parameters of lipid metabolism and cardiovascular function could both be improved, or at least maintained, after icodextrin use in PD patients. We therefore analyzed those parameters in 14 prevalent PD patients who required a switch from dextrose to icodextrin solution for the long dwell at 1 year before the switch, at the time of the switch, and at 1 and 2 years after the switch. In the study patients, cardiovascular remodeling evaluated by ultrasonographic left ventricular mass index was diminished, but the intima media area of the cervical artery was elevated after icodextrin use. Intima media thickness did not change over time. Biochemical indices such as brain natriuretic peptide, atrial natriuretic peptide, lipoprotein A, total cholesterol, and triglycerides were all lower after icodextrin use. These results indicate that icodextrin has the potential to improve lipid metabolism, volemic status, and cardiac hypertrophy in prevalent PD patients. However, atherosclerotic vascular change is refractory to improvement.","267":"The plasticizer di(2-ethylhexyl)phthalate (DEHP) used in peritoneal dialysate bags is known to dissolve into the solution, even though the quantity is small. Long-term exposure of the peritoneum to DEHP could be a cause of peritoneal deterioration. Although some papers have been published about DEHP toxicity to the peritoneum, acute DEHP toxicity is not fully understood to date. We therefore conducted the present in vitro study, using peritoneal mesothelial cells to examine acute DEHP toxicity. Peritoneal mesothelial cells were harvested from the peritonea of Sprague-Dawley rats and were cultured in Dulbecco modified eagle medium supplemented with 1% fetal calf serum. Confluent mesothelial cells were incubated with DEHP at various concentrations for 24 hours. The concentration of lactate dehydrogenase in the supernatant was measured and compared to control samples. In addition, apoptosis of mesothelial cells was examined by the TUNEL method at various concentrations of DEHP. We found that DEHP (260pmol\/L to 2.6 mmol\/L) neither elevated lactate dehydrogenate in the supernatant nor induced apoptosis of cultured mesothelial cells. The concentration of DEHP in peritoneal dialysate bags is reported to be approximately 20 nmol\/L. Our results indicate that the plasticizer dissolved in dialysis solution from peritoneal dialysate bags does not have significant acute toxicity on peritoneal mesothelial cells. Furthermore, apoptosis may not be induced even after long-term and repeated use of solution from peritoneal dialysate bags.","268":"During long-term exposure to continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (PD), the characteristics of the peritoneal membrane may be altered. The substrate for nitric oxide synthesis is L-arginine, which may enter cells via the y+ and y+L transport systems. Peritoneal membrane characteristics may depend on vascular function and the L-arginine-NO pathway. Maximal capacity for L-arginine transport is higher in patients with a lower dialysis adequacy index. Our aim was to evaluate erythrocyte L-arginine uptake in PD patients at the start and end of a 3-year interval. Our longitudinal study evaluated 8 stable patients on PD who were not using NO donors and who had been free of peritonitis for at least 1 month. Uptake of L-arginine was measured in 2003 and again in 2006. Maximal transport capacity (Vmax, in micromoles per liter-cells per hour) and half-saturation constant (km, in micromoles per liter) were measured in erythrocytes using 14C as a marker and N-ethylmaleimide as inhibitor of the y+ system. For the years 2003 and 2006 respectively, mean +\/- standard deviation for total L-arginine uptake Vmax was 749 +\/- 182 micromol\/L-cells\/h and 1146 +\/- 365 micromol\/L-cells\/h (p = 0.016, paired t-test),for y+L Vmax was 180 +\/- 58 micromol\/L-cells\/h and 515 +\/- 142 micromol\/L-cells\/h (p = 0. 002), and for y+ Vmax was 556 +\/- 177 micromol\/L-cells\/h and 662 +\/- 267 micromol\/ L-cells\/h (nonsignificant). The total y+L and y+km were not significantly different. The L-arginine maximal uptake capacity in erythrocytes increased after 3 years of PD treatment. These findings agree with the suggestion of an association between y+L activity and dialysis adequacy or uremia toxicity. Peritoneal membrane characteristics may depend on vascular function and the L-arginine-NO pathway.","269":"The permeability for small solutes and the ultrafiltration capacity of the peritoneum are essential for effective peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment. Elucidation of the factors that regulate these two properties is therefore of great importance. Ouabain, a potent inhibitor of the Na+-K+ pump has been shown to reduce fluid absorption in animal models of PD. In the present study, we used Ussing chamber experiments to investigate the effect of ouabain on the transmesothelial electrical resistance (RTM) of isolated visceral sheep peritoneum. Peritoneal samples from the omentum of adult sheep were isolated immediately after the deaths of the animals and were transferred to the laboratory in cooled Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (4 degrees C, pH 7.5) bubbled with 95% O2\/5% CO2. A planar sheet of visceral peritoneum was mounted in an Ussing-type chamber, and ouabain (10(-3) mol\/L) was added apically and basolaterally. The RTM was measured before and serially for 30 minutes after the addition of ouabain. Because active ion transport is temperature-dependent, all measurements were taken at 37 degrees C. The results presented are the mean +\/- standard error of 6 experiments. Before the addition of ouabain, the control RTM was measured as 21.26 +\/- 0.57 Omega x cm2. Addition of ouabain basolaterally induced an increase in the RTM to 27.62 +\/- 0.72 Omega x cm2 within 1 minute (p &lt; 0.05), and this level persisted throughout the experiment. The effect of ouabain, when added apically, was similar, characterized by a rapid rise in the RTM to 24.66 +\/- 0. 76 Omega x cm2 at 1 minute (p &lt; 0. 05), with subsequent persistence at that level. A clear association between RTM and active ion transport has been shown in previous studies. The results of the present study, showing a rapid effect of ouabain on the RTM of visceral peritoneum, therefore clearly suggest that cell membrane Na+K+-ATPase is important for peritoneal ionic transport. In addition, ouabain was previously shown to reduce vasodilation and intraperitoneal sodium or to increase intraperitoneal volume, especially in the presence of conventional acidic solutions. Those findings, combined with the results of the present study, clearly indicate that intraperitoneal administration of digitalis glycosides may have some beneficial effect in PD patients; however the specific clinical implications need further investigation.","270":"The mesothelium is part of the peritoneal barrier that manages the water and ion transport essential for peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment. In addition, it has a central role in the pathogenesis of peritoneal fibrosis and the resulting ultrafiltration failure observed in many PD patients. Endothelin-1 (ET-1) is a potent vasoactive peptide originally described as an endothelial cell-derived factor In addition, ET-1 has been shown to stimulate fibrogenic activity in various organs by regulating the production and turnover of matrix components. The aim of the present study was to investigate, by means of Ussing chamber experiments, the effect of ET-1 on the transmesothelial electrical resistance (RTM) of isolated visceral sheep peritoneum. Intact sheets of visceral sheep peritoneum were obtained from 12 adult sheep. The samples were collected from the slaughterhouse immediately after the deaths of the animals and, within 30 minutes, were transferred in oxygenated Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate (KRB) solution at 4 degrees C to the laboratory to be mounted in an Ussing-type chamber. Endothelin-1 (10(-7) mol\/L) was then added to the KRB solution apically or basolaterally, and the RTM was measured before and serially for 10 minutes after the addition of the ET-1. The control RTM (before addition of ET-1) was 22.8 +\/- 0.56 Omega x cm2. Addition of ET-1 apically significantly increased the RTM by 63.82% +\/- 16.93% (p &lt; 0.05) within 1 minute. After addition of ET-1 basolaterally, the RTM also increased significantly by 90.91% +\/- 57.31% within 1 minute (p &lt; 0.05). In both cases, these values persisted throughout the experiment. These results clearly indicate an inhibitory effect of ET-1 on the ionic permeability of visceral sheep peritoneum. The rapid increase in RTM observed after the addition of ET-1 suggests the existence of endothelin receptors (ET-A or ET-B, or both) on visceral sheep peritoneum. Previous studies demonstrated that ET-1, acting on ET-B receptors, potently inhibits epithelial sodium channels in mammalian cell cultures. Nevertheless, the exact pathways that underlie these findings remain unclear; their elucidation requires further investigation.","271":"The peritoneal mesothelium is one of the main barriers to ion transport in peritoneal dialysis. In a previous study, we showed the existence of a micro-opioid influence on the in vitro ionic permeability of serosal membranes (specifically, pleura and pericardium), which become less permeable to ionic currents after the action of morphine. In the present study, we used Ussing chamber experiments to investigate the effect of morphine on the transmesothelial electrical resistance (RTM) of isolated parietal sheep peritoneum. Peritoneal samples from the diaphragm of adult sheep were isolated directly after the death of the animals and were transferred to the laboratory within 30 minutes in a cooled Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (4 degrees C, pH 7.5) bubbled with 95% O2\/5% CO2. A planar sheet of parietal peritoneum was mounted in an Ussing-type chamber and morphine (10(-9) mol\/L) was added apically and basolaterally. The RTM was measured before and serially for 30 minutes after the addition of morphine. Because active ion transport is temperature dependent, the Ussing chamber was held at 37 degrees C. Results presented are the mean +\/- standard error of 6 experiments. The control RTM (before the addition of morphine) was 20.26 +\/- 0.57 Omega x cm2. Addition of morphine basolaterally induced, within 1 minute, an increase in RTM of 24% +\/- 4.8%, which declined thereafter (p &lt; 0.01). When morphine was added apically, the results were not similar, because no significant change occurred in the RTM. The RTM is an established surrogate of peritoneal permeability. The results of the present study indicate rapid action of basolaterally added morphine on the permeability of the parietal peritoneum. The observed increase in the RTM indicates the existence in the parietal peritoneum of micro-opioid receptors that seem to prevail basolaterally. The clinical implications of these results should be further investigated.","272":"Loss of peritoneal function is a major factor leading to failure of treatment in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Although the precise biologic mechanisms responsible for these changes have not been defined, the general assumption is that alterations in peritoneal function are related to structural changes in the peritoneal membrane. The aim of the present study was to uncover the relationship between functional parameters of peritoneum and peritoneal thickness as measured by ultrasonography. We studied 43 prevalent patients who had been on PD for at least 12 months in the Ege University PD unit. We recorded body weight, height, age, sex, PD duration, episodes of peritonitis, and results of peritoneal equilibration tests. Parietal peritoneal thickness was measured from four abdominal quadrants at the mid-clavicular line. The peritoneal thickness measurement was determined as the mean of the four separate measurements. (In some cases, the measurement at one of the lower quadrants was excluded from the calculation if the peritoneal catheter was present near the area probed.) Mean peritoneal thickness in the patients was 446 +\/- 164 microm (range: 250-930 microm), which was significantly correlated with mean body weight (r = 0.31, p &lt; 0.05), height (r = 0.31, p &lt; 0.05), end-to-initial ratio of dialysate glucose (r = -0.44, p &lt; 0. 01), dialysate-to-plasma creatinine (r = 0.51, p &lt; 0.01), and PD duration (r = 0.48, p &lt; 0.01). Peritoneal thickness was positively correlated with time on dialysis, being a median of 370 microm [interquartile range (IQR): 283-400 microm] in patients who had been on PD for less than 24 months up and 660 microm (IQR: 483-733 microm) in patients who had undergone PD for more than 6 years. Ultrasound examination is a simple and noninvasive method of measuring peritoneal thickness in PD patients. It may be useful in the study of peritoneal structure and function. Sequential measurements over time may be useful for early diagnosis of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis.","273":"The present article provides a theoretical description of the changes of interstitial hydrostatic pressure, tissue hydration, and protein distribution in the tissue during a peritoneal dwell with isotonic fluid. The mathematical model is based on the concept of uniformly distributed capillary and lymphatic systems within a deformable, porous tissue. Protein transport was analyzed for diffusive and convective transport of serum albumin (SA) and radiolabeled albumin (RISA; added to dialysis fluid) using Darcy's law for fluid flux through the tissue and the two-pore theory for water and protein flow across blood capillary walls. Numerical results showed a local increase of interstitial hydrostatic pressure and tissue hydration over physiologic level in the tissue layer close to the peritoneal surface. The water inflow to the tissue displaced interstitial SA into the deeper tissue layers and yielded RISA accumulation in the tissue at a concentration locally higher than that in the dialysis fluid. The description of water flow agreed with clinical data, but yielded a higher-than-expected hydrostatic pressure in the deep tissue layers. The steady-state rates of fluid and RISA absorption from the peritoneal cavity, but not of SA clearance, agreed with the clinical data.","274":"We undertook in vitro experiments to examine the importance of mesothelium and interstitium in icodextrin (7.5 g\/dL) transport and the change in that transport caused by gentamicin and methylglyoxal. Rabbit peritoneum, a modified Ussing chamber and a mathematical model of mass transport were used. Transfer from the interstitial to mesothelial side of the membrane (I--&gt;M) and in the opposite direction (M--&gt;I), expressed as a diffusive permeability coefficient P, was determined in control series, after chemical modification of the peritoneum by sodium deoxycholate, and after introduction of gentamicin and methylglyoxal. We also investigated the thickness of native tissue 75 minutes into the study and after use of sodium deoxycholate. In the control series, icodextrin I--&gt;M transport increased by 50%, but M--&gt;I transport remained stable [15-60 min vs. 75-120 min. I--&gt;M P, 0.32 +\/- 0.04 x 10(-4) cm x s(-1) (standard error of the mean); M--&gt;I P, 0.19 +\/- 0.03 x 10(-4) cm x s(-1)]. After application of sodium deoxycholate, I--&gt;M transport was observed to increase by 21% and M--&gt;I by 192% as compared with the 2nd hour of the control series. Gentamicin caused a rise of M--&gt;I transport by 21% without a change of I--&gt;M. We observed no difference in p values (I--&gt;M and M--&gt;I) after application of methylglyoxal. Mean thickness before and 75 minutes into the study was 4.96 +\/- 0.28 microm for mesothelium and 62.09 +\/- 2.40 microm for the whole peritoneum. Sodium deoxycholate reduced the mesothelium thickness by 20% and increased the peritoneum thickness by 37%. The present study confirms that, in vitro, icodextrin I--&gt;M peritoneal transport changes with time, but M--&gt;I is constant. Asymmetry of glucose polymer diffusion is observed. I--&gt;M predominates over M--&gt;I. Chemical modification of the peritoneum by sodium deoxycholate (I--&gt;M and M--&gt;I directions) and by gentamicin (M--&gt;I direction only), but not by methylglyoxal, intensifies icodextrin transport. Sodium deoxycholate causes exfoliation of the mesothelium and looseness of the interstitium.","275":"Of the two main renal replacement therapies, peritoneal dialysis (PD) was the modality first used for the treatment of patients with acute renal failure (ARF) because of its inherent advantages. Highly trained personnel, expensive and complex apparatus, and systemic anticoagulation were not needed, and so the procedure could be simply and quickly initiated. Further, because of the gradual removal of fluid and solutes, PD results in better hemodynamic stability. Manually or cycler-assisted (\"automated\") PD has been successfully used in many ARF patients, especially those at risk of bleeding or with hemodynamic instability, and in infants and children with ARF or circulatory failure. Recently, technological developments in hemodialysis techniques (bicarbonate dialysis, hemofiltration, hemodiafiltration) and the continuous renal replacement therapies (CRRTs), have limited the indications for PD in critically ill patients with ARF. In addition, better knowledge about the connection between early and adequate dialysis dose and improved outcomes has led to a tendency to increase the dialysis dose given to ARF patients, furthering the development of newer techniques. Although PD has been considered less effective than hemodialysis and CRRTs are in patients with severe acute illness (pulmonary edema, poisoning, extreme catabolysis) and ARF, PD remains an effective therapy that is easily and simply instituted, especially for infants and children with ARF, both within and outside of intensive care settings.","276":"We investigated a distributed model for the transport of fluid and glucose that allows for the description of hydrostatic pressure, interstitial fluid void volume, and glucose profiles in the tissue. Computer simulations for conditions mimicking the initial minutes of a peritoneal dialysis dwell with 3.86% glucose demonstrated that the rate of fluid flow to the peritoneal cavity was sensitive mostly to the reflection coefficient for glucose in the capillary wall, sigmaCG, whereas the hydrostatic pressure in deep tissue layers was sensitive to the reflection coefficient for glucose in the interstitium, sigmaTG. For hydrostatic pressure in the peritoneal cavity equal to 12 mmHg, sigmaCG = 0.5, sigmaTG = 0.005, and other parameters taken from published physiologic data, the rate of ultrafiltration was about 9 mL\/min. Glucose concentration and hydrostatic pressure in the tissue increased in a layer less than 2 mm from the peritoneal cavity; deeper layers were close to their equilibrium values. If a high-value osmotic coefficient for the capillary wall is assumed, the proposed model describes hydrostatic pressure and glucose profiles that agree with available data.","277":"","278":"To determine the frequency of low carnitine levels, we measured serum carnitine in pediatric patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD). Our prospective cross-sectional study was conducted from September 2004 to March 2005 in a single pediatric center, and included patients under 17 years of age who had been on HD or PD for more than 3 months. Patients with primary carnitine deficiency were excluded. A 4-day food diary was used for carnitine intake quantification. Serum total and free carnitine and acylcarnitine were measured. We compared patients with low and normal carnitine levels using the chi-square test, Mann-Whitney U-test, and Spearman correlation. Of 100 study patients, 70 were on PD, and 61 were male. The median age was 13 years, and the median time on dialysis, 10.5 months. Median serum free carnitine was 32.75 nmol\/mL. Carnitine levels were lower than normal in 75 patients and reached the level of deficiency in 29. No difference was found between the dialysis modality types for any fraction of carnitine. No correlation was found between the level of free carnitine and time on dialysis (r = -0.009, p = 0.9) or carnitine intake (r = -0.84, p = 0.4). In conclusion, the frequency ofl ow serum carnitine among pediatric patient on dialysis is high.","279":"We evaluated serum markers of bone turnover (BT) in patients suspected to have low bone turnover (LBT) given their serum level of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). Studies were carried out in 30 dialyzed patients. In 9 patients, iPTH was below 100 pg\/mL (LBT group), and in 21, it was above 100 pg\/mL (non-LBT group). Other measured laboratory parameters included serum concentrations of cyclase inactivating parathyroid hormone (CAP), osteoprotegerin (OPG), OPG ligand (OPGL), inorganic phosphates, total calcium, creatinine, urea, serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity, and blood pH. The LBT group showed significantly lower levels of iPTH (39.0 +\/- 30.7 pg\/mL), CAP (23.2 +\/- 16.9 pg\/mL), cyclase inactive parathyroid hormone (CIP: 15.8 +\/- 15.0 pg\/mL), and total ALP (83.9 +\/- 26.2 IU\/L) than did the non-LBT group (393 +\/- 304 pg\/mL, 268 +\/- 216 pg\/mL, 126 +\/- 96 pg\/mL, and 202 +\/- 167 IU\/L respectively). We observed no significant differences between the groups in the other examined parameters. When results were adjusted for sex, age, and dialysis modality and duration, differences remained significant only for iPTH and CIP. Our data indicate that a serum CIP concentration below 25 pg\/mL has a significance similar to that of an iPTH concentration below 100 pg\/mL in determining which dialyzed patients likely have LBT.","280":"Renal osteodystrophy encompasses several histologic subtypes, all of which can undergo change over time. In peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, we studied bone histology and the factors influencing any changes over 1 year In 44 PD patients, we collected two paired bone biopsies (at baseline and after 12 months) and biochemical and treatment data (at baseline and every 3 months). Of the 44 original patients, 24 completed the study. Of these 24 patients, 19 were initially diagnosed with adynamic bone lesion (ABL). After 1 year, 12 still had ABL; the other 7 had changed to high turnover bone lesion (HTBL). Another 5 patients were initially diagnosed with HTBL. Among these, 4 still had HTBL at 1 year; 1 had changed to ABL. In patients who changed to HTBL from ABL, serum albumin had increased to 4.2 +\/- 0.3 g\/dL at month 12 from 3.7 +\/- 0.4 g\/dL at baseline (p &lt; 0.05). In patients who still had ABL, serum albumin did not change. Additionally, the percentage increase in serum albumin over the study was higher in HTBL patients than in ABL patients (0.1408 +\/- 0.139 g\/dL vs. -0.0076 +\/- 0.113 g\/dL, p = 0.009). A lower likelihood of diabetes (p = 0.033) and a higher serum albumin [area under the curve: 0.822; 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.651 to 0.993] identified a HTBL diagnosis at 12 months. Older age increased the probability of changing to ABL (OR: 1.2935; 95% CI: 1.03 to 1.67; p= 0.02). Bone lesions can change over time, and this change is associated with age, diabetes, and serum albumin. A change to HTBL was associated with improvement in serum albumin. Protein status is possibly a factor influencing bone lesion outcome.","281":"The major cause of death in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) is vascular complications, including congestive heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, and myocardial infarction. To clarify the risk factors for vascular complications in patients on PD, we investigated the clinical course of PD in patients with and without cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications. From among 327 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients initiated onto PD from April 1995 to March 2005 in the Kidney and Dialysis Center, Saitama Medical School, 8 developed de novo cardiovascular and cerebrovascular complications (CVD group--mean age: 58.3 +\/- 4.9 years; 5 men, 3 women). We compared data pertaining to body weight, blood pressure, blood chemistry, and cardiothoracic ratio (CTR) between the CVD group and an age- and sex-matched control group (n = 8; mean age: 57.5 +\/- 4.0 years). At baseline, we observed no significant differences of body weight, blood pressure, CTR, hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, HbA1c, or serum albumin between the CVD group and the control group. In the CVD group, 1 month before the onset of CVD, serum albumin was significantly lower than in the control group (2.9 +\/- 0.2 g\/dL vs. 3.8 +\/- 0.1 g\/dL, p = 0.0029). Body weight in the CVD group was significantly lower than in the control group (56.8 +\/- 2.8 kg vs. 63.0 +\/- 2.9 kg, p = 0.0086). No significant differences were observed in blood pressure, CTR, hemoglobin, total cholesterol, triglycerides, or HbA1c between the groups. A decrease in serum albumin after commencement of dialysis is an important risk factor for, and a strong predictor of vascular complications in patients on PD. To help prevent vascular complications, it is important to monitor and manage serum albumin in patients on PD.","282":"Metabolic acidosis correction is one of the goals of renal replacement therapy. Correction of acidosis in peritoneal dialysis (PD) may be affected by PD modalities such as automated PD (APD) or by new solutions containing a combination of bicarbonate and lactate as a buffer [bicarbonate continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD)]. The aim of the present study was to examine the acid-base status of our PD population and to compare the effects of APD, lactate CAPD, and bicarbonate CAPD on serum bicarbonate levels. We studied 35 stable patients undergoing APD (n = 15), lactate-buffered (35 mEq\/L) CAPD (n = 14), and bicarbonate\/lactate-buffered CAPD (n = 6) for 48.5 +\/- 38.1 months. Most of our patients had serum bicarbonate levels in the normal range. In 3 patients (8%), HCO3 was below 22 mEq\/L, and in 8 patients (22%; APD = 2, lactate CAPD = 2, bicarbonate CAPD = 4), HCO3 was above 28 mEq\/L. We found no statistically significant correlations between HCO3 serum levels and PD prescription, peritoneal membrane characteristics, or intake of calcium carbonate and sevelamer hydrochloride. Patients on bicarbonate CAPD had higher HCO3 serum levels, but this difference disappeared when corrections for duration of dialysis, residual urine volume, and PD adequacy indices were applied. In the studied PD population, adequate correction of metabolic acidosis was achieved, as reflected in serum bicarbonate levels. We observed no difference in serum bicarbonate levels between APD and lactate CAPD patients. The new bicarbonate-buffered PD solutions are more biocompatible and can result in higher serum bicarbonate levels. However, a significant number of PD patients on bicarbonate-buffered solutions may become alkalotic. The clinical significance of these results needs further examination in prospective studies.","283":"Selection of the initial dialysis modality is crucial in the treatment of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Several patient- and physician-related factors play important roles in the decision between peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD). Although HD is the most common dialysis modality in the United States, in some studies PD has shown a survival advantage over HD, at least in the first 2 years of dialysis treatment, especially in non-diabetic patients and in young patients with diabetes. Other advantages accrue to early PD use in many patients. An integrated care approach with \"healthy start\" and PD as the initial renal replacement therapy, followed by timely transfer to HD once complications arise, may improve the long-term survival of ESRD patients.","284":"The number of patients initiating dialysis in most countries continues to increase, with the greatest increase being in the oldest age group. Clinical practice guidelines have been developed to help the nephrology team with end-of-life carefor patients on dialysis. The aim of the project reported here was to assess if we were meeting the guidelines. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of all patients 80 years of age and older who had started dialysis at our center Our cohort included 105 patients (50% men; median age: 84.5 years; age range: 80-95 years), of whom 55% were on hemodialysis and 45% were on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Overall life expectancy was 2.1 years. Among the 59 patients who died while still part of our program, 92% had a do not resuscitate order in place, and 46% had withdrawn from dialysis. Palliative care was consulted in 46% of cases. Dyspnea and pain were the two most common symptoms in the last 24 hours of life. Of these 59 patients, 71% died in hospital. Only 6 patients died at home, all of these being on home PD. End-of-life care for this elderly cohort of dialysis patients could be improved on several measures to meet clinical practice guidelines, especially with greater access to palliative care units and community palliative care programs.","285":"The pathogenesis of calciphylaxis, which has a rising incidence in the chronic dialysis population and a high mortality rate, is poorly understood. Abnormalities in the calcium-phosphorus-parathyroid axis are clinically related to calciphylaxis, but alone, they cannot explain this condition. Here, we present two patients who had chronic inflammatory conditions and hyperparathyroidism and who developed calciphylaxis. A 41-year-old white woman on hemodialysis following scleroderma, hepatitis C, liver transplant, and failed kidney transplant, developed progressive ulcerative lower extremity calciphylaxis lasting more than 3 years. She had evidence of severe hyperparathyroidism and elevated serum C-reactive protein (CRP). A 39-year-old white woman on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for 6 years for renal failure secondary to lupus nephritis, with sustained lupus activity during the dialysis period, developed rapidly progressing ulcerative calciphylaxis of the lower and upper extremities not responding to adequate treatment of hyperphosphatemia and hyperparathyroidism. Her condition culminated in death within 2 months of the appearance of the skin lesions. Her serum CRP was elevated on a sustained basis before the development of the calciphylaxis and rose to a very high level after appearance of the skin lesions. Inflammation may assist in the development of calciphylaxis through depression of serum levels of fetuin-A, an endogenous inhibitor of calcification that is also a negative acute-phase reactant. The interactions between inflammation-mediated changes in the levels of endogenous inhibitors of calcification and abnormalities in calcium-phosphorus metabolism merit intensive study in the future as potential mechanisms of calciphylaxis.","286":"New peritoneal dialysis solutions with neutral pH and lactate bicarbonate, or combinations of both buffer bases, have been clinically tested in various countries. The experience is most encouraging and consistent with the laboratory data generated in animals and tissue cultures. The available studies suggest improvement in cellular function and viability and better biocompatibility. However the reported studies do not define the specific contributions of neutral pH per se versus those of bicarbonate or reduction in glucose degradation products. Studies designed to address this important question are required.","287":"Although medication non adherence is common in all populations, including those on chronic dialysis, the reasons for medication noncompliance in dialysis patients have rarely been examined. We surveyed 54 chronic dialysis patients (15 on peritoneal dialysis, 39 on hemodialysis), asking about their social and financial situations, medication coverage, and reasons for possibly not obtaining all prescribed medications. The study population was 56% female, 52% African American, 67% over 50 years of age, 27% diabetic, and 61% on dialysis for more than 2 years. One patient was unemployed, 33 were retired, 15 were on disability, and 5 were employed. A majority (63%) had a household income of dollars 25,000 or more annually. Most (70%) had some medication coverage through one or more health plans (53% Medicare, 14% Medicaid, 31% private) or a local pharmacy (31% UVA pharmacy program for the medically indigent). However, 39% still spent more than dollars 100 monthly on medications. Co-pays per prescription ranged from nothing (2 patients) to dollars 25 or more (16 patients), with half having a co-pay of more than dollars 11 per prescription. Most (69%) took 11 or more medications daily. Among all our study patients, 91% reported that they knew their medications and the reasons that those medications were prescribed. The choice not to fill a prescription was made by 30% of patients either because they had no money (67%) or no ride to the pharmacy (17%). When asked if they ever chose not to take specific medications, 11 of 53 respondents (21%) said yes because of side effects [4 (36%)] or cost [3 (27%)], or because they already take too many medications [2 (18%)]. Most respondents (91%) reported discussing their medications with their doctors, and a majority (65%) had these discussions at least monthly. We conclude that inadequate prescription coverage, lack of transportation, and medication cost are primary contributors to medication noncompliance among chronic dialysis patients. Patients report knowing their medications and the reasons that those medications are prescribed, and having ample opportunities to discuss their medications with their physicians. Lack of patient education therefore does not seem to be an important factor in medication non adherence.","288":"Hydrothorax is an uncommon but well-recognized complication of peritoneal dialysis. Here, we describe a case of hydrothorax in a peritoneal dialysis patient who underwent video-assisted thorascopic surgery and talc pleurodesis for a diaphragmatic defect to preserve peritoneal dialysis capabilities. We reviewed the literature for 2001-2005 to assess how others have handled this situation and whether patients have returned successfully to peritoneal dialysis.","289":"Feeding through a gastrostomy button (GB) provides benefits to the families of children on chronic dialysis. But data on the transition to oral feeding following renal transplantation--especially in children under 2--is scarce. Here, we report our experience of more than 14 years in 22 children who were GB fed at under 5 years of age (median age: 1.66 years; range: 0.25-4.25 years). We excluded 6 children from the analysis of transition following transplantation because of factors precluding early return to oral feeding--specifically, cognitive impairment and a tongue tie. We compared 10 children who commenced GB feeding at less than 2 years (group 1) with those who commenced at 2-5 years (group 2, n = 6). All 16 children made the transition to normal oral feeding by 10 months post transplantation. Median duration of GB feeding post-transplant in group 1 was 0.3 years (range: 0.1-1.0 years) as compared with 0.2 years (range: 0-0.3 years) in group 2 (p = 0.2). Children with normal cognition and no other precluding factors who have a GB inserted at less than 2 years of age can make a successful transition from GB to oral feeding with no significant delay. Family support should be individualized during this period of potential anxiety.","290":"The Tenckhoff catheter was developed in 1968 and has been widely used since for chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Variations of the Tenckhoff catheter have been designed over the years in a search for the ideal PD catheter--an access that can provide reliable dialysate flow rates with few complications. Currently, data derived from randomized, controlled, multicenter trials dedicated to testing how catheter design and placement technique influence long-term catheter survival and function are scarce. As a result, no firm guidelines exist at the national or international levels on optimal PD catheter type or implantation technique. Also, no current statistics on the use of PD catheters are available. The last survey was carried out using an audience response system at the Annual Peritoneal Dialysis Conference in Orlando, Florida, in January 1994. The present analysis is based on a new survey done at the 2005 Annual Dialysis Conference in Tampa, Florida. It is a snapshot of preferences in catheter design and implantation technique in 2004 from an international sample of 65 respondent chronic PD centers. The Tenckhoff catheter remains the most widely used catheter, followed closely by the swan-neck catheter in both adult and pediatric respondent centers. Double-cuff catheters continue to be preferred over single-cuff catheters, and coiled intraperitoneal segments are generally preferred over straight intra-peritoneal segments. Surgical implantation technique remains the prevailing placement method in both pediatric and adult respondent centers.","291":"Although the use of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) to treat refractory heart failure is not new, in combination with current medical treatment it improves patients'symptoms as well as their cardiac function. We started 16 patients (13 men with a mean age of 66.3 +\/- 2.8 years, and 3 women with a mean age of 72 +\/- 4.2 years) on CAPD. All patients were symptomatic with congestive heart failure. Mean left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) before the start of CAPD was 31% +\/- 3%. Introduction to CAPD was associated with a significant improvement in LVEF (to 44% +\/- 6%, p &lt; 0.05) and in blood pressure control at 1 year. Also at 1 year, 87% of patients were classified as New York Heart Association grade I or II (maximum possible grade is grade III). These results suggest that CAPD is a treatment of choice for patients suffering from a combination of congestive heart failure and chronic renal insufficiency.","292":"Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD) both have advantages in the treatment of patients with renal failure. In CAPD, solute removal is sometimes insufficient in patients who have a relatively large muscle mass that produces high levels of creatinine. To compensate for this deficiency, frequent exchanges and large dialysate volumes are required. We previously reported that once-weekly HD helps CAPD patients who experience insufficient solute removal. In the present study, we followed, for more than 3 years, 9 CAPD patients who underwent additional weekly HD. Add-on HD therapy significantly increased the subjects' weekly peritoneal creatinine clearance to 45 +\/- 3 L (mean +\/- standard deviation); these values rose to more than 60 L over the course of the study. Our findings suggest that the combined use of CAPD and HD improves solute clearance in CAPD patients who are insufficiently dialyzed.","293":"Carnitine has an essential role in the mitochondrial oxidation of long-chain fatty acids. Carnitine deficiency has been described in patients with chronic kidney disease. Total carnitine (TC) deficiency or a lower-than-normal ratio of free carnitine to acylated carnitine (FC:AC) has been shown to be associated with disorders in metabolism and plasma lipids. Metabolism and therapeutic use of carnitine have therefore been a major area of interest in dialysis patients. In a prospective observational study, we determined carnitine status (TC and FC:AC) and its correlations with lipid plasma levels in peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients. In pediatric patients on chronic PD or HD, we evaluated nutritional status (weight and height), biochemical parameters (TC, FC, and AC levels), and fasting plasma lipoprotein concentrations. We studied 35 patients (16 boys, 19 girls; 25 on PD, 10 on HD). Median age was 5 years (range: 3 months-15 years). Median weight-to-height Z-score was -0.5 (range: -2.1 to 1.9), and median height-to-age Z-score was -2.5 (range: -0.3 to -2.9). The mean TC was 65.4 +\/- 23.8 pg\/mL (normal value: 40-55 pg\/mL); the median AC was 18 pg\/mL (range: 2-56pg\/mL; normal value: 3-15 pg\/mL); and the mean FC was 41.8 +\/- 16.6 pg\/mL (normal value: 25-35 pg\/mL). Median serum FC:AC was 2.22 (range: 0.59-4.3; normal value: 4). A significantly higher AC and a lower FC:AC were observed in HD patients as compared with PD patients. No differences in TC and FC were observed when patients were grouped by dialysis modality, time on dialysis, or nutrition status. Total cholesterol was 200 mg\/dL or higher in 20 patients, and 25 patients showed elevated triglycerides (&gt; 150 mg\/dL). The latter patients had a higher AC than did the group of patients with triglycerides below 150 mg\/dL (AC: 22 pg\/mL and 12.5 pg\/mL respectively; Kruskal-Wallis p &lt; 0.003). We found TC levels to be high in this group of patients. However, the FC:AC ratio was lower than normal in all except in 1 patient. Elevated triglycerides were associated with elevated AC, suggesting carnitine insufficiency in our patients.","294":"Because of increased intensity of hurricanes in the Gulf Coast region of the United States, peritoneal dialysis (PD) programs have been disrupted and patients relocated temporarily following these catastrophic events. We describe the disaster planning, implementation, and follow-up that occurred in one such PD program in New Orleans following Hurricane Katrina. Each year at the beginning of the North American hurricane season, the PD program's disaster plan is reviewed by clinic staff and copies are distributed to patients. Patients are instructed to assemble a disaster kit and are provided with contact numbers for dialysis suppliers and for a PD program in their planned evacuation city. In July 2005, this disaster plan was tested when an early tropical storm and hurricane entered the Gulf and several patients briefly relocated or evacuated because of power loss and then returned without incident. However, when Hurricane Katrina, a category 5 storm, was predicted to strike the metropolitan area, patients were notified by telephone to evacuate, and contact information, including their evacuation city and telephone and cellular phone numbers, was obtained. Patients were also reminded to take all medications, bottled water, antibacterial soap, hand sanitizer, and 4-5 days of PD supplies. Following the storm, telephone and cellular phone services were severely disrupted. However, text messaging was available to contact patients to confirm safety and to provide further instructions. Arrangements with the major dialysis suppliers to ship emergency supplies to new locations were made by the PD nurse and the patients. Only 2 of 22 patients required hospitalization because of complications resulting from evacuation failure, contamination, and inability to perform dialysis for a prolonged period of time. Both of these patients were quickly released and have continued PD. Following the event, all patients remained on PD, and most have planned to return to their home PD program. Thorough preparation, planning, practice, and implementation and effective communication are necessary to prevent complications in PD patients who are affected by disasters. With advdnce preparation, maintenance of communication with health care providers, and planning for alternative sites of care, patients can be safely maintained on PD without complications following catastrophic natural disasters.","295":"On abdominal computed tomography scan for evaluation of hematuria, the index patient, a 23-year-old male, was found to have multiple renal cysts bilaterally. He had been on peritoneal dialysis for 6 years, complicated by intermittent episodes of exit-site infection and peritonitis. Over time, he developed recurrent urinary tract infection and nephrolithiasis with intermittent hematuria. His maintenance dose of recombinant erythropoietin was discontinued, and he maintained a normal hemoglobin level. Annual surveillance of the bilateral renal cysts with magnetic resonance imaging revealed development of a complex cystic mass that warranted further investigation. Following a urology consultation, laparoscopic nephrectomy was performed without complications and with minimal interruption of PD. Pathology evaluation revealed renal cell carcinoma within the renal parenchyma and multiple cystic structures consistent with acquired cystic kidney disease. No clear recommendations exist in the literature regarding continuation or interruption of PD in the perioperative period for planned nephrectomy, tumor resection, or other uncomplicated abdominal or retroperitoneal procedures. A perioperative management strategy for PD patients requiring abdominal or retroperitoneal surgery is outlined here. If these recommendations are followed, patients may continue PD with minimal interruption, preservation of the peritoneal membrane, and few complications.","296":"In the present study, we identified patients who had difficulties learning the minimum knowledge and skills required to carry out peritoneal dialysis (PD), and we compared the outcomes in this subgroup of patients with outcomes in the general PD population. We calculated the mean learning sessions needed by our total PD population during the training period. We then assigned patients to one of two groups according to the number of learning sessions they needed. Patients who required a number of sessions equal to or less than the mean were placed in the \"standard learning\" group; patients who required more sessions but who reached the minimum knowledge and skills were placed in the \"learning difficulties \" group. We compared these two groups in terms of age, sex, diabetes status, autonomy to perform PD, family support, education level, residual renal function, and Charlson comorbidity index. Outcomes on PD included time to first peritonitis episode, peritonitis rate, percentage of patients free of peritonitis during follow-up, survival time on PD, and transfer to hemodialysis. Patients with learning difficulties were older and had more comorbidities. Outcomes on PD in the learning difficulties group were similar to those in the standard learning group, except for time to first peritonitis.","297":"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death among people with chronic kidney disease. In this review, we provide an update on how the association between renal dysfunction and cardiovascular disease goes beyond traditional cardiac risk factors, and we consider some of the key studies that link renal dysfunction with the development of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Unique challenges facing clinicians that treat patients with end-stage renal disease, particularly patients on peritoneal dialysis, are discussed. The potential relationship between endothelial progenitor cells and the renal-cardiovascular relationship are explored. We propose that moderate-to-severe renal dysfunction should be considered a coronary artery disease equivalent and that further investigation needs to be conducted to understand this key relationship.","298":"Although numerous reports have shown that the use of icodextrin solution, as compared with conventional dextrose solutions, provides various clinical benefits, data on the impact of icodextrin solution on mortality and drop-out are sparse. In the present retrospective study, we compared clinical outcomes in a large cohort of patients prescribed either icodextrin or dextrose solution for the long dwell. A total of 7808 patients across Japan who were using Baxter peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions in 2004 were included in this cross-sectional analysis. Outcomes data were retrieved from the Baxter Japan database. The annual drop-out rate in the icodextrin group (8.9%) was significantly (p &lt; 0.0001) lower than that in the dextrose group (14.5%). The annual mortality rate was also lower (6.6% vs. 13.5%, p &lt; 0.0001). Using data from the 2000 report of the Japanese Society for Dialysis Therapy, the relative risk of death in the icodextrin group, regardless of PD duration, was consistently lower than that in hemodialysis patients. These results indicate that, in PD, the use of icodextrin solution (as compared with dextrose solution) significantly reduces both mortality and drop-out rate.","299":"We present here the case of a continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patient who developed sclerosing calcifying peritonitis with gross macroscopic calcification of the small bowel, a rare and life-threatening complication of sclerosing peritonitis. A 40-year-old female had been on CAPD for 7 years. A peritoneal biopsy during an open cholecystectomy for cholelithiasis showed sclerosing peritonitis, but the patient refused to change dialysis modality. She remained free of symptoms for 3 years, but then was admitted with cloudy effluent, abdominal pain, and referred pain to the left shoulder. A white blood cell count showed 25,000 cells\/microL, and a peritoneal cell count showed 1000 cells\/microL. An abdominal computed tomography scan was nondiagnostic. The patient was started on intraperitoneal antibiotics, but 3 days later she was taken for surgery because of acute abdomen. Laparotomy revealed a tanned and thickened peritoneum and a small bowel with significant fibrosis and foci of calcification on the antimesenteric surface. Enterectomy and primary anastomosis was performed. Pathology revealed extensive mural fibrosis, calcium deposition, and localized inflammatory infiltration of the small bowel. The patient developed an anastomotic leak and, despite a second operation, died in the intensive care unit from septic shock. Although some authors report successful outcomes in similar cases by using surgery or other treatments (parenteral nutrition, immunosuppression), or both, we urgently recommend that, if sclerosing calcifying peritonitis is diagnosed, the patient be switched promptly to hemodialysis.","300":"The preservation residual renal function (RRF) is important for adequacy of peritoneal dialysis. Oxidative stress from intravenous (IV) iron has been shown to cause renal damage. The effect of IV iron on RRF has not been studied. Here, we report our experience during April 1999-March 2005 of the effect of IV iron on RRF. The study group included 24 patients (9 men, 15 women). The mean age of the group was 61 +\/- 17.7 years. Diabetes mellitus and hypertension were the underlying cause of end-stage renal disease in 55% of the patients. We found serum creatinine, creatinine clearance, urea clearance, urine output, hemoglobin, transferrin saturation, and ferritin all to be statistically significantly different before and after administration of IV iron to the patients. However, the rate at which the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) declined over time did not change significantly when calculated for the period before and after the iron infusion, suggesting that the changes we observed after IV iron infusion were the result of the declining RRF--the rate of that decline being unaffected by the IV iron. Furthermore, the rate of GFR decline in this study was similar to that previously reported in our patients.","301":"Guidelines for the clinical care and management of intra-abdominal complications in patients transferred from peritoneal dialysis (PD) to hemodialysis (HD) are not well established. In this study, we analyzed the indications for transfer, presence of abdominal complications, and clinical outcome on HD of 26 patients who were followed up between 1996 and 2004. Laboratory and radiology data for the patients (computerized tomographic and ultrasonographic examinations performed during the transfer and annually thereafter) were collected retrospectively. The indications for transfer from PD to HD were peritonitis (19%), mechanical problems (39%), and ultrafiltration failure (42%). At the time of transfer, 11 patients had no intra-abdominal complications, 8 had intra-abdominal loculated fluid collection, and 7 had intra-abdominal free fluid. One year after transfer, intra-abdominal fluid collection was observed in 6 patients, 3 of whom received percutaneous drainage. Patients who had intra-abdominal complications at the time of transfer exhibited significantly lower albumin (p &lt; 0.01), higher levels of C-reactive protein (p &lt; 0.02), and erythropoietin resistance at the time of transfer (p &lt; 0.0001). During the first year after transfer, we observed a tendency toward an increase in albumin and a decrease in C-reactive protein level in the group that had complications, and yet nutritional interventions were still necessary in that group. A high ratio of intra-abdominal problems, which have adverse nutritional and inflammatory impacts, are seen after patients are transferred from peritoneal dialysis.","302":"We examined the effect of L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (OTZ) on peritoneal morphology and function of mesothelial cells in rats during peritoneal dialysis (PD). We implanted intraperitoneal catheters into 14 rats and injected the rats twice daily for 4 weeks with standard PD fluid (group C, control; n = 7) or PD fluid supplemented with OTZ 1 mmol\/L (group OTZ; n = 7). At the beginning and the end of the study, we collected samples of 4-hour dwell effluents from every rat under sterile conditions. We used those samples to test, in ex vivo conditions, the effect on primary cultures of rat peritoneal mesothelial cells with regard to synthesis of total protein and collagen in mesothelium. After 4 weeks, the rats were humanely killed, and glutathione peroxidase activity in erythrocytes was measured. Morphologic analysis of the peritoneal membrane was also performed. As compared with group OTZ, group C showed intraperitoneal adhesions that were more severe, a higher density of mesothelial cells, a higher density of peritoneal vessels, similar peritoneal thickness, lower activity of glutathione peroxidase, and greater ability of their dialysate effluent to induce synthesis of total proteins and collagen in cultured mesothelial cells. Relationships between various parameters were analyzed. We conclude that OTZ preserves peritoneal morphology and the function of mesothelial cells during PD.","303":"Measurement of patient outcome by mental and social indexes such as quality of life (QOL) in addition to survival is a growing trend. We examined the feasibility of using a single global QOL question in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. We also examined the relationship that QOL has with uremic symptoms and depression in these patients. During a clinic visit, each PD patient completed a single-question QOL measure (0-10 scale, 10 being best). Patients' symptoms were assessed using a 10-symptom checklist, with each symptom scored on a Likert scale of 0 (none) to 5 (severe). We evaluated for depression using two questions from the Primary Care Evaluation of Mental Disorders. Serum albumin, hemoglobin, and phosphorus were obtained, but only phosphorus was associated with QOL on univariate analysis (p = 0.05) and therefore included in the multivariate model. Results (checklist score, depression, phosphorus, age, diabetes, and race) were analyzed using a sequential multivariate analysis with QOL as the dependent variable. The study population consisted of 64 PD patients [mean age: 47 +\/- 16 years; 25% black; 23% with diabetes; 31% incident (&lt; or =3 months)]. The median score on the single QOL question was 7 (range: 1-10). Patients scored a median of 9 (range: 0-31) out of 50 on the total symptom checklist. Among responding patients, 34% answered yes to at least one depression question. The sequential incremental r2 values associated with a poorer QOL were higher checklist score (r2 = 0.16, p &lt; 0.02), presence of depression (r2 = 0.13, p &lt; 0.00002), younger age (r2 = 0.06, p &lt; 0.03), and presence of diabetes (r2 = 0.04, p &lt; 0.05). In this model, PO4 and race were nonsignificant. Total r2 in the model was 0.48. The single measure of QOL, the checklist score, and the depression screening score were simple and easy to obtain during a routine clinic visit. We conclude that physical symptoms and depression are strongly associated with a simple single measure of QOL. The extent to which symptoms and depression can be improved by clinical intervention, and the subsequent effect on quality of life and survival, should be examined in longitudinal studies.","304":"Fungal peritonitis (FP) is an infrequent cause of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis (PD), but it has high morbidity and mortality. We analyzed the experience with FP in a single PD unit over a 24-year period. We identified 671 episodes of peritonitis that occurred in 496 patients during the study period. Of these episodes, 23 (3.4%) were FP episodes occurring in 21 patients. In the FP episodes, the patients' mean time on PD was 29.2 +\/- 27 months. In 5 episodes, the patients had experienced a peritonitis episode within the preceding month, and in 11 episodes, the patients had used antibiotics within the preceding month. The FP diagnosis was made a mean of 3.17 +\/- 3 days after the diagnosis of peritonitis, and in 1 patient, the diagnosis was made after death. Candida spp. were isolated in 82.6% of patients. In 91.3%, the peritoneal catheter was removed. After the FP diagnosis, 15 patients dropped out of PD, but in only 8 patients (34.7%) was drop-out related to FP. In 4 patients, drop-out occurred because of peritoneal membrane failure, and 4 patients (17.4%) died. Time on PD was significantly higher in the group of patients that dropped out of PD because of the FP (45.7 +\/- 31 months vs. 19 +\/- 18 months, p = 0.02). Fungal peritonitis is a rare cause of peritonitis in PD patients, but it is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Longer time on PD is the main factor in technique failure and mortality.","305":"Despite a decreasing incidence, peritonitis remains an important cause of peritoneal dialysis (PD) technique failure and transfer to hemodialysis. Infection with Serratia spp. has been suggested to be associated with a poor technique outcome in PD. We examined the data at our center to see if patients with Serratia peritonitis had a similar poor outcome. In this retrospective study, we reviewed all PD patients who presented at our center with peritonitis from January 1996 to December 2003. The case records of patients in whom the infecting organism was identified as Serratia were evaluated. We recorded age at the time of peritonitis and at the start of PD, sex, presence of diabetes mellitus, PD modality at the time of peritonitis, and duration of PD before the onset of peritonitis. For each episode of peritonitis, we recorded the type and duration of antibiotic therapy and the outcome. Over the study period, 52% of all peritonitis episodes involved gram-positive organisms; 29%, gram-negative organisms; and 19%, other organisms. Serratia spp. accounted for 16 episodes (3.68%). These 16 episodes of peritonitis occurred in 12 patients, with 3 repeat infections and 1 relapsing infection. The distribution between the sexes was equal, and the median age at diagnosis was 67 years (range: 37-79 years). Four patients with diabetes accounted for 6 of the 16 episodes (37.5%). In 7 episodes (43.8%), a Serratia exit-site infection preceded the peritonitis. In 4 episodes, catheter removal was required. A fifth patient developed sepsis and died. Technique survival was therefore 68.8% (11 of 16 episodes). We also compared the outcomes of different initial antibiotic regimens. With an initial regimen based on cefazolin-ceftazidime, as suggested in the 2000 guidelines of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis, technique survival was 60% (3 of 5 episodes). When the initial regimen included an aminoglycoside, the technique survival was 80% (8 of 10 episodes). Serratia-induced peritonitis was associated with a technique survival of 68.8% at our center.","306":"In this report we present the history of a patient treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in whom episodes of hypotonia can be related to the administration of amikacin, an antibiotic from the aminoglycosides group. The 68-year-old female patient was admitted for initiation of renal replacement therapy with CAPD. Her renal failure was probably attributable to hypertension. Three days after catheter implantation, the patient reported dysuric symptoms, and a urine culture showed significant growth of Escherichia coli. Amikacin 250 mg and cefazolin 1.0 g were administered intravenously once daily in accordance with the antibiogram. On the third day of antibiotic administration, the patient fainted, showing an arterial blood pressure of 90\/60 mmHg. On the subsequent 2 days, decreases of postural arterial blood pressure to between 90\/60 mmHg and 80\/50 mmHg were reported two or three times daily. The patient was treated with antibiotics for the next 6 days and felt very bad the entire time, with an arterial blood pressure of 80\/50 mmHg. The patient's condition improved 2 days after discontinuation of treatment with antibiotics, and episodes of hypotonia stopped. The decrease in the arterial blood pressure observed in our patient during intravenous administration of amikacin can, with a high probability, be related to the calcimimetic activity of this aminoglycoside and the resulting inhibition of parathyroid secretion.","307":"Peritonitis is a serious complication in patients on peritoneal dialysis. We examined the efficacy of MTV therapy [first 7 days: meropenem 0.5 g intravenously (IV) twice daily, plus tobramycin 15 mg intraperitoneally (IP) in every dialysis bag; next 7 days: meropenem 0.5 g IV twice daily, plus vancomycin 8 mg\/kg IP in every bag after a 1-g loading dose] on peritonitis in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), comparing it with the treatment previously recommended by the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (combination of first-generation cephalosporins and aminoglycosides). We treated 36 CAPD peritonitis episodes with MTV therapy. Outcome measures were primary response rate at day 14 and relapse rate within 28 days after the start of antibiotic therapy. The primary response rate was 34\/36 (94.4%). No patients treated with MTV therapy required catheter removal. We observed no serious side effects in these patients. We conclude that MTV therapy may be an even better choice of treatment for peritonitis in patients on CAPD than was the previous empirical treatment (combination of first-generation cephalosporin and aminoglycosides).","308":"Since 1993, we have performed enterolysis for encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) in 86 patients. Five patients died after surgery, but the remaining 81 patients achieved symptomatic improvement. However, some of the surviving patients developed symptoms of intestinal obstruction after several months, and EPS recurrence remains our greatest challenge. In the present study, we identified factors related to recurrence by clinically comparing 47 recurrent and nonrecurrent patients that we were able to follow for more than 2 years after surgery. In the 47 patients we followed, 11 (23.4%) experienced recurrence, and 10 of those patients underwent a second surgery. Four patients needed a third surgery. The mean time to recurrence was 15.2 months, and all patients with recurrence, except one, experienced their recurrence within 20 months. We observed no differences between the recurrent and nonrecurrent patients in follow-up period, age, history of peritoneal dialysis, use or nonuse of steroids after surgery, thickness of the submesothelial compact zone, or inflammatory cell infiltration. However, the number of microvessels was significantly higher in the recurrent patients. Our surgical experience with EPS shows recurrence in approximately 23% of patients. The results of the present study suggest that peritoneal microvascular hyperplasia is a factor involved in recurrence, and that patients with recurrence may have an irreversible pathologic condition and may experience repeated recurrences.","309":"Fungal peritonitis is a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). This retrospective study evaluated patients with fungal peritonitis in our dialysis unit from December 1999 through September 2003. We analyzed the demographic and clinical characteristics of patients to identify possible risk factors. Main clinical outcomes of interest were technique survival and mortality. During the study period, 18 patients were diagnosed with fungal peritonitis (15 on continuous ambulatory PD, 3 on automated PD). Fungal peritonitis accounted for 6% of all peritonitis episodes during the study period. Candida species were the infecting organism in 15 patients (83%). All 18 patients received antifungal treatment according to the International Society of Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) recommendations that were current during the study period. Two patients (11%) died with the PD catheter in situ, and 1 patient died after dialysis was withdrawn because of deterioration in other comorbid conditions. All the surviving patients were switched to hemodialysis. Of the 18 patients, 15 (83%) had history of antibiotic treatment for bacterial peritonitis within the 4 weeks preceding the fungal peritonitis episode. Our study provides further support for the current ISPD recommendation that the PD catheter should be removed as soon as a diagnosis of fungal peritonitis is made in a patient.","310":"The timing of the first episode of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis (PD) might have some special characteristics and may depend on many factors such as a patient's attitudes, age, comorbidity, or training capacity. It may also have a significant impact on further peritonitis episodes and technique failure. We retrospectively analyzed data for 168 PD patients who were undergoing continuous ambulatory PD by a twin-bag system, automated PD, or in-center intermittent PD over 12 years. There were 121 cases of peritonitis recorded in 60 patients, with an overall peritonitis rate of 1 episode per 45.75 patient-months. The mean time to the first episode of peritonitis after commencement of PD was 26.4 +\/- 22 months (range: 1-110 months). In 20 patients, a first peritonitis episode presented rather early--during the first 12 months on PD (group A)--and in 27 patients, a first episode presented rather late-after at least 24 months on PD (group B). Group A had lower technique survival (30.4 +\/- 26.5 months), were more prone to further episodes of peritonitis during follow-up, and had a total peritonitis rate of 1 episode per 14.85 patient-months. In group B, technique survival was longer (69.3 +\/- 33.8 months), and the total peritonitis rate was 1 episode per 45.68 patient-months. We observed no differences between the two groups in comorbidity, age, or PD modality. These results indicate that patients with early-onset peritonitis are prone to making mistakes during connection, resulting usually in infection with gram-positive pathogens. These patients may present repeated peritonitis episodes and experience decreased technique survival.","311":"Although advances have been made in the treatment and prevention of peritoneal dialysis (PD) peritonitis, these infections are still a significant source of technique failure, morbidity, and mortality in the end-stage renal disease population. Currently, it is unclear whether PD patients who experience an episode of peritonitis early in the course of their therapy are more vulnerable to the complications of peritonitis. Using retrospective data collected at the Toronto General Hospital Home Peritoneal Dialysis Unit between January 1, 1998, and December 31, 2004, we compared technique and patient outcomes between PD patients developing \"early-onset\" peritonitis and a matched control group of PD patients. \"Early-onset\" peritonitis was defined as peritonitis occurring within 3 months of PD catheter insertion. Outcomes included survival on PD or the combined endpoint of technique failure (transfer to hemodialysis) or death. The early-onset cohort was younger than the control group and had a higher peritonitis rate (1.18 episodes vs. 0.28 episodes per patient-year). Gram-positive micro-organisms, particularly coagulase-negative staphylococci, were the most common cause of peritonitis. At the conclusion of the study, 8 patients (38.1%) in the early-onset cohort had transferred to hemodialysis, 2 patients (9.5%) had died of cardiac complications, and 11 patients (52.4%) remained on PD. The combined rate of technique failure and death in the early-onset group was almost twice as high as that in the control group (0.282 vs. 0.175 per patient-year). Time to the composite end-point of technique failure or death did not significantly differ between the two groups (p = 0.26). In summary, there is an important trend toward increased death and technique failure in PD patients who develop peritonitis early in the course of their PD therapy.","312":"Although erythropoietin (EPO) derivatives improve anemic status in most end-stage renal disease patients, some EPO-resistant patients remain. Asialo-type EPO is as effective as is native EPO in vitro, but in vivo, it is quickly trapped by the hepatic asialo receptors. Alkaline phosphatase (ALP) also binds to the asialo receptor for degradation. We compared hematologic indices in 27 stable PD patients 1-3 months before and after the start of icodextrin solution. In selected patients, we also performed imaging with 99m-technetium-labeled galactosyl serum albumin (GSA) for asialo receptors. Resistance to EPO was defined as a hematocrit below 30% concurrent with EPO administration of more than 18,000 IU monthly. In 19 patients without EPO resistance started on icodextrin, the average hematocrit level did not change (-1.2%), and the average ALP activity increased 36%. But in 8 patients with EPO resistance, the average hematocrit level increased by 12% (p = 0.03 as compared with baseline), and ALP activity increased by 79% (p = 0.02 as compared to non EPO resistant cases) after icodextrin introduction. In the patients with marked elevation of ALP activity, GSA scintigraphy showed inhibition of tracer binding. These results indicate that improvement in EPO-resistant anemia and greater ALP activity with icodextrin administration are mediated through blockade of the asialo receptors on hepatocytes.","313":"In patients on long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, the efficiency of dialysis declines because of peritoneal neovascularization and loss of peritoneal mesothelial cells. In this study, we investigated the influence of lactate and bicarbonate in peritoneal dialysis fluid on such changes of the peritoneum. We studied the production of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), which induce peritoneal neovascularization, by human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) cultured with lactate or bicarbonate or both. Lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) was also measured to assess cell necrosis. Levels of VEGF, bFGF, and LDH in the culture supernatant showed a significant decrease after incubation of HPMCs with 15 mEq\/L lactate plus 25 mEq\/L bicarbonate, or with 40 mEq\/L bicarbonate, as compared with incubation with 40 mEq\/L lactate. Levels of VEGF and bFGF showed a concentration-dependent decrease when the cells were incubated with lactate or bicarbonate; a concentration-dependent increase of LDH was simultaneously observed. These results suggest that dialysis fluid containing 40 mEq\/L bicarbonate is superior to fluid containing 40 mEq\/L lactate with regard to its influence on the production of VEGF and bFGF although lactate and bicarbonate are both toxic for HPMCs.","314":"Patients returning to peritoneal dialysis (PD) from failed renal transplantation are recognized to be inflamed, and this situation might produce a high peritoneal solute transport status. We wanted to determine if a period of time with a kidney allograft induces a change in peritoneal function. We studied 19 PD patients who had been living with a graft for a mean of 47 +\/- 39 months. We studied their peritoneal function upon starting PD (baseline), immediately before transplantation (pre-Tx), and after returning to PD when the graft failed (post-Tx). We analyzed the peritoneal mass transfer coefficients for urea (U-MTAC) and creatinine (Cr-MTAC), the dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creatinine (D\/P-Cr), and net ultrafiltration (UF). We observed no significant differences in the various variables pre-Tx and post-Tx. The U-MTAC post-Tx was significantly lower than at PD baseline (25.9 +\/- 8 mL\/min vs. 20.2 +\/- 5 mL\/min, p = 0.03). The U-MTAC and Cr-MTAC post-Tx were not correlated with months on a graft or with MTAC values at baseline. In inherent high transporters (Cr-MTAC &gt; or = 11.5 mL\/min at baseline, n = 8), we observed a significant reduction in Cr-MTAC post-Tx (15.2 +\/- 2 mL\/min vs. 10.2 +\/- 4 mL\/min, p = 0.03). Three of these patients remained high transporters post-Tx. We conclude that peritoneal function upon reinitiating PD after transplantation is similar to function in the pre-transplantation phase; and that a high peritoneal transport status is more prevalent at first initiation onto PD than at return after transplantation, suggesting that inherently high transport is almost exclusively a feature of an intact, predialysis peritoneum.","315":"In patients with end-stage renal disease on peritoneal dialysis, the peritoneum is effectively utilized as an endogenous semipermeable membrane. Chemical agents may alter the structure of the peritoneum and induce changes in its transfer properties. The purpose of our in vitro study was to compare the influence of sodium hyaluronan (a cytoprotective glycosaminoglycan, 2000 kDa, 40 mg\/dL) and sodium deoxycholate (an intense oxidative stress factor, 414 Da, 104 mg\/dL) on the transfer of insulin (5.8 kDa, 100 mg\/dL) and albumin (68 kDa, 1000 mg\/dL) through isolated rabbit parietal peritoneum. We used a mathematical model to calculate the transport rate of solutes from the interstitial to the mesothelial side of peritoneal membrane (I--&gt;M) and in the opposite direction (M--&gt;I) in three separate series of experiments: Control conditions without chemical agents Before (15-60 minutes) and after (75-120 minutes) introduction of sodium hyaluronan into the experimental system Before (15 -75 minutes) and after (90-150 minutes) introduction of sodium deoxycholate into the experimental system The results are expressed as a diffusive permeability coefficient P in centimeters per second. During the 120 minutes of the control stage, the rate of insulin and albumin bidirectional passage remained constant. Values of P +\/- standard error of the mean did not correlate with the molecular weight of the compounds and measured 0.145 +\/- 0.033 x 0.0001 cm\/s and 0.146 +\/- 0.022 x 0.0001 cm\/s for insulin, and 0.271 +\/- 0.056 x 0.0001 cm\/s and 0.315 +\/- 0.057 x 0.0001 cm\/s for albumin in the I--&gt;M and M--&gt;I transport directions respectively. Application of sodium hyaluronan did not change the bidirectional transport of either solute. However sodium deoxycholate caused the values of P to increase by 142% (p &lt; 0.05) for insulin I--&gt;M transfer and by 102% (p &lt; 0.02) for insulin M--&gt;I transport. Albumin passage increased by 193% (p &lt; 0.01) for both transfer directions. We conclude that, in vitro, sodium deoxycholate but not sodium hyaluronan increases the bidirectional peritoneal transport of insulin and albumin. In the case of larger molecular weight solutes, the modification is greater.","316":"The usefulness of icodextrin-containing peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution for the management of body fluid and blood pressure has been reported. However, icodextrin PD solution is a foreign solution in the body, and the possible induction of intraperitoneal inflammation has been reported. In this study, we investigated at 6-month intervals the influence of icodextrin solution on peritoneal permeability and inflammatory reactions in patients in whom glucose solution had been changed to icodextrin solution for the overnight dwell. We enrolled 9 anuric PD patients (5 men, 4 women) of mean age 58 +\/- 5.9 years (range: 45.6-64.8 years) into the study. The patients' mean duration of PD was 61.9 +\/- 42 months (range: 6.7-142.5 months). The cause of end-stage renal disease was chronic glomerulonephritis in all patients. For evaluation ofperitoneal permeability, we performed peritoneal equilibration tests (PETs) immediately after an overnight dwell and determined the dialysate-to-plasma ratios of creatinine (D\/P Cr), beta2-microglobulin (D\/P beta2m), albumin (D\/P Alb), immunoglobulin G (D\/P IgG), and alpha2-macroglobulin (D\/P alpha2m). We also measured interleukin-6 (IL-6) and fibrinogen degradation products (FDPs) in overnight effluent as indices of inflammation and of the fibrinolysis-coagulation system. The evaluation was performed every 6 months for 24 months. The FDPs in effluent increased significantly at 6 months after the change to icodextrin solution, and IL-6 tended to increase. The D\/P beta2m, D\/P Alb, D\/P IgG, and D\/P alpha2m all significantly increased in the course of follow-up. In the PETs, the D\/P Cr increased slightly, but the change was nonsignificant. At 30 months after the change to icodextrin solution, 1 patient was diagnosed as having a risk of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (pre-EPS). In this patient, rapid increases in IL-6, D\/P Cr and macromolecular and small molecular D\/P by PET were noted after the change to icodextrin solution. Steroids were administered after the diagnosis of pre-EPS, with the result that the IL-6 level rapidly decreased and the D\/P Cr and D\/P of small molecules and macromolecules slightly decreased. Icodextrin dialysis solution increased peritoneal permeability. Although the cause was unclear, icodextrin may have changed peritoneal reactivity. Long-term use of icodextrin PD solution requires further investigation.","317":"Many patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) receive antihypertensive agents, including calcium antagonists, which produce reflex tachycardia through activation of the sympathetic nervous system. Azelnidipine, a newly developed calcium antagonist, has unique characteristics in that it causes less reflex stimulation of the sympathetic nervous system. In the present study, we used a crossover method to compare the effects of amlodipine (5-10 mg daily) and azelnidipine (8-16 mg daily) on drain volume and weekly creatinine clearance in 9 CAPD patients (3 women, 6 men; mean age: 64 +\/- 5 years; mean duration of CAPD: 1.8 +\/- 0.6 years). Each calcium antagonist was administered for 3 months and then switched for the other. As compared with amlodipine, azelnidipine increased drain volume by 13% +\/- 2% (p &lt; 0.05) and weekly creatinine clearance by 12% +\/- 2% (p &lt; 0.05). At the same time, we observed no significant differences in blood pressure and urine volume. The increases in drain volume produced by azelnidipine resulted from less activation of the sympathetic nervous system. We therefore suggest that activation of the sympathetic nervous system induced by calcium antagonists may be important in the regulation of drain volume in CAPD patients.","318":"At the beginning of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), different patients exhibit large differences in peritoneal permeability. To determine if early estimation of peritoneal permeability can predict the prognosis of CAPD, we used data from a personal dialysis capacity (PDC) study group in Japan to investigate patient and technique survival rates. Based on the data from a previously reported, prospective multicenter study encompassing eight dialysis centers in Japan (Am J Kidney Dis 2002; 40:1045-54), we recalculated patient and technique survival data. We reviewed the records of 139 patients newly initiated on CAPD from January 1995 to December 1999. Peritoneal permeability was estimated by PDC test within the first year after initiation. We divided the patients into paired groups according to several peritoneal permeability variables as calculated by the PDC test (area, plasma loss, and peritoneal creatinine clearance), and we compared patient and technique survival rate between the groups. The mean age of the patients was 49.6 years +\/- 14.9 years (standard deviation). The mean pore area of peritoneum was 19,936 +\/- 8383 cm\/1.73 m2. Estimation of patient survival by the Kaplan-Meier method showed 94.2%, 88.4%, 84.1%, and 79.7% at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years respectively. Estimated technique survival (including death as an endpoint) by the Kaplan-Meier method showed 90.6%, 76.8%, 67.4%, and 54.3% at 1, 2, 3, and 5 years respectively. In the high peritoneal permeability group (high area and high plasma loss), the technique survival at 5 years was significantly lower than in the low peritoneal permeability group [area: 55.9% (high) vs. 72.7% (low), p = 0.0459; plasma loss: 43.3% (high) vs. 62.8% (low), p = 0.0197). We observed no significant difference in patient survival between the high and low peritoneal permeability patients. In the high peritoneal creatinine clearance group, patient and technique survival were both significantly lower than in the high peritoneal creatinine clearance group. Patients with high peritoneal permeability as calculated by the PDC test at the start of PD had a poor prognosis for technique and patient survival on CAPD. We conclude that early estimation of high peritoneal permeability can predict poor outcome for patients on CAPD.","319":"The peritoneal mesothelium is a barrier to ion transport in peritoneal dialysis. In this study, we used Ussing-chamber experiments to investigate the effect of HgCl2, an aquaporin-1 inhibitor, on the transmesothelial electrical resistance (RTM) of isolated sheep parietal peritoneum. Peritoneal samples from the diaphragm of adult sheep were isolated immediately after the death of the animal and were transferred within 30 minutes to the laboratory in a cooled Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (4 degrees C, pH 7.5) bubbled with 95% O(2)\/5% CO2. A planar sheet of the parietal peritoneum was mounted in an Ussing-type chamber and HgCl2 (10(-4) mol\/L) was added apically or basolaterally. The RTM was measured before and serially after the addition of the HgCl2. The entire experimental apparatus was held at 37 degrees C, because active ion transport is temperature-dependent. The results presented are the mean +\/- standard error of 12 experiments. The control RTM (that is, before the addition of HgCl) was 19.3 +\/- 0.38 omega x cm2. Addition of HgCl2 apically induced a decrease in the RTM to 16.25 +\/- 0.86 omega x cm2 within 1 minute. When added basolaterally, HgCl2 action was similar, with a rapid reduction in the RTM to 18.1 +\/- 0.51 omega x cm2 (p &lt; 0.05). A clear association between the RTM and the active transmesothelial ion transport was shown in previous studies. In the present study, rapid action of HgCl2 on the permeability ofthe parietal peritoneum was observed, resulting in a reduction in the RTM Taken together, these findings indicate that inhibition of aquaporin-1 alters the ionic permeability of the parietal peritoneal membrane.","320":"Inflammation, dialysis adequacy, and peritoneal transport rate (PTR) influence clinical outcomes in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The present study examined the relationship of C-reactive protein (CRP), a marker of inflammation, to PTR and residual renal function (RRF) in PD patients. We recorded the baseline dialysate-to-plasma creatinine (D\/P Cr) of 210 PD patients starting in 1986. In a subgroup of 42 patients, we serially measured high-sensitivity CRP levels and.dialysis adequacy, including weekly Kt\/V urea and creatinine clearance (CCr), starting in May 2003. The patients were followed to January 2006. Mean age was 53 +\/- 16 (standard deviation) years, and 70% of the patients were African American. Enrollment mean and median CRP levels were 13.53 +\/- 20.8 (range: 0.2-95.8) and 7.15 mg\/L respectively. Mean weekly residual CCr and Kt\/V during follow-up were 7.11 +\/- 15.47 L\/1.73 m2 and 0.14 +\/- 0.30 respectively. The mean enrollment D\/P Cr was 0.649 +\/- 0.12 (range: 0.429-0.954). Patients with CRP &gt; 10 mg\/L had significantly lower weekly residual CCr (0.59 L\/1.73 m2 vs. 10.1 L\/1.73 m2, p = 0.01), residual Kt\/V (0.01 vs. 0.20, p = 0.01), total CCr (56 L\/1.73 m2 vs. 62 L\/1.73 m2, p= 0.047), and total Kt\/V (2.09 vs. 2.49, p = 0.001) than did those with CRP &lt; or = 10 mg\/L. Levels of CRP correlated negatively with weekly residual CCr (r = -0.42, p = 0.006), residual Kt\/V (r = -0.43, p = 0.006), and total Kt\/V (r = -0.44, p = 0.004). Enrollment D\/P Cr was inversely correlated with serum albumin (r = -0.24, p = 0.001) and directly correlated with peritoneal protein loss (r = 0.34, p = 0.028). Higher enrollment D\/P Cr was associated with lower observed cumulative survival (Kaplan-Meier) in PD patients. However D\/P Cr was not an independent predictor of long-term survival in PD patients. Using multivariate Cox regression analysis, and including D\/P Cr and residual Kt\/V in the model, enrollment CRP was an independent predictor of mortality (relative risk = 1.036, p = 0.018). We conclude that elevated CRP is associated with lower RRF As a predictor of mortality, CRP may be better than RRF and D\/P Cr.","321":"","322":"In acute renal failure (ARF) in the setting of a pediatric intensive care unit, most authors report the use of frequent cycles of (often low-volume) high-glucose solutions. That approach results in appropriate H2O ultrafiltration, but not in appropriate sodium removal, as a consequence of the sieving coefficient of sodium. That in turn leads not only to inefficient treatment of intravascular fluid overload, but also frequently to hypernatremia. The problem can be resolved by the use of low-sodium (127 mmol\/L) dialysis solution. In the present prospective study in children, we performed peritoneal dialysis using a pharmacy-made solution containing 127 mmol\/L sodium and 3.86% glucose, comparing that solution with conventional glucose solution. We calculated the ultrafiltration rate and the sodium removal. We observed no statistical difference in ultrafiltration rate, but a significantly increased sodium extraction. Children with acute overload during ARF may benefit if low-sodium solution is used in place of conventional dialysate. A low-sodium solution does not attenuate the pure ultrafiltration rate, but does result in higher sodium extraction, reducing intravascular volume and plasma sodium levels.","323":"Catheter-related complications--including infection, dialysate leak, subcutaneous leak, outflowfailure, and malfunction--are the principal causes of peritoneal dialysis (PD) failure. In the present retrospective study, we evaluated the catheter-related complications that occurred in children at our facility who were started on chronic PD during the period from July 1997 to August 2004. During the study period, 72 catheters were placed in 53 patients (28 girls, 25 boys). The average follow-up period was 29.4 + 19.3 months. Catheter-related complications developed in 41 patients. The risk for subcutaneous dialysate leak was no more significant when PD catheters were used early (&lt; or = 7 days post placement) than when use was delayed (&gt;7 days). Similarly, no significant difference was observed in the infection rate between the early- and delayed-use groups. During the study, 87 episodes of peritonitis occurred in 39 patients (1 episode \/ 18 patient-months). The infection rate was significantly different (p &lt; 0.05) in patients with a low serum albumin level. No significant difference was seen between the early--and delayed--use groups in dialysis duration or number of catheter changes. However, we did observe a significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) in subcutaneous leaks with longer dialysis duration. No correlation was observed between early or delayed catheter use and infection, dialysate leak, hernia, or subcutaneous leak. In conclusion, we observed no significant differences in catheter-related complications between early- and delayed-use catheter groups. A low serum albumin level appears to be a risk factor for infection after PD catheter placement.","324":"Daytime exchanges with glucose osmotic agents often lead to dialysate reabsorption, poor ultrafiltration (UF), positive sodium balance, and restricted purification of uremic toxins. We studied 5 anuric children on continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (mean age: 10 years, 10 months), comparing icodextrin to a conventional glucose-based dialysate. The same fill volume (980 +\/- 290 mL\/m2) and the same dwell duration (720 minutes) were used with both solutions for the daytime exchange. In a crossover design, we compared 7.5% icodextrin with 1.36% glucose, and then 1.36% glucose with 7.5% icodextrin. Tolerance, net UF, sodium balance, and solute extraction were analyzed. The Student t-test for paired data was used for statistical analysis. The drained volume was 44% +\/- 18% higher during icodextrin exchanges, allowing a mean enhanced sodium extraction of 44 +\/- 15 mmol per daytime exchange. The uremic toxin extraction capacity was enhanced under icodextrin: weekly Kt\/V urea increased by 0.41 +\/- 0.1, weekly creatinine clearance increased by 8.4 +\/- 3.6 L\/1.73 m2, and phosphate removal increased by 23%. Similarly, beta2-microglobulin extraction increased with icodextrin use. Dialysate protein loss under icodextrin increased from 1.3 +\/- 0.6 g to 1.9 +\/- 0.96 g per daytime exchange. Icodextrin improved ultrafiltration and purification capacities (urea, creatinine, phosphate, beta2-microglobulin), but the large drained volume directly affected dialysate protein loss.","325":"Osteoclast function is important in the development of renal osteodystrophy (ROD). Osteoclast activity is modulated by the osteoprotegerin ligand-osteoprotegerin (OPGL\/OPG) system. In the present study, we checked levels of serum OPG and soluble OPGL in dialyzed patients and correlated those levels with routinely measured parameters of bone metabolism. The study was carried out in 39 patients on hemodialysis (HD) and 29 on peritoneal dialysis (PD). The control group included 13 healthy volunteers. Patients on HD had lower OPGL (p = 0.027) and higher OPG (p = 0.000) levels than control subjects did [OPGL: 0.6 pmol\/L (median) and 0.0 - 10.0 pmolL (range) vs. 1.9 pmo1\/L (median) and 0.0 - 10.5 pmol\/L (range); OPG: 7.7 pmol\/L (median) and 0.9 - 16.5 pmol\/L (range) vs. 2.2 pmol\/L (median) and 1.0- 3.9 pmol\/L (range)]. Patients on PD differed from controls only in OPG level [4.0 pmol\/L (median) and 2.1 - 13.4 pmol\/L (range), p = 0.043]. Patients on HD and on PD both had a lower OPGL\/OPG ratio than did the control subjects [HD: 0.09 (median) and 0.00 - 1.45 (range), p = 0.000; PD: 0.35 (median) and 0.00 - 3.89 (range), p = 0.018; controls: 1.07 (median) and 0.00 - 5.14 (range)]. Patients on HD did not differ from patients on PD in levels of OPGL and OPGL\/OPG, but they had a higher OPG level (p = 0.001). Patients on HD also showed significantly higher total alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and higher inorganic phosphate (iP), but lower total calcium and blood pH. In PD patients, OPGL and OPG both correlated with pH (OPGL positively and OPG negatively). In HD patients, OPGL showed a positive correlation with ALP and a negative correlation with calcium; OPG correlated positively with iP In 36 patients on HD (92.3%) and 15 patients on PD (51.7%), OPG was elevated above the normal value. Differences in serum OPG and OPGL\/OPG ratio between groups of dialyzed patients and of control subjects indicate that ROD is more advanced in HD patients than in PD patients. Higher serum OPG and lower serum OPGL in the HD group is probably an effect of higher osteoclast activity. In about 50% of PD patients, osteoclast function is also disturbed, as indicated by elevated OPG levels.","326":"Acidosis is responsible for catabolic state in dialysis patients and should be avoided or corrected. The survival of patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) is as good as that of patients on hemodialysis--if not better-mainly because PD patients are rarely in an acidotic-catabolic state as compared with hemodialysis patients. We investigated whether the use of sevelamer in PD patients contributes to significant acidosis as has been reported in the hemodialysis population. We compared serum bicarbonate in 12 PD patients on sevelamer and 77 PD patients not on that drug. Residual renal function, serum phosphate, and daily intake of calcium phosphate binder were also recorded. Patients on PD who take sevelamer maintain a serum bicarbonate level in the normal range as compared with hemodialysis patients, who frequently become acidotic. Serum bicarbonate is only slightly lower in PD patients taking sevelamer than in those not taking that drug.","327":"Bone turnover is regulated by local concentrations of cytokines such as osteoprotegerin (OPG) and receptor activator of nuclear factor kappaB ligand (RANKL). It is not known whether these cytokines can predict renal osteodystrophy in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. We measured serum levels of OPG, RANKL, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), calcium, phosphorus, and biologic parameters of bone turnover [carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) and beta-crosslaps (betaCL)] in 21 PD patients and 42 healthy subjects matched for age and sex, who served as controls. Bone mineral density (BMD) was also evaluated (Z-scores) in the PD patients. Circulating levels of OPG were significantly higher in PD patients than in healthy subjects (p &lt; 0.001). Mean levels of RANKL did not differ from normal. However, RANKL levels were increased in the group of patients with iPTH levels above 322 pg\/mL. Biologic parameters of bone turnover (PICP and betaCL) were significantly increased in PD patients (p &lt; 0.001). We found a positive correlation between serum levels of betaCL and iPTH. At several skeletal sites, betaCL also correlated with the BMD Z-score. No correlations were observed between OPG, RANKL, PICP, betaCL, CaxP, or time on dialysis. Circulating levels of OPG and RANKL do not reflect bone status in PD patients. The value of betaCL is a good marker of bone resorption that correlates with iPTH and BMD.","328":"We performed the present study to determine dialysis adequacy targets for improved clinical outcome in elderly chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Since 1993, 19 elderly patients (14 men, 5 women; 5 with diabetes, 14 without diabetes; mean age: 78.9 +\/- 7.0 years; median time on PD: 47.7 months) at our center have been treated mainly with automated PD. Using the PD-NAVI software (JMS, Hiroshima, Japan), we measured the patients' peritoneal equilibration test (PET), Kt\/V urea (Kt\/V), creatinine clearance (CCr), and ultrafiltration (UF). The nutrition status of the patients was estimated by subjective global assessment (SGA), percentage creatinine generation rate (%CrGR), serum albumin, and ratio of extracellular fluid to total body water (ECF.TBW). For these patients, we particularly focused on reducing intra-abdominal pressure in the daytime. Despite lesser dwell volumes in the daytime, optimal prescriptions were reached by using the PD-NAVI simulation software to increase the nightly volume. All patients showed good SGA grades (A and B) with the modified prescriptions developed using PD-NAVI. Dialysis dose and nutrition parameters were as follows: dwell volume, 8.2 +\/- 1.6 L\/day; weekly Kt\/V, 2.12 +\/- 0.3; weekly CCr, 61.9 +\/- 9.1 L; total UF, 891 +\/- 157 mL\/day; %CrGR, 119.1% +\/- 18.4%; serum albumin, 3.5 +\/- 0.3 g\/dL; and ECF:TBW, 0.364 +\/- 0.01. Overall patient survival was 82% at 135 months. Prescriptions for chronic PD that achieve adequate solute removal and sufficient UF, produce good clinical outcomes and good nutrition status in elderly patients.","329":"In peritoneal dialysis (PD), a 7.5% polyglucose-containing dialysis solution (icodextrin) provides prolonged ultrafiltration as compared with glucose-based dialysis solutions. In the present study, we attempted to clarify the safety and effectiveness of icodextrin in elderly patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Clinical data and outcomes of 16 patients aged 65 or older were monitored for 12 weeks before and during icodextrin treatment. The group included 13 men and 3 women with a mean age of 69 +\/- 5 years (range: 66-78 years). The underlying kidney disease was chronic nephritis in 7 patients, diabetes mellitus in 8 patients, and nephrosclerosis in I patient. From the beginning of peritoneal dialysis, 1 patients had been treated with icodextrin; the other 10 were changed to icodextrin from glucose dialysis solution. At the end of study, body weight had increased to 63.8 +\/- 9.3 kg from 61.6 +\/- 9.3 kg, accompanied by an increase in ultrafiltration to 480 +\/- 207 mL daily from 369 +\/- 436 mL daily. No significant change in urine volume occurred. Despite the increase in body weight, cardiothoracic rate decreased to 51.1% +\/- 3.4% from 52.3% +\/- 4.9%. All patients reported an improvement of edema and appetite. Edema scores were significantly decreased to 0.85 +\/- 0.90 from 1.63 +\/- 0.96 (p &lt; 0.03). No adverse side effects were associated with the use of icodextrin. From the foregoing data, we concluded that, as compared with conventional glucose solution, icodextrin has beneficial effects on ultrafiltration volume and clinical symptoms in elderly patients on CAPD.","330":"Using a retrospective cohort study, we evaluated survival and mortality risk factors in our dialysis population at the Renal Unit, RTS Cauca--Nephrologic San Jose, Popaydn, Cauca, Colombia. In the study, we included patients with chronic renal failure who started dialysis therapy during the period 1994-1999, and who remained on dialysis for a minimum of 5 years. Endpoints (living, died, lost to follow-up) were evaluated at the end of the study (July 2004), and a Kaplan-Meier survival analysis was performed. Mortality risk was analyzed using the multivariate Cox proportional hazard model. The study included 236 patients (129 on peritoneal dialysis and 107 on hemodialysis), whose mean age (+\/- standard deviation) was 54.5 +\/- 15.6 years. Of the group, 51% were women, 68.7% were urban dwellers, and 31.3% were rural dwellers. Major causes of end-stage renal disease included chronic glomerulonephritis (43.2%), diabetic nephropathy (35.7%), and hypertensive nephropathy (6.0%). The racial origins of the study population were half-caste (80.7%), Afro-Colombian (8.8%), indigenous (7.6%), and white (2.6%). Median (+ standard error) survival on hemodialysis was 66 +\/- 10 months. Median survival on peritoneal dialysis was 57 +\/- 7 months. Among patients with diabetes, median survival on hemodialysis was 40 +\/- 13 months, and on peritoneal dialysis, it was 38 +\/- 4 months. Major causes of mortality included sudden death (40%), infection (25%), and cardiovascular causes (22.5%). Significant mortality risk factors for hemodialysis patients were congestive heart failure (p = 0.01) and albumin &lt;3 g\/dL (p = 0.01). For peritoneal dialysis patients, the significant risk factors were diabetes mellitus (p = 0.01) and albumin &lt; 2.5 g\/dL (p = 0.02). Patient survival in our setting is similar to that reported in other series. The strongest predictive factors for mortality were diabetes mellitus, congestive heart failure, anemia, and hypoalbuminemia.","331":"Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-related renal disease is the third-leading cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) among African Americans aged 20-64 years. The number of HIV-infected (HIV+) patients reaching ESRD will increase exponentially over the next decade. Because of significant improvements in therapy and management during the last ten years, survival of HIV+ patients has improved. The survival experience of very long-term HIV+ peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients remains to be investigated. The objective of the present study was to examine the important differences in clinical and laboratory parameters between HIV+ and HIV-negative (HIV-) PD patients. To assess the factors associated with better survival in HIV+ PD patients, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of 488 PD patients, including 53 HIV+ patients, for the period 1987 to September 2004. We collected demographic, clinical, and laboratory data, including CD4 cell counts and history of hospitalizations and peritonitis. Maximum survival of HIV+ PD patients was 12.5 years as compared with 15.87 years in HIV-patients. Not surprisingly, HIV was a strong independent predictor of mortality in PD patients [relative risk (RR) = 3.09, p &lt; 0.0001]. In HIV+ patients, higher CD4 counts at the initiation of dialysis were strongly associated with better survival (RR = 0.10 and p &lt; 0.0001, &gt; or =200 cells\/mm3 vs. &lt; or =50 cells\/mm3). In univariate analysis, use of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) was associated with significantly improved survival in HIV+ PD patients. Patients treated with I or 2 drugs had a 4.3-times higher mortality risk than those who received HAART therapy (p = 0.012). Independent associations were seen between HIV and younger age, African American race, male sex, and lower serum albumin. The rates of hospitalization (p &lt; 0.0001) and peritonitis (p &lt; 0.01) were significantly higher in HIV+ patients than in HIV-patients. Very long-term survival of HIV+ patients with chronic renal failure is possible on PD therapy. Morbidity and mortality of these patients may be improved with HAART therapy, better nutrition, and treatment of peritonitis.","332":"An elevated level of C-reactive protein (CRP), which is a marker of inflammation, is a risk factor for morbidity and mortality in the general population and in dialysis patients. Recently, the relationship between inflammation and nutrition status has received much attention. Serum prealbumin is a highly sensitive marker of nutrition and survival in dialysis patients. The objective of the present study was to evaluate the prognostic value and clinical correlates of CRP in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Using retrospective chart review, we collected demographic, clinical, and laboratory data on 66 PD patients for the period June 2001 to January 2005. High-sensitivity CRP (hs-CRP) levels were measured in a subgroup of 32 patients starting in May 2003. Over the study period, prealbumin and CRP were assayed serially by the immunoturbidimetric method. Mean age (+\/- standard deviation) of the patients was 55 +\/- 15 years, and 73% were African American. Mean and median enrollment CRP were 15.2 +\/- 24 mg\/L (range: 4.2 - 149.5 mg\/L) and 6.45 mg\/L respectively. Mean and median enrollment hs-CRP were 15.3 +\/- 23.5 mg\/L (range: 0.2 - 96 mg\/L) and 6.55 mg\/L respectively. Enrollment CRP was elevated (215 mg\/L) in 29% of the patients, and hs-CRP was elevated (&gt; or = mg\/L) in 63% of the patients. Enrollment CRP was strongly correlated with hs-CRP (r = 0.7, p &lt; 0.0001). The presence of diabetes (22 mg\/L vs. 7.8 mg\/L, p = 0.02), infection and inflammatory conditions (44.9 mg\/L vs. 11.6 mg\/L, p = 0.001), and lower levels of markers of nutrition such as prealbumin (r = -0.47, p &lt; 0.0001) and creatinine (r = 0.35, p = 0.006) were associated with a higher level of CRP. Enrollment hs-CRP was a significant predictor of mortality in PD patients (relative risk = 1.044, p = 0.023). The observed cumulative survival (Kaplan-Meier) of patients with hs-CRP &lt;15 mg\/L was significantly better (p = 0.007) than was the survival of patients with a hs-CRP &gt; or =15 mg\/L. In a multivariate regression analysis, serum prealbumin was the best and only significant predictor of CRP level (beta = -0.37, p = 0.005). Elevated CRP was associated with infection and inflammation. Therefore, routine testing of hs-CRP in PD patients should be considered.","333":"Patients treated with renal replacement therapy (RRT) are considered to be at higher risk for infection with hepatitis B virus (HBV). Immunoprophylaxis is therefore deemed a standard of care. Active immunization in RRT patients leads to a lower incidence of protective titers of HBV antibodies (HBAbs) than the titers seen in healthy counterparts. Our hypothesis is that, for complex reasons, active immunization is more effective in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) than in patients on hemodialysis (HD), and that the effectiveness of immunization depends on dialysis adequacy (Kt\/V). We carried out a prospective multicenter study with an enrollment period that ran from January 1998 to December 2004. Follow-up data were analyzed as of August 2004. Inclusion criteria were an age of 18 years or older and newly indicated RRT Exclusion criteria were a history of HBV or the presence of either HBV antigen (HBAg) or HBAbs in the protective range. The choice of RRT modality (HD or PD) was based on patient preference (preceded by thorough counseling). Active immunization followed accepted guidelines for RRT patients and began after clinical and laboratory steady state had been achieved. The endpoints were the number of patients with a protective HBAb titer and the number with newly diagnosed hepatitis B. In PD patients, we calculated Kt\/V on regular basis. We enrolled 211 patients, 171 of whom chose HD treatment, and 40 of whom chose PD. Positive response to immunization (defined as a serum level of HBAbs above 10 mIU\/mL) was achieved in 58 HD patients (34%) and 21 PD patients (53%, p = 0.03). In subgroup of PD patients with a weekly Kt\/Vgreater than 1.7 (n=28), the response rate rose to 71%--as compared with just 8% in patients with a weekly Kt\/V below 1.7 (p = 0.0003). In the PD cohort as a whole, the level of HBAbs correlated with Kt\/V No new cases of hepatitis B or HBAg positivity occurred in either group. From the viewpoint of successful HBV immunoprophylaxis in RRT patients, PD is the better modality choice. In PD patients, the success rate of immunoprophylaxis depends on weekly Kt\/V, which we propose should be 1.7 or higher","334":"In a previous communication, we demonstrated that, in the prevention of exit-site infection (ESI) in children, the cleansing agent 50% Amuchina (electrolytic chloroxidizer. Amuchina SpA, Genoa, Italy) is more effective than 10% povidone iodine and as effective as 4% chlorhexidine, but with fewer adverse secondary effects. In the present study, we assessed, in an Argentine pediatric population, whether Amuchina 3% is as effective as Amuchina 50% in preventing ESI in children on chronic peritoneal dialysis. In an open-label, single-center prospective study, 27 children (mean age: 7.2 years; range: 1.7-17 years) used 3% Amuchina as a cleansing agent for the daily care of a healthy exit site. Of the 27 children, 14 were switched from 50% Amuchina to 3% Amuchina, and 13 were using the 3% Amuchina for the first time. The control group consisted of 18 patients who had previously used 50% Amuchina as a cleansing agent. We followed the recommendations of the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis with regard to exit-site care, which include keeping the cleansing agent out of the sinus and rinsing the exit site with sterile water. Amuchina was used from the first post-implantation care of the exit site. No adverse secondary effects were seen with the use of Amuchina at either concentration. Patients using 3% Amuchina presented an ESI rate similar to that of patients using Amuchina 50%. The cost of 3% Amuchina was significantly lower than that of the 50% concentration, and it was even lower than the cost for 10% povidone iodine or 4% chlorhexidine. Although more research trials are needed to assess the efficacy of 3% Amuchina, we conclude that 3% Amuchina is the best and most cost-effective cleansing agent for the daily care of a healthy exit site in children on chronic peritoneal dialysis.","335":"A hemodialysis patient with the use of only his left arm wanted to switch to peritoneal dialysis. The Stay. Safe continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) system (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) appeared to be a possible solution. The goal was to train the individual to perform CAPD independently. The Stay. Safe dialysis system was chosen because of its single connection. The device uses a technology that inserts a pin into the lumen of the patient's catheter extension set, sealing and protecting the catheter from contamination before it is disconnected from the disk. The system also has an organizer: it holds the control dial that guides the patient in a systematic and linear fashion through the treatment steps from drain to close, making the system easy to learn and use. The patient learned quickly and felt confident about the procedure. He was able to safely perform the treatment independently.","336":"Damage to large arteries is a major contributory factor to the high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality of patients with end-stage renal disease. Among the methods for assessment of arterial damage, measurements of pulse wave velocity (PWV) are considered to predict cardiovascular risk. In the present study, we compared changes in the PWV of patients on hemodialysis (HD) and on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Patients were eligible for entry into the study if they had been on HD or CAPD for at least 3 months, but for fewer than 5 months, and if they had had no clinical cardiovascular disease during the 6 months preceding study entry. We followed a total of 22 patients (average age: 57.9 +\/- 9.8 years) on HD and 22 patients (average age: 59.7 +\/- 11.4 years) on CAPD for 1 year. Baseline PWV was determined, and a second measurement was performed 1 year after the baseline PWV had been obtained. Systolic and diastolic blood pressures in the two groups were similar [144.8 +\/- 18.4 mmHg over 83.2 +\/- 8.7 mmHg (CAPD) vs. 147.4 +\/- 18.8 mmHg over 87 +\/- 12.3 mmHg (HD)]. In the patients on CAPD, urine volume was fairly constant at about 546.1 +\/- 365 mL daily; however, urine volume for most of the patients on HD was less than 100 mL daily. Although no significant difference was observed in baseline PWV [1726.2 +\/- 374 m\/s (CAPD) vs. 1774.2 +\/- 531.36 m\/s (HD)], a significant difference in PWV was seen between the two groups at 1 year [1631.9 +\/- 380.8 m\/s (CAPD) vs. 1853.2 +\/- 434.2 m\/s (HD), p &lt; 0.05]. With the exception of level of serum cholesterol [256 + 24 mg\/dL (CAPD) vs. 187 + 25 mg\/dL (HD), p &lt; 0.05], other laboratory data were not significantly different between the two groups. Despite higher serum cholesterol in the patients on CAPD, PWV was faster in the patients on HD. There may be less arterial damage in patients on CAPD than in patients on HD.","337":"The most serious problem in peritoneal dialysis (PD) is the risk of final complication by encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) because of peritoneal deterioration. Markers useful for the noninvasive evaluation ofperitoneal deterioration are therefore required. In this multicenter prospective study of stable PD patients, we compared the dialysate-to-plasma (D\/P) concentration ratios of albumin, immunoglobulin G, and c2-macroglobulin, and effluent levels of interleukin 6 (IL-6) and fibrinogen\/fibrin degradation products (FDPs) to clarify the relationship between inflammation, fibrinolysis markers, and permeability to large molecules. At the beginning of the present study, significantly positive correlations were noted between the IL-6 and FDP concentrations and the D\/P ratios of albumin and a2-macroglobulin. In addition, a significantly positive correlation was noted between the FDP and IL-6 concentrations. However, the D\/P ratio of creatinine obtained by peritoneal equilibration test did not positively correlate with those markers. Moreover, a significantly positive correlation was noted between changes in the effluent concentrations of FDPs and IL-6 and in permeability markers for large molecules. The effluent IL-6 and FDP concentrations reflect a chronic inflammatory state in the peritoneum, which is associated with increased permeability to large molecules. In individual PD patients, careful observation of the clinical course and evaluation of changes in such markers are expected to predict peritoneal deterioration and the development of EPS.","338":"Allergic dermatitis around the catheter exit site, caused by topical antiseptics such as povidone iodine and chlorhexidine gluconate, is an uncommon complication in patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD). As yet, published reports concerning this rare non catheter-related complication are few. The frequency of this type of dermatitis is not known, because reports of isolated cases constitute the only source of information. Here, we report our clinical experience with 2 patients (2.3%) among the 86 children with end-stage renal disease who underwent CPD treatment at our center during the period between November 1995 and December 2004. These 2 pediatric patients developed allergic contact dermatitis, with extensive patchy and linear erythema around the exit-site area because of administration of povidone iodine solution. The symptoms subsided within a week in both patients after daily topical application of normal saline solution was started. Allergic dermatitis caused by povidone iodine at the site of the catheter exit should be kept in mind as a complication in patients on CPD. Antiseptic solutions should be used cautiously in these patients.","339":"At the age of 69 years, a woman with recurrent gastrointestinal bleeding underwent investigation by gastroscopy and colonoscopy. Extensive telangiectatic changes were observed in the canalis and antrum of the ventricle and in the colon. In parallel, the woman suffered from nephrotic syndrome, hypertension, and progressive renal failure attributable to chronic glomerular changes with extensive interstitialfibrosis. The progressive renal failure and recurrent gastrointestinal bleeds made frequent transfusions and erythropoietin injections necessary. Because of those complications, and because CAPD avoids the intermittent overhydration of a therapy such as hemodialysis and the risk of using anticoagulants, it was decided to perform continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) when dialysis became necessary. After CAPD was started, the woman's bleeding episodes decreased within 1 week. After 70 months of CAPD, the woman is well, without gastrointestinal bleeding. No transfusions have been necessary since the start of CAPD. For the now 77-year-old woman, data are as follows: epoetin beta dose, 12,000 U\/week; body weight, 67 kg; hemoglobin, 130 g\/L. The woman has experienced 1 episode of peritonitis since starting dialysis (6 months before the time of writing), because of a malfunction of the peritoneal dialysis device. No intestinal perforations have occurred. It seems worthwhile to try CAPD for dialysis in patients with morbus Osler","340":"Congestive heart failure (CHF), mainly because of ischemic heart disease, is becoming a common medical problem. As CHF worsens and reaches New York Heart Association (NYHA) class IV, many patients can become refractory to medical therapy, especially those who are elderly or who have pre-existing non uremic chronic renal failure. For such patients, quality of life, morbidity, and mortality are expected to be bad. Our objective in the present study was to make a preliminary assessment of the usefulness of icodextrin administered in a single nocturnal peritoneal exchange to patients nonrespondent to the maximal conventional medical therapy. We studied two patients (aged 80 and 87 years), who were affected by severe dilatative cardiomyopathy and moderate-to-severe chronic renal failure. After at least 12 months of treatment, we observed a significant improvement in quality of life and a reduction in morbidity and hospitalization in both patients. Both patients also significantly increased their creatinine clearance. One patient maintained ejection fraction stability (22%--&gt;27%); the other experienced an increase in ejection fraction to 50%from 25%. These preliminary observations suggest that a single nocturnal exchange with icodextrin can be an effective treatment in patients affected by refractory CHF and moderate-to-severe chronic renal failure.","341":"Outcomes of patients with diabetes on peritoneal dialysis (PD) are strongly influenced by cardiovascular and other vascular complications, which are directly related to poor glycemic control. These patients are dialyzed with conventional glucose-containing PD solutions, and the glucose that diffuses into the patients' circulation leads to further risk of poor glycemic control, increasing the risk of vascular complications and death. The central objective for managing patients with diabetes undergoing PD treatment is to develop strategies that reduce complications and improve quality of life through proper glycogenic control and reduction of peripheral insulin resistance.","342":"The use of lactate-based peritoneal dialysis solutions (PDFs) requires hepatic metabolism to convert lactate to bicarbonate. Pure bicarbonate solutions are particularly useful in the setting of hepatic dysfunction and whenever a high risk of lactate accumulation in the blood exists. This article reviews the recent literature related to laboratory findings and clinical experiences with bicarbonate-containing PDFs. The data suggest that bicarbonate-based solutions are safe and well tolerated and that, among patients with severe metabolic acidosis, they provide better correction of that acidosis than do lactate-containing PDFs. In addition, use of bicarbonate solution seems to be associated with improved nutrition, better growth rate in children with end-stage renal disease, better preservation of residual renal function, and, possibly, higher peritoneal ultrafiltration and a lower peritonitis rate. More experience with these solutions and more prospective controlled studies should be encouraged to further characterize the potential benefits of bicarbonate solutions.","343":"Technologic advances in peritoneal dialysis (PD) have a significant impact on patient care. Here, we review recent technology with special emphasis on connectology, equipment, PD solutions, new modalities, patient management programs, and pharmaceuticals proposed for membrane preservation. Some of these advances and practices are in their early experimental stages (for example, continuous-flow PD) and others are limited to a few geographic areas (for example, biocompatible PD solutions). Thus, the impact on PD growth and patient care varies from country to country.","344":"Although direct evidence is unavailable, indirect evidence strongly suggests that the risk of extracellular (EC) volume expansion increases with long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD). Long-term PD patients routinely develop loss of residual renal function (RRF) and often develop increased rates of peritoneal solute transport. Loss of RRF is associated with hypervolemia and increased risk of death. It is also indirectly linked both to development of high peritoneal transport (through the prescription of larger hypertonic dextrose loads) and to further limitations of peritoneal sodium removal [through automated PD (APD), which is often prescribed as a means of increasing peritoneal clearances as renal clearances decrease, and which causes, through its shortened dwell periods, low rates of peritoneal sodium removal]. High peritoneal solute transport limits peritoneal ultrafiltration and sodium removal; it is a recognized risk factor for hypervolemia. Many cross-sectional studies measuring EC volume have documented moderate to severe hypervolemia in large numbers of PD patients. In long-term PD, hypervolemia has severe consequences including morbidity and mortality. Preventing hypervolemia in PD patients requires a focus on maintaining sodium balance. The means include lowering the dialysate sodium concentration for APD exchanges, using icodextrin, and, primarily, reducing dietary sodium intake to a level determined by monitoring the patient's sodium removal rate in urine plus dialysate. Periodic measurements of sodium removal rates and appropriate adjustments of dietary sodium intake should be considered measures of adequacy in PD.","345":"We analyzed abnormalities in serum potassium ([K]) in 40 episodes of diabetic ketoacidosis (DKA)--6 episodes in peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 34 episodes in hemodialysis (HD)--and in 245 episodes of nonketotic hyperglycemia (NKH)--70 episodes in PD and 175 episodes in HD. Serum glucose ([Glu]) was 25 mmol\/L or higher in all episodes. We compared the PD and HD hyperglycemic episodes separately for DKA and NKH. For DKA, [Glu] was 55.5 + 4.8 mmol\/L in PD and 51.9 +\/- 12.2 mmol\/L in HD [p = nonsignificant (NS)], and [K] was 6.4 +\/- 1.5 mmol\/L in PD and 6.3 +\/- 1.1 mmol\/L in HD (p=NS). Also for DKA, [K] was 5.5 mmol\/L or higher in 4 episodes (66.7%) in PD and in 26 episodes (76.5%) in HD (p=NS), and 6.0 mmol\/L or higher in 3 episodes (50.0%) in PD and in 22 (episodes 64.7%) in HD (p=NS). For NKH, [Glu] was 39.4 +\/- 14.7 mmol\/L in PD and 37.8 +\/- 12.4 mmol\/L in HD (p=NS), and [K] was 4.3 +\/- 0.9 mmol\/L in PD and 5.1 +\/- 0.8 mmol\/L in HD (p &lt; 0.001). Also for NKH, [K] was 5.5 mmol\/L or higher in 7 episodes (10.0%) in PD and in 55 episodes (31.4%) in HD (p &lt; 0.001), and 6.0 mmol\/L or higher in 4 episodes (5.7%) in PD and in 31 episodes (17.7%) in HD (p = 0.023). Serum sodium, tonicity, urea, osmolality, creatinine, chloride and anion gap, and arterial blood pH and partial pressure of carbon dioxide did not differ between PD and HDfor either DKA or NKH episodes, but serum total carbon dioxide content was lower in PD than in HD DKA episodes (6.5 + 3.8 mmol\/L vs. 9.5 + 2.8 mmol\/L, p = 0.038), and higher in PD than in HD NKH episodes (22.5 + 6.0 mmol\/L vs. 20.9 + 4.4 mmol\/L, p = 0.004). Although PD and HD DKA episodes appear not to differ in [K], the mean [K] and the frequency of hyperkalemia are both lower in PD than in HD NKH episodes. Differences between PD and HD in acid-base balance and, probably, in other factors affecting [K] (such as mineralocorticoid metabolism and blood levels) may account for the differences in [K] between PD and HD NKH episodes.","346":"Peritoneal catheter removal may be clinically indicated in the management of peritonitis. The data on the course of patients undergoing peritoneal catheter reinsertion after removal for peritonitis are limited. The present study was designed to examine what happens to patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) after peritoneal catheter removal for peritonitis. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of patients who developed peritonitis between January 1, 1990, and September 1, 2002. We identified 1146 episodes of peritonitis; in 189 of the episodes (16%), the peritoneal catheter was removed. Catheters were reinserted in 88 of those patients (47%). Reasons for peritoneal catheter removal among the 88 patients who underwent peritoneal catheter reinsertion included unit protocol (51%), poor response to antibiotics (46%), and exit-site or tunnel infection (3%). Reasons for peritoneal catheter removal among the 101 patients in whom the peritoneal catheter was not reinserted included unit protocol (62%), poor response to antibiotics (20%), and extensive history of peritonitis (18%). After reinsertion, the new peritoneal catheter remained in place for a mean of 15.4 +\/- 15.4 months (range: 1-75 months). In 37 of the 88 patients with reinserted peritoneal catheters (42%), the catheters remained in place for longer than 1 year. The remaining 6 patients underwent transplantation or were transferred to another facility. Of the remaining 51 patients whose new peritoneal catheters lastedfor less than I year, 13 (25.5%) died, and 32 (63%) were transferred permanently to hemodialysis. Of the 101 patients who did not have a peritoneal catheter reinserted, 23 (23%) died within the 2-week period following the onset of peritonitis. The rest were transferred to hemodialysis. The reasons noted for not reinserting the peritoneal catheter included frequent episodes of peritonitis, patient unwillingness to retry CPD therapy, psychosocial reasons, bowel perforation, or transfer to an institution unable to perform CPD therapy. We conclude that, among patients who medically require peritoneal catheter removal because of peritonitis, few will successfully return to long-term CPD therapy. Of the patients who required peritoneal catheter removal in our study, 23% died within the first 2 weeks after the onset of peritonitis, before catheter reinsertion could be considered. Only 47% of the patients underwent a successful catheter reinsertion; and, of those, only 34% remained on CPD therapy I year later Thus, only 20% of patients undergoing PD catheter removal remain on CPD therapy 1 year after catheter removal.","347":"Dialysis adequacy indices that may be used to evaluate the efficiency of small-solute removal include Kt\/V, fractional solute removal (FSR), and equivalent urea clearance (EKR). To analyze possible relationships between those indices, we used the two-compartment variable-volume urea kinetic model to simulate several dialysis modalities: hemodialysis (HD) performed three times or six times weekly, automatic nightly peritoneal dialysis (PD), and continuous ambulatory PD. Instead of targeting a chosen Kt\/V value, we selected a weekly FSR of 1.81 as the target adequacy index. We determined hemodialyzer clearances and diffusive mass transport parameters for the peritoneal membrane that yielded the desired value of FSR for a typical patient and dialysis schedule. By theoretic analysis, EKR and FSR are proportional: EKR\/FSR = V\/Tc, where V = urea distribution volume in the body and Tc = time of the dialysis cycle, usually 1 week. Thus, FSR and EKR have the same meaning and scaling in PD and HD, and may be equivalently applied for assessment of dialysis efficacy.","348":"In this retrospective study, we evaluated the impact of automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) on initial graft function after cadaveric renal transplantation. Each patient on APD was matched for donor age, donor serum creatinine, and cold ischemia time with one control patient on HD. The study sample consisted of 67 cases and 67 controls. The rate of delayed graft function--defined as a need for dialysis within the first week following renal transplantation-was 16% in the APD group and 10% in the HD group [p = nonsignificant (NS)]. The proportion of patients with a creatinine clearance below 10 mL\/min 6 days after renal transplantation was 7% in the APD group and 3% in the HD group. Of the 67 APD patients, 12 had slow graft function as compared with 13 of the 67 HD patients (p=NS). Weight changes 3 days after transplantation were +2.1% +\/- 3.7% of dry weight in HD patients and -0.1% +\/- 4.6% of dry weight in APD patients (p &lt; 0.05). The total amount of fluid infused during the surgical procedure was similar in the two groups (55.8 +\/- 14.3 mL\/kg vs. 60.7 +\/- 14.8 mL\/kg). Compared with HD, APD was not associated with a lower rate of delayed graft function.","349":"In the present study, we analyzed the short-term outcome of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) in a group of elderly Bangladeshi patients with diabetes. Over a period of 2 years, we tracked various parameters in 60 patients on maintenance dialysis (25 on PD, 35 on HD). Mean age of the patients was 62 +\/- 12 years (PD) and 57 +\/- 8 years (HD), p &lt; 0.03. Pre-dialysis systolic blood pressures (SBP) were 156 +\/- 12 mmHg and 160 +\/- 15 mmHg, and diastolic blood pressures (DBP) were 86 +\/- 7 mmHg and 84 +\/- 6 mmHg, both p = nonsignificant (NS). Pre-dialysis serum creatinine (SCr) levels were 1036 +\/- 139 micromol\/L and 1028 +\/- 408 micromol\/L, and daily urine volumes (UV) were 1.1 -\/+ 0.4 L and 1 +\/- 0.1 L, both also p=NS. At the end of the 2 years, durations of dialysis were 14 +\/- 8 months (PD) and 13 +\/- 12 months (HD), p=NS; SBPs were 142 +\/- 15 mmHg and 155 +\/- 18 mmHg, p &lt; 0.004; DBPs were 81 +\/- 6 mmHg and 80 +\/- 7 mmHg, p=NS; and SCr levels were 538 +\/- 154 micromol\/L and 578 +\/- 195 micormol\/L, p=NS. The daily UVs had declined to 0.7 +\/- 0.3 L and 0.3 +\/- 0.3 L (p &lt; 0.001) after periods of 12 +\/- 7 months and 7 +\/- 5 months (p &lt; 0.001) respectively. During the study period, mortality in the PD group was 60% and in the HD group was 43% (p=NS). We conclude that elderly diabetic patients on PD have better control of blood pressure and maintain residual renal function longer than do similar patients on HD; at the same time, mortality in the two groups is comparable.","350":"In the present study, we used high sensitivity C-reactive protein (hs-CRP) analysis in combination with lipid screening [which has been reported to be a more valuable risk marker than other novel markers such as homocysteine (Hcy) and lipoprotein a] to perform cardiovascular risk assessment in peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients. We selected 9 PD patients, 10 HD patients, and 9 control subjects for the study. In those patients, we determined levels of serum lipids, hs-CRP, Hcy, vitamin B12, folic acid, and leptin. Patients on PD had a significantly elevated hs-CRP concentration (3.14 +\/- 0.79 mg\/L) and ratio of total cholesterol (TC) to high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (4.71 +\/- 0.40), and their cardiovascular risk was found to be three times that of control subjects. In HD patients, the elevation of hs-CRP was more profound (5.66 +\/- 1.30), but their TC:HDL ratio fell within the normal range (3.18 +\/- 0.13). However, a cardiovascular risk assessment of the HD group showed the same risk as in the PD group. Serum Hcy was also elevated in patients on PD (54.95 +\/- 18.08 microl\/L) and on HD (25.33 +\/- 3.70 micromol\/L) as compared with healthy subjects (13.76 +\/- 0.94 micromol\/L). Folic acid and vitamin B12 levels (needed to remethylate Hcy to methionine) were not compromised in the dialysis population. On the other hand, leptin secreted by adipose tissue was found to be mildly higher in PD patients (37.08 +\/- 12.59 ng\/mL). The mean leptin level in control subjects was 14.14 +\/- 3.60 ng\/mL. The proinflammatory and proangiogenic action of excess leptin may aggravate cardiovascular risk in PD patients. Increased values of known risk factors were found in dialysis patients on PD and on HD. However, lower levels of HDL cholesterol, higher cardiovascular risk assessment and Hcy levels, and mildly increased leptin levels seem to increase the potential threat of vascular disease in PD patients more than in HD patients.","351":"Compliance with the prescribed exchanges in peritoneal dialysis (PD) is important to dialysis success. In the present study, we used measurement of supply inventories to determine compliance by PD patients with the prescribed bag exchanges. We performed home supply inventories by telephone with 30 stable PD patients. Patients who performed at least 90% of prescribed exchanges were considered compliant. Mean age of the patients was 52.8 years. Seven of the patients (23%) had diabetes, and 19 (63%) were women. Peritoneal dialysis was the first choice of renal replacement therapy in 19 patients (63%); the other 11 (37%) had been allocated to PD. Of the 30 patients, 21 (70%) were compliant, and 9 (30%) were not. Among patients choosing PD, 74% were compliant; among those allocated to PD, compliance was found to be 64%. Furthermore, of the compliant patients, 67% had opted for PD and only 33% had been allocated to PD. In the noncompliant group, 56% had opted for and 44% had been allocated to PD. Weekly Kt\/V was 1.9 for compliant patients and 1.53 for noncompliant patients. The peritonitis rates in the two groups were similar (0.5 episodes per patient-year for compliant patients and 0.4 episodes per year-patient for noncompliant patients). Participation in the decision-making process improves compliance. Telephone calls about supply inventories is a simple method of monitoring compliance. Developing interventions to enhance compliance in PD patients is a challenge to nurses and to the renal team.","352":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD)-associated peritonitis contributes significantly to morbidity and modalityfailure. The number of patients on PD is declining in Western countries, and peritonitis is a potential deterrent to the therapy. Here, we present a clinically significant decline in the rate of peritonitis at a single center over a 28-year period, with current rates significantly lower than the national average, and we review several factors that have contributed to those outcomes. Peritonitis and duration of follow-up have been recorded for all patients followed in our program since 1977. Introduction of important technological changes into the program were also recorded. All peritonitis rates are expressed as episodes\/patient-year or episodes\/n patient-months. Data are summarized for each calendar year since 1977. We followed 682 patients for a total follow-up duration of 15,435 patient-months. Glass bottles were changed to plastic bags in 1978. Straight connecting tubes were replaced by Y-sets in 1988. The presternal dialysis catheter was introduced in 1991 and has been the primary PD access since 1995. The peritonitis rate in 1977 was 5.8 episodes\/patient-year, and that rate has progressively declined over the past 27 years to 0.35 episodes\/patient-year in 2004. Technical improvements that contributed to the decline in overall peritonitis rates have been adopted nationwide. The largest improvement occurred with the switch from glass bottles to plastic bags, and to the closed-system Y-set that incorporated the flush-before-fill principle. Advances in catheter technology have also played a key role. Quality improvement in the program and long years of experience in overall care of PD patients are significant factors that cannot be measured quantitatively. Improvements have been made to exit-site care protocols, to exit-site evaluation and diagnosis, and to treatment strategies. Patient education and training in catheter care remain the important factor in a PD program. Many factors have contributed to the reduction of PD-associated peritonitis rates at our center Improved connectology, catheter care, and patient education play key roles in the reduction of peritonitis.","353":"Rapid diagnosis of peritonitis remains a significant goal in the management of patients who are maintained on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Several attempts to use leukocyte esterase reagent strips to diagnose peritonitis have been described. In the present study, we evaluated the usefulness of a new reagent strip, the PeriScreen Test Strip (Serim Research, Elkhart, IN, U.S.A.), for diagnosis of peritonitis in PD patients. This reagent strip for leukocyte esterase was designed to test PD fluid. It has 4 colorimetric grades (negative, trace, small, and large). We used the strips to evaluate PD fluid in 54 PD patients. In those patients, we diagnosed 19 episodes of peritonitis as defined by the criteria set out by the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis. The test strips showed a sensitivity of 100%, a specificity of 97%, a positive predictive value of 95%, and a negative predictive value of 100%. PeriScreen Test Strip reagent strips have excellent utility as a simple, rapid bedside screening test to exclude peritonitis in PD patients.","354":"Nocardiosis is an opportunistic infection especially in patients with underlying chronic debilitating disease or immunodeficiency. Nocardia peritonitis is an uncommon infection in peritoneal dialysis patients. Here, we report a case of peritonitis by Nocardia asteroides during automated peritoneal dialysis in a 35-year-old male patient who had prolonged immunosuppressive therapy to treat acute rejection of a nonfunctioning kidney allograft. The patient presented at our outpatient clinic with typical symptoms of acute peritonitis. The peritoneal fluid leukocyte count was 20,500 cells\/microL, with 90% neutrophils. Gram staining showed gram-positive filamentous bacilli later identified as N. asteroides. After bacterial identification, the patient received trimethoprim 320 mg and sulfamethoxazole 3200 mg intravenously every 48 hours (TMP-SMX), plus amikacin 100 mg intraperitoneally daily. The immunosuppressive therapy was reduced. Peritoneal fluid cultures became negative after 1 week of treatment, concomitant with clinical improvement. Unfortunately, after 5 weeks of therapy, the patient developed hematologic side effects attributable to the TMP-SMX treatment. The TMP-SMX was suspended at that time, and the patient then received cefuroxime 500 mg by mouth and amikacin 100 mg intraperitoneally daily for a total of 12 weeks. The patient recovered completely and was discharged 3 months after onset of the peritonitis. Prolonged antibiotic therapy without catheter removal has not been previously described in immunosuppressed patients with APD peritonitis. The combination of amikacin and TMP-SMX may be safe and effective in APD patients who develop N. asteroides peritonitis.","355":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia is increasingly being recognized as an important cause of nosocomial infection. S. maltophilia peritonitis is a rare complication of chronic peritoneal dialysis. Here, we report the case of a 54-year-old female with end-stage renal disease treated with automated peritoneal dialysis. The patient had no previous history of peritonitis or catheter exit-site infection. She presented with fever, abdominal pain, and cloudy peritoneal effluent. The organism isolated from the effluent was S. maltophilia. The patient received trimethoprim 320 mg and sulfamethoxazole 1600 mg for 6 weeks, plus amikacin 200 mg for 14 days. She recovered completely, with no need for catheter removal. No recurrence was observed.","356":"Transient bacteremia during and after endoscopic procedures is a well-documented phenomenon. Streptococcus viridans peritonitis is frequently associated with peritoneal dialysis, and the infection is probably attributable to hematogenous spread, dental procedures, or transluminal contamination with oral flora. To our knowledge, no reports exist of peritonitis occurring after gastroscopy in peritoneal dialysis patients. Here, we report the case of a 69-year-old male patient receiving automated peritoneal dialysis who required emergency gastroscopy and sclerotherapy plus heat-probe coagulation to control active bleeding from a duodenal ulcer The next day, this patient developed nausea and abdominal pain. The diagnosis of peritonitis was made based on a cloudy peritoneal effluent and a leukocyte count of 11,500 cells\/microL with 98% neutrophils. S. viridans was identified in the peritoneal fluid culture. The patient received ceftazidime for 14 days, followed by clarithromycin for 7 days, and he recovered successfully. Patients receiving peritoneal dialysis who undergo esophagogastroduodenal endoscopy are at risk to develop peritonitis, and so antibiotic prophylaxis is desirable.","357":"We performed in vitro experiments with the isolated rabbit parietal peritoneum to evaluate the importance of fluid stirring intensification and of chemical modification of mesothelium and interstitium to the peritoneal transport of glucose and icodextrin. We used a mathematical model of mass transport to calculate the diffusive permeability coefficient, P, in centimeters per second. In control conditions (intact tissue; stirring rate: 11 mL\/min), the rate of glucose (2.0 g\/dL) transfer remained constant, and no differences were observed for transport from the interstitial to the mesothelial (I--&gt;M) side of the membrane or in the opposite direction (M--&gt;I). The value of P (+\/- standard error of the mean) was 2.731 +\/- 0.472 x 10(-4) cm\/s. In contrast, the icodextrin (7.5 g\/dL) I--&gt;M transport rate was higher than that for M--&gt;I (P: 0.319 +\/- 0.038 x 10(-4) cm\/s and 0.194 +\/- 0.035 x 10(-4) cm\/s respectively). Dynamics of the icodextrin M--&gt;I transfer were constant, but I--&gt;M increased by 50% over time. The intensification of the stirring rate increased the value of P at varying rates: the increase was greater for icodextrin than for glucose, and greater for the I--&gt;M transport direction than for the M--&gt;I direction for both solutes. Chemical modification (by 2.5 mmol\/L sodium deoxycholate) increased glucose and icodextrin I--&gt;M transfer a mean of 41% and 81% respectively, but increased M--&gt;I transfer by 70% and 224% respectively. The dynamics of glucose and icodextrin peritoneal transfer in vitro are different: glucose diffusion is constant, but I--&gt;M icodextrin transfer increases over time and is greater than M--&gt;I transfer Fluid stirring intensification and chemical injury to the peritoneum enhance diffusion of glucose and icodextrin. Glucose and icodextrin M--&gt;I transfer but not I--&gt;M transfer is restricted more by tissue barriers than by stagnant fluid layers.","358":"We investigated the effect of transforming growthfactor beta (TGFbeta1) short hairpin RNA (shRNA) mediated by pcDU6 plasmid on TGFbeta1 expression in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) and compared that effect with the effect of antisense TGFbeta1 RNA. We designed two pairs of oligonucleotides for two selectedfragments of coding sequence containing a 21-nucleotide (nt) TGFbeta1 sequence starting with GGCC. After annealing, double-stranded DNA was formed and separately ligated to plasmid pcDU6 [pcDNA3.1(-) with U6 promoter). The inverted motif contained six spacers and four Ts, which made it possible to form shRNA (TGFbgeta1 shRNA1 and TGFbeta1 shRNA2). We generated recombinant human TGFbeta1 antisense mammalian expression vector, and we isolated HPMCs from human greater omentum by pancreatin disaggregation to establish a stable cell-culture model. We used Lipofectamine 2000 to transfect third-passage HPMCs with plasmid pcDU6 mediating the expression of TGFbeta1 and plasmid pcDNA3.1(-) mediating the expression of antisense TGFbeta1 messenger RNA (mRNA). The resulting transfected cells were then stimulated with 4.25% D-glucose and 10 microg\/mL lipopolysaccharide (GS+LPS). We used semi-quantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction to detect the expression of TGFbeta1, fibronectin (FN), collagen 1, and plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1 (PAI-1) mRNA by the stimulated cells. The TGFbeta1, FN, and PAI-1 protein levels in the culture supernatant were measured with a sandwich enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Expression of TGFbeta1 was significantly upregulated in HPMCs stimulated with GS+LPS (p &lt; 0.01). As compared with control HPMCs in serum-free F12 medium, HPMCs transfected with TGFbeta1 antisense RNA showed inhibited expression of FN, collagen 1, and PAI-1 mRNA (17%, 26%, and 9.6% respectively after 24 hours). Forty-eight hours after transfection, the FN and PAI-I proteins were inhibited by 54.55% and 61.13% respectively (p &lt; 0.05). In the pcDU6 plasmid vector-mediated TGFbeta1 shRNA groups, TGFbeta1 expression was obviously downregulated as compared with the GS+LPS group and the pcDU6 void vector group (p &lt; 0.01). No significant difference was observed between the pcDU6 plasmid vector-mediated TGFbeta1 shRNA groups (p &gt; 0.05). No significant difference was observed between the pcDNA3.1(-) vector-mediated antisense RNA group and the pcDU6 void vector group (p &gt; 0.05). The expression of TGFbeta1 in pcDU6 plasmid vector-mediated TGFbeta1 shRNA groups was obviously downregulated as compared with the pcDNA3.1(-) plasmid vector-mediated antisense RNA group (p &lt; 0.01). In HPMCs stimulated with GS+LPS, pcDU6 plasmid vector-mediated shRNA can significantly inhibit the induced expression of TGFbeta1. These results suggest the possible application of pcDU6 plasmid vector-mediated shRNA in preventing peritoneal fibrosis in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis.","359":"Dietary deficiency causes abnormalities in circulating lymphocyte counts. For the present paper, we evaluated correlations between total and subpopulation lymphocyte counts (TLC, SLCs) and parameters of nutrition in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Studies were carried out in 55 patients treated with PD for 22.2 +\/- 11.4 months. Parameters of nutritional status included total body mass, lean body mass (LBM), body mass index (BMI), and laboratory indices [total protein, albumin, iron, ferritin, and total iron binding capacity (TIBC)]. The SLCs were evaluated using flow cytometry. Positive correlations were seen between TLC and dietary intake of niacin; TLC and CD8 and CD16+56 counts and energy delivered from protein; CD4 count and beta-carotene and monounsaturated fatty acids 17:1 intake; and CD19 count and potassium, copper, vitamin A, and beta-carotene intake. Anorexia negatively influenced CD19 count. Serum albumin showed correlations with CD4 and CD19 counts, and LBM with CD19 count. A higher CD19 count was connected with a higher red blood cell count, hemoglobin, and hematocrit. Correlations were observed between TIBC and TLC and CD3 and CD8 counts, and between serum Fe and TLC and CD3 and CD4 counts. Patients with a higher CD19 count showed a better clinical-laboratory score, especially less weakness. Patients with a higher CD4 count had less expressed insomnia. Quantities of ingested vitamins and minerals influence lymphocyte counts in the peripheral blood of PD patients. Evaluation of TLC and SLCs is helpful in monitoring the effectiveness of nutrition in these patients.","360":"Metabolic acidosis negatively influences dietary intake, increases protein catabolism, and deteriorates nutritional status. In the present study, we evaluated in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients whether parameters of blood acid-base equilibrium influence total and subpopulation lymphocyte counts (TLC, SLCs), which are markers of the immunologic and nutritional status of dialyzed patients. Studies were carried out in 55 patients, mean age 50.9 +\/- 12.4 years, treated with PD for a mean of 22.2 +\/- 11.4 months. Parameters of blood acid-base equilibrium were measured simultaneously with evaluation of TLC and SLCs. (Antigens CD3, CD4, CD5, CD8, CD19, CD16+56 were determined using flow cytometry.) The study patients showed compensated metabolic acidosis (pH: 7.40 +\/- 0.04; HCO3-: 22.9 +\/- 2.4 mmol\/L). Statistical analysis revealed significant (p &lt; 0.05) positive correlations of bicarbonate blood concentration and base excess with TLC and with CD3, CD5, and CD8 cell counts, but not with CD19 and CD16+56 cell counts. The CD4 cell count correlated only with blood bicarbonate level. Patients on PD who show better correction of metabolic acidosis also show higher TLC and CD3, CD4, CD5, and CD8 cell counts. The numbers of B lymphocytes (CD19) and natural killer cells (CD16+56) are not directly related to bicarbonate blood concentration, at least in the examined range.","361":"Instead of the peritoneal equilibration test (PET), the dialysis adequacy and transport test (DATT) is an easy and convenient method to classify peritoneal transport type. However, the peritoneal transport characteristics obtained from the DATT and the PET are not same in some cases. In the present study, we investigated the ability of the DATT to identify peritoneal transport characteristics in a clinical setting, and we analyzed the characteristics of patients with a discrepancy between the DATT and the PET. We studied 106 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) who underwent 198 simultaneous DATTs and PETs. The 24-hour dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creatinine (D \/ P(Cr)) from each DATT was compared with the adjusted 4-hour D\/P(Cr) from the corresponding PET. Based on the degree of the mean discrepancy between the 24-hour D \/ P(Cr) and the adjusted 4-hour D \/ P(Cr) the patients were divided into three groups: Group A patents had 24-hour D \/ P(Cr) values that were lower than the adjusted 4-hour D \/ P(Cr) values (n=13). Group B patients had 24-hour D \/ P(Cr) values that were equivalent to the adjusted 4-hour D \/ P(Cr) values (n=156). Group C patients had 24-hour D \/ P(Cr) values that were higher than the adjusted 4-hour D \/ P(Cr) values (n=29). The comparative analysis among the three groups was adjustedforperitoneal transport characteristics, dialysis adequacy indices, nutrition status, and daily dialysis prescription. The 24-hour D \/ P(Cr) from the DATT correlated significantly with the 4-hour D \/ P(Cr) (gamma = 0.759, p &lt; 0.0001). In 156 cases (78.8%), the D \/ P(Cr) values from the DATT and the PET showed reasonable agreement; but, in 42 cases (21.2%), the values were discordant. In 94 cases (47.5%), the peritoneal transport groups as classified by the DATT and the PET were discordant. The mean difference in D \/ P(Cr) between the DATT and the PET was 0.07 +\/- 0.08, and the DATT differed significantly from the PET in categorizing the low and low-average transport groups (p &lt; 0.05). A significant difference was seen between the three groups in daily exchange volume (group A: 7384.6 +\/- 1502.2 mL; group B: 7537.3 +\/- 1087.7 mL; group C: 6675.9 +\/- 1414.6 mL; p &lt; 0.05) and in the frequency of daily exchanges (group A: 3.7 +\/- 0.8 exchanges; group B: 3.8 +\/- 0.4 exchanges; group C: 3.4 +\/- 0.7 exchanges; p &lt; 0.05). We confirmed that the DATT is an easy and convenient method of identifying peritoneal membrane transport instead of the PET, and that the DATT can be generalized to patients receiving various dialysis prescriptions and to patients receiving four daily exchanges. However, the DATT may be less accurate for CAPD patients with low or low-average transport, and the higher value of D \/ P(Cr) derived from the DATT, as compared with the PET, is attributable to longer dwell times and a lower dwell volume.","362":"Using changes in cell counts and levels of cancer antigen 125 (CA125), fibrinogen degradation product (FDP), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) in effluent before and after the use of icodextrin-based peritoneal dialysis solution (icodextrin), we evaluated the effects of icodextrin on peritoneal membrane. The subjects were 8 anuric patients (4 men, 4 women) who had been using a 2.5% glucose-based dialysis solution (glucose solution) for the overnight dwell. The mean age of the patients was 57.9 +\/- 6.1 years, and their mean duration of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis was 61.6 +\/- 44.3 months. In all patients, chronic glomerulonephritis was the cause of end-stage renal disease. We changed the 2.5% glucose solution used for the 8-hour dwell to an icodextrin, and we compared cell counts in effluent and levels of IL-6, FDP, and CA125 in the overnight effluent before, and 12 and 36 weeks after, the switch to the icodextrin. When 2.5% glucose solution was used for the overnight 8-hour dwell, the mean cell count in the effluent was 5.5 +\/- 3 cells\/mm3. However, 12 and 36 weeks after the start of icodextrin, mean cell counts in effluent were significantly increased to 15.3 +\/- 7.7 cells\/mm3 (p &lt; 0.01) and 16.5 +\/- 11.2 cells\/mm3 (p &lt; 0.01) respectively. Values of effluent CA125, FDP, and IL-6 obtained during the use of a glucose solution were compared to values obtained 12 and 36 weeks after the start of icodextrin. Effluent levels of CA125 and IL-6 did not vary before and after the use of the icodextrin, but levels of FDP in the icodextrin effluent were higher than the levels found in the effluent of a 2.5% glucose solution (7278.8 +\/- 2915 ng\/mL before the start of icodextrin; 29,875 +\/- 13,227 ng\/mL 12 weeks after icodextrin introduction, p &lt; 0.01; and 12,062.9 +\/- 5684.6 ng\/mL 36 weeks after icodextrin introduction). Icodextrin induced a subclinical inflammatory response in the peritoneum. Therefore, biocompatibility of an icodextrin solution is not always superior to that of a glucose solution, and further research is needed to clarify the influence of long-term icodextrin use on the peritoneum.","363":"To be optimal, a peritoneal dialysis prescription should consider the peritoneal surface area recruitment. In fact, as shown by computed tomography imaging, only a fraction of the available anatomic peritoneum is in contact with the dialysate (PDF). Various factors may dynamically affect the recruitment of the wetted membrane: posture, fill volume, PDF composition (biocompatibility), and pharmacologic agents (phospholipids). To precisely determine the peritoneal membrane recruitment capacity, we developed an animal model. In 5\/6 bi-nephrectomized rats on peritoneal dialysis, between week 6 and week 8 post surgery, we used MRI to assess the contact area, with the dialysate acting as the contrast medium (fill volume: 10 mL per 100-g rat body weight). The MRI protocol consisted of axially oriented, turbo spin-echo, 3-mm slice, T2 weighted sequences. The contact area was measured using an adapted three-dimensional MRI reconstruction software based on DICOM (digital imaging and communications in medicine) images. The MRI studies (n=10) were successful. They showed that only a fraction of the presumed anatomic area (30% - 40%) was in contact with the PDF Peritoneal MRI in rats is a method that shows potential for assessing peritoneal contact area and its variation under experimental conditions.","364":"To test the precision of estimates of body water and urea clearance in peritoneal dialysis (PD), we compared, in 925 PD patients who underwent formal urea kinetics studies, estimates of V and Kt\/V urea obtained by the use of the Watson, Hume, and Sahlgrenska anthropometric formulas and two novel formulas, one (Vcreat) computed using fat-free mass (FFM) estimated from creatinine kinetics as 0.73 x FFMcreat, and the other (VBMI) calculated as 0.73 x FFM(BMI) where FFM(BMI) was obtained by the Gallagher formula, which estimates body composition as a function of body mass index (BMI). Comparisons by twos were performed using the paired t-test and the Wilcoxon sign rank test with the Bonferroni correction for multiple (n=10) comparisons. The results for V (liters) were Watson, 36.7 +\/- 7.1; Hume, 37.3 +\/- 7.3; Sahlgrenska, 36.8 +\/- 7.6; Vcreat, 32.2 +\/- 9.8; and VBMP 37.2 +\/- 7.8. With the exception of V(BMI) and V(Hume) which did not differ, all other values differed (p &lt; 0.001) from one another regardless of whether a parametric or nonparametric comparison was performed. The results for weekly total Kt\/V urea were Watson, 2.05 +\/- 0.57; Hume, 2.03 +\/- 0.57; Sahlgrenska, 2.06 +\/- 0.59; from Vcreat 2.42 +\/- 0.71; and from V(BMP) 2.03 +\/- 0.58. All of those values differed from one another (p &lt; 0.001) by both methods of comparison. Using cut-off values (1.50, 1.75, and 2.00) as indices of adequate total weekly Kt\/V urea, the discrepancies between any two estimates by the five studied formulas varied in the range 1.1% - 34.2%. Despite numerically close mean values, estimates of V based on various anthropometric formulas differ substantially and cause substantial discrepancies in the classification of Kt\/V urea as inadequate or adequate. This lack of precision, added to the known lack of accuracy of the estimates, confounds the interpretation of the clinical relevance of urea kinetic estimates in PD.","365":"To investigate how water flow and interstitial pressure change in tissue during a peritoneal dwell with isotonic fluid, we developed a mathematical model of water transport in the tissue. Transport through muscle alone (M) and through muscle with intact skin (MS) were considered for the rat abdominal wall, using various parameters for muscle and skin. Based on the concept of distributed capillary and lymphatic systems, two main transport barriers were taken into account. capillary membrane and interstitium. We calculated the tissue hydrostatic pressure profiles and compared them with experimental data. The theoretic steady-state pressure distribution for model M is in good agreement with the experimental data. In model MS, the theoretic distribution diverges from the data in the subcutaneous layer. The transient times for fluid flow in the tissue for both model simulations are rather long (40 minutes in model M and 95 minutes in model MS) and depend on intraperitoneal pressure. The fraction of fluid absorbed from the tissue by the lymphatics increases with time from 10% to 97% of fluid flow from the peritoneal cavity.","366":"The peritoneal mesothelium is a barrier to ion transport in peritoneal dialysis. In the present study, we used Ussing chamber experiments to investigate the effect of amiloride on the transmesothelial electrical resistance (R(TM)) of isolated visceral sheep peritoneum. Peritoneal samples from the omentum of adult sheep were isolated directly after the death of the animals and were transferred to the laboratory within 30 minutes in a cooled Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (4 degrees C, pH 7.5) bubbled with 95% O2\/5% CO2. A visceral peritoneal planar sheet was mounted in an Ussing-type chamber and amiloride (10(-3) mol\/L) was added apically and basolaterally. The R(TM) was measured before and serially for 30 minutes after the addition of amiloride. Because active ion transport is temperature dependent, the Ussing chambers were held at 37 degrees C. The results presented are the means + standard error of 12 experiments. The control R(TM) (before the addition of amiloride) was 21.86 +\/- 0.46 omega x cm2. Basolateral addition of amiloride induced, within 1 minute, an increase in R(TM) to 27.26 +\/- 0.39 omega x cm2, a level that persisted throughout the experiment. When amiloride was added apically, the results were similar with a rapid rise of R(TM) to 24.18 +\/- 0.9 omega x cm2 and subsequent value persistence (p &lt; 0.05). A clear association between R(TM) and active ion transport was shown in previous studies. The results of the present study indicate rapid action of amiloride on the permeability of the visceral peritoneum. The observed increase in the R(TM) indicates the existence of amiloride-sensitive sodium channels in the visceral peritoneal membrane. The clinical implications of these results should be further investigated.","367":"L-Arginine is the substrate for nitric oxide synthesis and may enter cells by the y+ and y+ L transport systems. Peritoneal membrane characteristics may depend on vascular function and the L-arginine-nitric oxide pathway. In a cross-sectional study, we evaluated erythrocyte L-arginine uptake in stable peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with various categories of peritoneal transport function. We used 14C as a marker and N-ethyl-maleimide as an inhibitor of the y+ system to measure maximal uptake capacity (Vma in ulmol\/L cell\/h) and the half-saturation constant (Km in micromol\/L) in erythrocytes. The sample consisted of 41 patients (mean age: 50 +\/- 17 years; 5 with diabetes; 18 men). Mean dialysate-toplasma creatinine (D\/P(Cr)) was 0.62 +\/- 0.14. Peritoneal membrane transport was classified as high, high-average, low-average, or low in 10, 11, 11, and 9 patients, respectively. Mean y+ L Vmax, was 208 +\/- 111 micromol\/L cell\/h, 494 +\/- 893 micromol\/L cell\/h, 222 +\/- 59 micromol\/L cell\/h, and 193 +\/- 63 umol\/L cell\/h [p = 0.404, analysis of variance (ANOVA)] for the high, high-average, low-average, and low transporters respectively. Similarly, mean y+ Vmax was 963 +\/- 1034 micromol\/L cell\/h 843 +\/- 366 micromol\/L cell\/h, 639 +\/- 254 micromol\/L cell\/h, and 774 +\/- 378 micromol\/L cell\/h (p = 0.647, ANOVA). As with Vmax, the y+ L Km and y+ Km values were not significantly different between the various peritoneal transport categories. A negative correlation was observed between y+ Vmax and Kt\/V (r = -0.393, p = 0.011). Erythrocyte uptake of L-arginine does not vary with peritoneal membrane transport characteristics, but maximal L-arginine uptake capacity is higher in patients with a lower Kt\/V.","368":"","369":"Currently, urea kinetic modeling has been accepted for the routine evaluation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) through the calculation of Kt\/V (normalized whole body urea clearance) and nPNA (normalized protein equivalent of total nitrogen appearance). In pediatric dialysis, the exact meaning of and target values for, those parameters is still under debate. We evaluated the mean values and correlations between Kt\/V urea and parameters of nutrition. During a 12-month period, we prospectively performed 186 nitrogen balance studies in pediatric patients on chronic PD. We also assessed daily protein intake (DPI) by nutritional evaluation. Protein, albumin, urea, and creatinine were analyzed in dialysate and urine, collected once monthly. Dialysis adequacy was evaluated using monthly measurements of Kt\/V urea and creatinine clearance (CCr) in urine and dialysate. All statistical comparisons were performed using the paired t-test. Two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures was used to calculate correlations. A p value less than 0.05 was considered significant. We studied 20 patients (15 boys, 5 girls) of mean age 5.1 +\/- 4.7 years (range: 3 months - 14.8 years). Mean DPI in these patients was 3.52 +\/- 1.1 g\/kg\/day. Weekly total Kt\/V urea was 3.41 +\/- 1.35, and residual Kt\/V urea was 1.69 +\/- 1.46. Weekly total and residual CCr were 72.4 +\/- 70 L and 45 +\/- 44 L respectively. Mean protein catabolic rate (PCR) was 0.84 +\/- 0.33 g\/ kg\/day, showing a net nitrogen balance (NB = DPI - PCR) of +1.37 +\/- 0.4 g\/kg\/day. The mean nPNA was 1.38 +\/- 0.40 g\/kg\/day, with positive correlations with DPI, PCR, and total Kt\/V (p &lt; 0.001). Total Kt\/V showed significant positive correlations with PCR (p &lt; 0.001) and nPNA (p &lt; 0.001), but not with NB (p = 0.23) and DPI (p = 0.21). A negative correlation was found between all urea kinetic parameters and plasma bicarbonate (p &lt; 0.001). The values of Kt\/V urea and nPNA in our patients were higher than those recommended in the adult literature. The positive correlations seen between Kt\/V urea and nPCR and nPNA could not be demonstrated between Kt\/V and DPI or NB, suggesting that the correlations could be the result of a mathematical association. The negative correlations between plasma bicarbonate and urea kinetic variables suggest a negative impact of acidosis on nutrition status in our patients.","370":"Renal osteodystrophy (ROD) is one of the mostfrequent complications in pediatric uremic patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and each case requires a different therapeutic approach. In the present study, we characterized ROD in pediatric patients on chronic PD. We studied 20 patients (12 boys, 8 girls) for a 12-month period. The mean age of the patients was 5.82 +\/- 5 years. We allocated each patient to one of three groups according to intact parathormone (iPTH) value: group 1, iPTH &lt; or = 150 pg\/mL, n = 12; group 2, iPTH 151 - 400 pg\/mL, n = 2; and group 3, iPTH &gt; or = 401 pg\/mL, n = 6. Monthly, we recorded plasma calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase; Kt\/V; normalized protein equivalent of total nitrogen appearance (nPNA); and calcitriol dose. Growth was registered as the Z height\/age. Student t-test and analysis of variance for repeated measures were used for the statistical analyses. A value of p &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. All 20 patients completed 6 months of follow-up; 9 patients completed 12 months. At months 1, 6, and 12, vitamin D doses for groups 1 and 3 were significantly different (p &lt; 0.05), as expected. Mean values of iPTH for groups 1 and 3 were 52 +\/- 47 pg\/mL and 1239 +\/- 718 pg\/mL respectively, p &lt; 0.05. At 6 months' follow-up, iPTH values had changed to 163 +\/- 177 pg\/mL for group 1 and 544 +\/- 249 pg\/mL for group 3 (p &lt; 0.05), butfor group 3 that trend was lost at 12 months' follow-up, when their mean iPTH value rose to 972 +\/- 420 pg\/mL. Patients who had been started on PD less than 6 months before entering the study (60% of patients) showed a mean iPTH value of 629.13 pg\/mL. Patients with more than 6 months on dialysis before entering the study showed an iPTH value of 115.53 pg\/mL (p &lt; 0.05). At 6 months' follow-up, iPTH values in groups 1 and 3 both showed a change toward the value range for group 2. At month 12, iPTH values in group 1 continued to show the same tendency, but iPTH values in group 3 showed a tendency to return to their initial levels. Low-turnover ROD was highly prevalent in the study, correlating strongly with time on dialysis.","371":"Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DEXA) can be used to evaluate total-body bone mineral content (BMC), bone mineral density (BMD), fat-free mass (FFM), and fat body mass (FBM), which are all frequently affected in patients (PD) on peritoneal dialysis. We used DEXA to evaluate body composition in children on PD and to establish whether relationships existed with nutrition status, dialytic parameters, and biochemical data. We evaluated 20 PD patients (12 boys, 8 girls). The mean age of the patients was 5.84 years (range: 0.16- 14.66 years). We carried out DEXA, anthropometry (weight\/age, height\/age, and body mass index), and measurements of dietary intake (protein, energy, calcium, and phosphorus), nitrogen balance (NB), dialysis dose (Kt\/V), peritoneal equilibrium test (PET), and plasma calcium, phosphorus, and bicarbonate at months 1 and 6 of the study. Energy intake was prescribed according to the United States Recommended Dietary Allowances, and Kt\/V and daily protein intake (DPI) according to the Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) guidelines. In the patients, BMD increased to 0.769 +\/- 0.174 g\/ cm2 from 0.747 +\/- 0.166 g\/cm2 (p &lt; 0.05), and BMC increased to 680.3 +\/- 666.1 g from 632.6 +\/- 597.5 g (p &lt; 0.01). The mean BMD Z score for patients older than 4 years (n = 11) was -0.69 at month 1, with a significant increase to -0.35 at month 6. The FBM and FFM increased, but without reaching statistical significance. At months 1 and 6, the DPI was 144.3% and 129.9% respectively (p = nonsignificant) and showed a negative correlation with BMD, BMC, and FFM (p &lt; 0.05). Comparing DPI to plasma bicarbonate showed a negative correlation at month 1 (p &lt; 0.05). Negative correlations were also found between NB and the parameters BMD, FBM, and FFM (p &lt; 0.05). be content All patients showed a positive NB. No correlation was found between DEXA and anthropometric measurements, energy intake, serum calcium, serum phosphorus, or Kt\/V Dialysate-to-plasma creatinine from the PET showed a negative correlation with BMD and FFM (p &lt; 0.05). In terms of positive NB and controlled Kt\/V we observed an increase in bone mineralization within the 6 months offollow-up. A high protein intake seems to negatively affect acid-base status, bone mineralization, and FFM.","372":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions with amino acids (AAs) were developed as an alternative to glucose-based PD solutions for chronic renal failure. Although AA solution has many theoretical advantages, the results reported in the literature are still not convincing. Treatment of ARF is a complex problem. To tackle it, we investigated a PD solution based on a mixture of Nutrineal (Baxter Healthcare SA, Castlebar, Ireland) and Dianeal (Baxter Healthcare SA), mixed on the heating plate of the PAC Xtra cycler (Baxter Healthcare SA). The resulting solution was expected to lower the glucose load without affecting dialysis adequacy. We retrospectively analyzed data in children treated with the mixture, and evaluated safety, dialysis adequacy, acidosis, and nutritional state (albumin). Glucose reabsorption and protein losses were significantly lower when mixed AA-glucose solution was used. Despite significant AA absorption in the patients, we observed no significant difference in plasma albumin levels. Reabsorption from the dialysate of AAs varied between 21% and 69%, resulting in 27% +\/- 12% of daily AA intake. Reabsorption of glucose from the dialysate was 32% - 72%. In children in intensive care, who are often already very sensitive, an AA-containing mixture may help to control glycemia, subsequently reducing the need for insulin. Our data demonstrate that the calculated percentage reabsorption of glucose and AAs is high and that AA levels in plasma remain stable. Although our data do not demonstrate a potential influence on final outcome, they demonstrate the feasibility and safety of using combined AA-glucose solution, with a calculated resorption that lends nutritional support.","373":"The aim of peritoneal dialysis (PD) remains to deliver \"appropriate\" renal replacement therapy, including sufficient ultrafiltration, correction of acid-base balance, and adequate dialysis dose. We switched our pediatric patients on automated PD from standard lactate-buffered glucose solution (Dianeal: Baxter Healthcare SA, Castlebar, Ireland) to bicarbonate\/lactate-buffered solution (Physioneal: Baxter Healthcare SA) as soon as it became available in our country. We also decided to deliver \"optimal\" dialysis in children by prescribing a long daytime dwell with icodextrin solution (Extraneal: Baxter Healthcare SA). But, adding those three benefits together--APD, Physioneal, and a long dwell with icodextrin--the result, at least in children, was a possible overcorrection of acidosis and an evolution to alkalosis. Thought must be given to developing solutions with varying bicarbonate concentrations for various treatment modalities.","374":"In the present study, we surveyed 425 members of the American Pediatric Surgical Association and the Canadian Association of Pediatric Surgeons to identify prevalent operative techniques used in the placement of peritoneal dialysis catheters by pediatric surgeons. Our survey assessed catheter type, skin and fascial incision orientations, deep-cuff positions, exit-site directions, and omentectomy. We received responses from 156 surgeons (36.7%) and excluded 18 of those responses. Among the assessed responses, 83 surgeons (60%) indicated that they had placed at least 1 catheter in the previous 12 months. Of the 83, 13% had placed 1 catheter, 52% had placed 2 - 5, 16% had placed 6 - 9, and 18% had placed 10+. We observed significant variability in all aspects of surgical technique. The most common catheter configuration was single-cuff (59%), curled end (60%), and non swan neck (72%). The most common surgical approach was a transverse skin incision (52%), a fascial incision through the rectus (68%), a deep cuff between the peritoneum and fascia (46%), a superior-pointing exit site (37%), and a superficial cuff distant to the exit site (53%). Routine omentectomy was reported by 59% of respondents. Only 15% reported using a laparoscopic approach on first attempt. Pediatric surgeons employ a variety of surgical techniques when placing peritoneal catheters. Some of the techniques used vary from the published recommendations. Quality can potentially be improved by wider dissemination of published surgical recommendations.","375":"The minute-to-minute effect on blood glucose levels of high-dextrose peritoneal dialysate is not known. We arranged for 7 patients with diabetes, treated by peritoneal dialysis (PD), to wear a continuous glucose monitoring system (CGMS: Medtronic MiniMed, Northridge, CA, U.S.A.). A sensor was inserted subcutaneously into the skin of the patient's abdomen or back to measure glucose in the interstitial fluid. Readings were recorded every 5 minutes for up to 72 hours. The portion of the day during which the patient's blood glucose levels were greater than 180 mg\/dL (calculated as a percentage of time) was recorded. Most of the patients participating in the study had elevated levels of glycohemoglobin and hemoglobin A1c, and, for a large percentage of the day, showed blood glucose tracings well above the recommended standards of control. Representative CGMS tracings from patients with type 1 and type 2 diabetes are shown.","376":"Anorexia and malnutrition are common complications and powerful predictors of morbidity and mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Megestrol acetate (MA) is a progestogen that has been demonstrated to increase appetite and weight in patients with cancer or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome. To determine whether MA might benefit PD patients, we treated 32 patients with 160 mg MA daily. Treatment lasted a mean of 5.93 +\/- 5.12 months (range: 1 - 23 months). In 68.8% of the patients, appetite improved. Weight gain was statistically significant starting in the third month (initial weight: 66.5 +\/- 11.4 kg; weight at third month: 68 +\/- 10.4 kg; p &lt; 0.05). We observed a nonsignificant increase in serum albumin at the third treatment month (initial serum albumin: 3.44 +\/- 0.27 g\/L; serum albumin at third month: 3.54 +\/- 0.27 g\/L; p = 0.45). No side effects were observed. Our experience suggests that treatment with 160 mg MA daily in PD patients leads to an increase in appetite, serum albumin, and weight gain in most patients, with no negative side effects.","377":"Measuring the free:total ratio of prostate-specific antigen (f\/t-PSA) can improve the specificity of single-serum PSA values, distinguishing between benign prostatic hyperplasia (BPH) and prostatic carcinoma (PCa) in men over the age of 50. Additionally, clinical trials have shown that dihydroxyvitamin D3 can slow the rate of PSA rise in PCa patients. However, little is known regarding the applicability of those findings in men undergoing chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD). In the present study, we investigated the prevalence of increased serum PSA levels among CPD patients and correlated those values with serum levels of vitamin D [25-hydroxyvitamin D3 and 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3]. We undertook a cross-sectional study of 71 male CPD patients without a known history of prostate cancer from 24 centers in Canada, Greece, and Turkey. All of the patients were more than 50 years of age. In these patients, we measured serum concentrations of PSA, free PSA (f-PSA), total PSA (t-PSA), prostate alkaline phosphatase (PAP), 25-hydroxyvitamin D3, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). We recorded serum PSA levels &lt; 4 ng\/mL in 62 patients (87.3%, group A) and levels &gt; 4 ng\/mL in 9 patients (12.7%, group B). The f\/t-PSA ratio was &lt; 0.25 in 16 patients (22.5%). Group B patients were older than those in group A (median: 73 years vs. 65 years, p &lt; 0.01) and had a lower body weight (median: 66.5 kg vs. 76.7 kg, p &lt; 0.05). We observed no statistically significant difference between the two groups for serum 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (median: 9.8 ng\/mL vs. 10.1 ng\/mL) or 25-hydroxyvitamin D3 (8 ng\/mL vs. 8.2 ng\/mL) levels. Also, we observed no correlation between vitamin D levels and f\/t-PSA, but iPTH levels were significantly higher in group A (200.5 pg\/mL vs. 61.2 pg\/mL, p &lt; 0.04). Also, serum PAP levels correlated significantly with PSA (r = 0.49, p = 0.01) and with f-PSA (r = 0.56, p = 0.000). Our results showed no clear relationship between vitamin D and serum levels of PSA or-of f\/t-PSA in PD patients. However, further studies are needed to better define the uses of these PSA markers in PD patients because, in such patients, other relevant factors might be implicated in their predictive value.","378":"Failure of the pancreatic beta cells to produce insulin or development of defective molecular signaling of insulin to the peripheral tissue cells (insulin resistance) induces persistent hyperglycemia and accumulation of fatty acids in the blood of patients with diabetes. Over time, those changes lead to microvascular and macrovascular damage in various target organs. In patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), complications may accelerate with treatment using conventional glucose-containing solutions. Strategies for proper glycemic control in diabetic PD patients are therefore essential to prevent complications and to maintain a good quality of life. Dietary restrictions and weight control remain the foundation of the management approach for glycemic control. Further therapeutic actions include the stepwise addition of oral hypoglycemic agents and insulin, based on individual assessment of PD patients. Other strategies of immediate importance in reducing hyperglycemia are to use PD exchanges with new non glucose PD solutions (such as those with icodextrin or amino acids) in combination with fewer daily exchanges of low-glucose solutions. Combined, these approaches will sufficiently control hyperglycemia in diabetic PD patients. Research is in progress to develop therapeutic agents aimed at correcting various molecular defects of insulin signaling or at reducing protein kinase C activation induced by oxidative stresses in various tissue cells. Clinical experience with the use of such agents in diabetic PD patients is limited at present.","379":"Anorexia-associated malnutrition is a severe complication that increases mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Ghrelin is a recently-discovered orexigenic hormone with actions in brain and stomach. We analyzed, in 42 PD patients, the possible relationship between ghrelin and appetite regulation with regard to other orexigens [neuropeptide Y (NPY), NO3] and anorexigens [cholecystokinin (CCK), leptin, glucose-dependent insulinotropic peptide (GIP), tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha)]. All orexigens and anorexigens were determined in plasma. Eating motivation was evaluated using a visual analog scale (VAS). The patients were divided into three groups: those with anorexia (n = 12), those with obesity associated with high intake (n = 12), and those with no eating behavior disorders (n = 18). A control group of 10 healthy volunteers was also evaluated. Mean plasma levels of ghrelin were high (3618.6 +\/- 1533 mg\/mL), with 36 patients showing values above the normal range (&lt; 2600 mg\/mL). Patients with anorexia had lower ghrelin and NPY levels and higher peptide-C, CCK, interleukin-1 (IL-1), TNFalpha, and GIP levels than did the other patients. Patients with anorexia also had an early satiety score and low desire and pleasure in eating on the VAS and diet survey. We observed significant positive linear correlations between ghrelin and albumin (r = 0.43, p &lt; 0.05), prealbumin (r = 0.51, p &lt; 0.05), transferrin (r = 0.4, p &lt; 0.05), growth hormone (r = 0.66, p &lt; 0.01), NO3 (r = 0.36, p &lt; 0.05), and eating motivation (VAS). At the same time, negative relationships were observed between blood ghrelin and GIP (r = -0.42, p &lt; 0.05), insulin (r = -0.4, p &lt; 0.05), leptin (r = -0.45, p &lt; 0.05), and creatinine clearance [r = -0.33, p = 0.08 (nonsignificant)]. Ghrelin levels were not related to Kt\/V or to levels of CCK and cytokines. Ghrelin plasma levels are elevated in PD patients. Uremic patients with anorexia show relatively lower ghrelin plasma levels than the levels seen in obese patients or in patients with normal appetite. The role of ghrelin in appetite modulation is altered in uremic PD patients, and that alteration is possibly associated with disorders in insulin and growth hormone metabolism.","380":"Disturbances in immunity and nutrition status worsen in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with advancing age. In the present study, we evaluated variations in total lymphocyte count (TLC) and subset lymphocyte counts (SLCs) with respect to the age of PD patients. We carried out the study in two groups of PD patients. Group I patients (n = 12) were less than 40 years of age (35.5 +\/- 5.4 years), and their PD duration was 18.2 +\/- 9.4 months. Group II patients (n = 14) were more than 60 years of age (67.2 +\/- 5.1 years), and their PD duration was 20.6 +\/- 11.0 months. In group I, 9 patients were taking angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs); in group II, 10 patients were taking ACEIs. We used flow cytometry to estimate SLCs (determining CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD16+56 antigens). In both groups, the mean CD19, CD4, and CD8 counts were lower than the normal ranges. In group II, TLC and CD3 count were also lower than normal. In group I, correlations were seen between age and TLC, CD3, CD19, CD4, and CD8. Correlations were also seen between dialysis duration and TLC, CD3, CD19, and CD4, and between total ACEI dose and CD19 count. In group II, correlations were seen between age and TLC, CD3, and CD8. No correlation was observed between PD duration and TLC or SLCs, but a correlation between total ACEI dose and CD8 count was seen. In patients who were taking enalapril as their only ACEI, a correlation was observed between total enalapril dose and TLC, CD3, and CD8. Our results confirm data that indicate worse immunity and nutrition status in older PD patients and demonstrate decreasing values of TLC and SLCs with aging in younger and older PD patients alike. Administration of ACEIs negatively influences SLCs independently of age, but decreases in TLC and SLCs are significantly related to PD duration only in younger patients.","381":"The concentration of cancer antigen 125 (CA125) in dialysis effluent is considered a marker of mesothelial cell mass, and its concentration in serum is considered a nonspecific marker of peritoneal irritation. Interleukin-15 (IL-15) is a proinflammatory cytokine, playing a role in the initiation of an inflammatory state and supporting the continuation of that state by its influence on the production of other cytokines and on the function of neutrophils, natural killer cells, and T and B cells. In the present study, we performed a correlation analysis between serum CA125, IL-15, and parameters of nutrition in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. We measured IL-15 and CA125 in the serum of 42 patients without clinical signs of infection [age: 52.3 +\/- 14.4 years; time on PD: 24.5 +\/- 20.1 months (range: 0.4 - 72.8 months)]. The IL-15 levels were estimated by ELISA (IBL, Hamburg, Germany) and CA125 levels by immunoenzymatic assay (Roche Diagnostics, Warsaw, Poland). Serum IL-15 concentration was 78.9 +\/- 163.4 pg\/mL (median: 25.0 pg\/mL; range: 0.0- 857.1 pg\/mL), and serum CA125 concentration was 20.0 +\/- 18.6 U\/mL (median: 15.1 U\/mL; range: 5.6- 119.1 U\/mL). Serum IL-15 concentration showed a significant correlation with serum albumin concentration (r = -0.442, p = 0.003). Serum CA125 concentration correlated with total creatinine clearance (r = -0.322, p = 0.037), lean body mass (r = -0.414, p = 0.007), total body mass (r = -0.360, p = 0.019), total body water (r = -0.436, p = 004 0.004), body surface area (r = -0.368, p = 0.018), serum iron concentration (r = -0.378, p = 0.014), transferrin saturation (r = -0.436, p = 0.004), mean cell hemoglobin concentration (r = -0.324, p = 0.036), and serum albumin concentration as a percentage of total protein level (r = -0.547, p = 0.002). We conclude that, in PD patients, elevated serum IL-15 and CA125 suggest a persistent inflammatory state that negatively influences nutrition status.","382":"Conventional peritoneal dialysis solution (PDS) relaxes visceral and parietal peritoneal arterioles (microvessels) by unclear mechanisms. The present study was originally designed to investigate the mechanisms of PDS-mediated vascular reactivity. Surprisingly, our preliminary data indicated that PDS induces contraction in large vessels such as the aorta. That result contrasts with the relaxation observed in the microvasculature. We therefore extended the study to (1) determine the effect of PDS on the superior mesenteric artery (SMA), (2) confirm the PDS-induced contraction in the aorta, and (3) determine if a prostanoid and nitric oxide are involved in the observed PDS-induced vessel response. Rat SMA rings with intact endothelium and aortic rings with and without endothelium were prepared and placed in baths filled with a non vasoactive physiologic salt solution (PSS), or with PSS plus mefenamic acid (MFA, a cyclo-oxygenase inhibitor), or PSS plus NG-monomethyl-L-arginine (L-NMMA, an inhibitor of nitric oxide synthase) under a force transducer. We recorded changes in tension throughout the protocols. After equilibration, the baths were filled with a conventional glucose-based PDS (Delflex 2.5%: Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) with and without MFA or L-NMMA for 30 minutes. The rings were then washed, contracted with phenylephrine, and relaxed with acetylcholine to verify the presence or absence of endothelium. In both SMA and aorta, PDS induced contraction. That contraction was suppressed by MFA [SMA: 0.57 g vs. 0.13 g (+\/- 0.035 g); aorta: 0.88 g vs. 0.27 g (+\/- 0.035 g); p &lt; 0.05 by analysis of variance (ANOVA)]. Aortic contraction induced by PDS was not altered by L-NMMA. Conventional PDS induces contraction in large vessels, in contrast to its action of relaxation in microvessels. Vascular reactivity in large vessels involves the production of a constrictor prostanoid in the vascular smooth muscle. Peritoneal dialysis solutions do not induce NO in aortic endothelium. Peritoneal dialysis solution-induced, prostanoid-mediated contraction of smooth muscle may contribute to a worsening of hypertension and the premature uterine contractions observed in the rare cohort of pregnant uremic patients on peritoneal dialysis.","383":"Standard glucose-based peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions have unfavorable effects on the peritoneum and contribute to metabolic abnormalities. A PD regimen in which solutions with an alternative osmotic agent (icodextrin, amino acids) and solutions with a bicarbonate\/lactate buffer are combined may reduce those effects. In a prospective crossover study, we randomized new continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients to one of two groups. One group used 4 exchanges of standard PD (SPD) solution (Dianeal: Baxter Healthcare BV, Utrecht, Netherlands) daily. The second group used 1 exchange of Nutrineal (Baxter Healthcare BV), 1 exchange of Extraneal (Baxter Healthcare BV), and 2 exchanges of Physioneal (Baxter Healthcare BV) daily (NEPP). After 30 weeks of treatment, each group switched over to the other regimen for 24 weeks. Statistical analysis used analysis of variance (ANOVA) for repeated measurements. Of the 74 patients enrolled into the study, 50 completed the full study period (24 NEPP-SPD, 26 SPD-NEPP). With regard to daily ultrafiltration and dialysis efficacy (Kt\/V), the NEPP regimen was as efficacious as the standard regimen. The NEPP regimen was found to be safe: body weight, blood pressure, decline in urine volume, residual creatinine clearance, and laboratory measurements did not differ statistically significantly from those measured in the standard regimen. The NEPP regimen was well tolerated and was not accompanied by serious side effects. During the NEPP regimen, bicarbonate was found to be significantly higher in both groups. The NEPP regimen is a feasible treatment schedule for patients starting CAPD.","384":"In the present study, we evaluated peritoneal transport characteristics during the use of icodextrin-based peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution, determining ultrafiltration (UF) and dialysate-to-plasma creatinine (D\/P(Cr)) in a peritoneal equilibration test (PET). The subjects of the study were 8 anuric patients who, at the time of enrollment into the study, were receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and using a 2.5% glucose-based dialysis solution overnight. The mean age of the patients was 57.9 +\/- 6.1 years (range: 45.2 - 64.1 years), and their mean duration of CAPD was 61.6 +\/- 44.3 months (range: 5.6 - 140.1 months). We changed the 2.5% glucose solution that the patients were using for the 8-hour overnight dwell to icodextrin and measured the resulting UF. We also performed a PET before and 12 weeks after the start of icodextrin. After the start of icodextrin, PETs were carried out immediately after the icodextrin dwell; after rinsing twice with 2.5% glucose solution following an icodextrin dwell; and after an 8-hour dwell with glucose solution. The UF for 8-hour dwells increased significantly 12 weeks after the start of icodextrin (356.3 +\/- 102.9 mL with 2.5% glucose at baseline vs. 517.5 +\/- 102.8 mL with icodextrin, p &lt; 0.001). However, the daily total UF was unchanged after the start of icodextrin (924.3 +\/- 281.3 mL vs. 934.6 +\/- 263.4 mL). As compared with the D\/P(Cr) before the start of icodextrin, the D\/P(Cr) after the start of icodextrin was significantly increased immediately after an icodextrin dwell (0.57 +\/- 0.1 vs. 0.63 +\/- 0.1, p &lt; 0.01) and after twice rinsing with 2.5% glucose solution following an icodextrin dwell (0.57 +\/- 0.1 vs. 0.66 +\/- 0.2, p &lt; 0.01). However, before or after the start of icodextrin, the D\/P(Cr) after an 8-hour dwell with glucose solution did not change (0.57 +\/- 0.1 vs. 0.57 +\/- 0.1, p &lt; 0.01). The D\/P(Cr) measured in a PET was high immediately after a dwell with icodextrin. Those results may reflect an effect of icodextrin on the small pores. Before a PET, dialysis should be performed using a glucose solution.","385":"The development of biocompatible peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDFs) is one of the most significant improvements in the field. The evolution of PDFs can be divided into three phases: (1) identification of the problems; (2) basic laboratory studies and formulation of alternative solutions; and (3) clinical testing of the new alternatives. A summary of representative work for each of these phases, together with insights into future developments, is provided.","386":"Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD), and hypertension and volume expansion are highly prevalent in long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The ADEMEX study made it clear that increased small-solute clearance does not lead to better outcomes. To manage the problem, current clinical practice uses strategies of dietary salt and fluid restriction, diuretics, antihypertensive drugs, icodextrin, extra day dwells, and (as a last resort) PD combined with hemodialysis (HD) or switch to HD. Nevertheless, the prevalence of hypertension remains alarmingly high. In this article, we briefly discuss the therapeutic measures currently available for treating hypertension and volume overload in PD patients, the limitations of those measures, and the possibility of increasing sodium removal by reducing the dialysate sodium level.","387":"The use of silicone peritoneal catheters, connected to implanted subcutaneous mini vascular access ports, was an essential step in the development of a widely used rat model for peritoneal dialysis (PD). Despite the model's many advantages, it has one major disadvantage: a high drop-out rate because of omental wrapping of the silicone catheter. To investigate whether heparinization of the peritoneal catheter reduces the high drop-out rate in the model, we infused rats with conventional PD fluid through either a regular silicone catheter (PDF, n = 14) or a heparin-coated catheter (PDF-h, n = 15) daily for 5 weeks. Untreated rats served as a control group (control, n = 7). We used various peritoneal tissues for cellular and morphologic analysis by light and electron microscopy. We found a statistically significant, lower rate of drop-out in rats implanted with heparin-coated catheters (20%) than in rats implanted with regular silicone catheters (57%, p &lt; 0.05). No significant differences were seen between the two treated groups with regard to the PD fluid-induced angiogenic response in omentum and mesentery. Likewise, instillation of PD fluid resulted in a similar cellular response (increased numbers of mast cells and milky spots in the omentum and mesothelial regeneration on the liver) in both groups regardless of heparin coating. Based on our results, we recommend the use of heparin-coated catheters for instillation of dialysis solutions in the chronic PD model in the rat.","388":"Loss of the peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter is a major cause of PD technique failure and transfer to hemodialysis. In the present study, we report our experience with permanent peritoneal catheters. We prospectively analyzed 125 double-cuff coiled, swan-neck catheters implanted by the open surgical method in 120 patients from January 1996 to June 2003. The patients were evaluated monthly and followed for a total of 2806 patient-months. The mean age of the patients was 55 +\/- 17 years (range: 22 - 91 years); 52% were men; 20% had diabetes; 10% were receiving immunosuppressive treatment; 45% were Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriers; and 93.3% were on automated PD. Catheter survival was 97% at 2 years and 92.2% at 5 years. A total of 59 early and late catheter complications were observed in 36 patients. These included exit-site infection at a rate of 0.125 episodes\/ patient-year. The most frequent noninfectious complications were herniation (8%), leakage (6%), and bloody dialysate (3%). Statistical analysis did not identify variables that predicted the development of exit-site infection. The overall peritonitis rate was 0.149 episodes\/patient-year. Our data suggest that the main catheter complication is infection. The low incidence of infection in our study is probably related more to good installation technique and aftercare than to the clinical characteristics of the patients.","389":"In the present study, we tried to determine the relationship between dialysis dose and nutrition in PD patients. We enrolled 100 Japanese outpatients, including 11 diabetic patients, who were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [CAPD (n = 74)] and automated peritoneal dialysis [APD (n = 26)] at 49 local hospitals. In all patients, a peritoneal function test (PET) was performed using the PD NAVI software (JMS, Hiroshima, Japan). The PD NAVI software measured parameters of nutrition and dialysis dose; percentage creatinine generation rate (%CGR); percentage lean body mass normalized to body weight (%LBM); normalized protein nitrogen appearance (nPNA); total fluid removal (TFR), including urine; weekly total Kt\/V; and creatinine clearance (CCr). The %CGR correlated linearly with %LBM and nPNA, parameters of the nutrition status of the patients. The %CGR also showed a significant linear correlation with Kt\/V, CCr, and TFR. Patients with a %CGR below 100% (the \"low group\") numbered 37 (32 men, 5 women). The CCr and TFR values in that group were lower than the CCr and TFR values in the other patients (the \"high group\"). Conclusively, the dialysis dose did not reach the solute clearance values proposed by the National Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative. That finding may be the result of prescribing and monitoring dialysis therapy based on the PET The %CGR by PD NAVI may become an important index for clinical evaluation of PD dose and optimal dialysis prescription.","390":"Residual renal function (RRF) is an important determinant of survival on dialysis. Preservation of RRF is also important for lowering comorbidity and improving quality of life. Initiation of dialysis is associated with gradual loss of RRF over time. As compared with hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis is reported to be associated with a slower decline of RRF. Also, RRF depends on several factors that may affect its decline independent of dialysis. The analysis of RRF decline on dialysis is therefore complex. The present article examines the issues in detail and provides evidence if one form of dialysis is superior to the other in preserving RRF.","391":"Hydrothorax, an uncommon complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD), results from the migration of dialysis fluid under pressure from the peritoneal cavity into the pleural space. The exact site of the transdiaphragmatic fluid leak remains obscure, but the right-sided predominance of the hydrothorax points to the presence of abnormalities in the right hemidiaphragm. Such abnormalities have occasionally been described. In a recent case of acute massive right hydrothorax at the start of PD, the autopsy revealed extensive changes of amyloidosis that were comparable in both hemidiaphragms, prompting us to revisit the accepted explanation for right hydrothorax. We propose that an embryonic remnant--namely, the persisting pneumatoenteric recess and the infracardiac bursa--provides a passage connecting the peritoneal cavity to the right pleural space. The potential presence of this mechanism is consistent with the recognized clinical features of right hydrothorax complicating PD. This proposed route for dialysis fluid to form a right hydrothorax during PD can be investigated by currently available high-definition imaging techniques. This novel mechanism may also be involved in the pathogenesis of right hydrothorax observed in other medical conditions with tense ascites (liver cirrhosis, Meigs syndrome).","392":"The number of patients over 65 years of age with chronic renal failure has increased. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an effective mode of treatment for such patients. In the present study, we report our experience with automated PD in patients over 65. We recorded the demographic and clinical characteristics of the patients and the exit-site infection rate, the peritonitis rate, and the mortality rate, comparing those parameters with the same parameters in patients under 65. We followed 36 patients (30% of the total study population) who were over 65 years of age (mean: 74.5 +\/- 7.3 years). Of the 36 patients, 34 (94.4%) had another chronic disease--arterial hypertension and heart disease being the more common. Eleven of the patients (31%) had diabetes. Duration of PD therapy in the group was 31.5 +\/- 20.7 months. Ten of the patients (27.8%) had at least 1 catheter-related complication, including exit-site infection (n = 3), tunnel infection (n = 1), or a noninfectious complication (n = 6). The rate of catheter-related infection was 0.22 episodes\/patient-year. Two catheter were lost: 1 in a case of hematoma, and 1 in a case of catheter obstruction. The rate of peritonitis was 0.16 episodes\/patient-year, and the most common infectious agent was methicillin-susceptible Staphylococcus aureus. Actuarial survival of our elderly patients was 51.8% at 4 years of follow-up as compared with 81.7% in the younger patients (p = 0.01). All cases of death were related to comorbid conditions, not to PD therapy. Two patients were transferred to hemodialysis. We conclude that PD has proven to be a safe and comfortable therapy for renal replacement in patients over 65 years of age. Results are similar to results in younger patients.","393":"A measure of comorbidity in dialysis patients must not only predict outcomes but also be reproducible and easy to obtain. Our primary purpose in the present study was to determine the inter-rater reliability of the Charlson comorbidity index (CCI) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Our secondary purpose was to evaluate the usefulness of annual rescoring of the CCI as a predictor of patient survival. We included in the study 100 consecutive patients (mean age: 52 +\/- 16 years; 85% white; 39% with diabetes) who started PD between 1995 and 2000 at a single center: Two nurses independently scored the CCI at the start of PD. One nurse rescored each patient on the yearly anniversary of the start of PD. Patient survival was recorded for each year Kappa score and time-dependent analysis were applied. The kappa score between the two CCI scores at the start of dialysis was 0.93. (The average scores by the two nurses were 5.2 and 5.3.) Annual rescoring of the CCI demonstrated no increase in its predictive value regarding patient survival. However, given the minimal change in the CCI for the patient population in the present study, that question needs further study. Over time, the average CCI fell--an unsurprising result, because patients with higher CCI scores at the start of dialysis are the most likely to die. We conclude that the CCI is a reliable and easily applied tool for assessing comorbidity. Dialysis units should consider obtaining this measure at the start of dialysis in all patients. Repetitive annual scoring was not helpful in improving prediction of survival.","394":"A relative decline in the use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) as a treatment modality has led to much speculation regarding the reasons for the drop. One main concern focuses on the lack of education and training in dialysis options for nephrologists, nurses, and patients. To change the trend and improve clinical outcomes for dialysis patients, the industry is taking a leading role in educating health care professionals and patients about dialysis options. Fresenius Medical Care offers two complementary educational initiatives for physicians, nurses, and patients: PDServe and Kidney Options.","395":"Hypertension is one of the main factors contributing to morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients have been reported to have lower blood pressure (BP) in the first 6 months or so of treatment. After that, their BP can be the same or higher than that seen in hemodialysis (HD) patients. We compared BP control between our PD patients and our HD patients. Systolic BP and pulse pressure were better controlled in PD patients; those PD patients required many fewer drugs. The difference was statistically significant. Anuric PD patients had a BP as good as that of the non anuric PD patients. Because PD is a constant treatment, fluid removal is much easier than in HD. To achieve good BP control, nurses, dieticians, and physicians must all have the same approach: that is, always to be aggressive in volume control as a first measure for achieving an adequate BP The team approach results in better BP control than that seen in HD.","396":"Anemia is one of the most serious complications in patients on dialysis. Erythropoietin improves the anemia. However, erythropoietin resistance is sometimes encountered from causes such as functional iron deficiency, secondary hyperparathyroidism, blood loss, or interaction with other drugs. To clarify the interaction between erythropoietin and the renin-angiotensin system, we studied the maintenance dose of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with and without angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEIs), angiotensin II type I receptor blockers (ARBs), and calcium channel blockers. We divided 36 hypertensive patients on CAPD into three groups--an ACEI group (n = 12), an ARB group (n = 12), and a Ca channel blocker group (n = 12)--and then we compared the doses of rHuEPO required to maintain the patients' hematocrit (Hct) above 30%. In the Ca channel blocker group, the weekly dose of erythropoietin had not changed significantly at the end of the study (74 +\/- 7 U\/kg at the end vs. 76 +\/- 8 U\/kg at the start). The (oral) ACEI group needed a significantly higher weekly dose of erythropoietin at the end of the study (89 -\/+ 9 U\/kg at the end vs. 74 -\/+ 8 U\/kg at the start, p &lt; 0.01). The (oral) ARB group also needed a significantly higher weekly dose of erythropoietin at the end of the study (82 -\/+ 10 U\/kg at the end vs. 76 +\/- 8 U\/kg at the start, p &lt; 0.05). Furthermore, the weekly dose of erythropoietin required in the ACEI group was significantly larger than that required in the ARB group. We conclude that treatment with ACEIs and ARBs induces erythropoietin resistance in patients on CAPD. The inhibitory effect of ARBs on erythropoiesis is less than that of ACEIs.","397":"We have developed a new telemedicine system that uses a cellular telephone and Internet Web site to monitor changes of blood pressure (BP) in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). An I-converter data collection system directly transmits all data on BP and heart rate (HR) measured by a fully automatic device (HEM-705IT: Omron Life Science, Tokyo, Japan) to a cellular telephone. The cellular telephone then sends the data directly to the main server at the NTT DoCoMo data center. All data, including BP and HR from each patient, are accumulated in the server. Application service provider technology (ASP) connects that system directly to the Internet. Any time and anywhere, each patient can use a cellular telephone or the Internet Web site to monitor, in graph form, changes in their data. The average data at each collection point are calculated and shown on the Web site. All data collected by cellular telephone are also calculated and sent directly, in real time, to the physician's office. Currently, we are using this telemedicine system for 44 hypertensive patients on CAPD at our center. In the present study, we used the telemedicine system to evaluate changes in 24-hour BP. We followed 20 CAPD patients, monitoring changes in BP for 3 months. At the end of study, we found that the average daytime home BP was 137 +\/- 8 mmHg over 80 +\/- 4 mmHg and that the average nighttime BP was 128 +\/- 7 mmHg over 72 +\/- 4 mmHg. The overall average home BP was 132 +\/- 7 mmHg over 76 +\/- 3 mmHg. The average outpatient clinic BP was 155 +\/- 9 mmHg over 86 +\/- 5 mmHg. The measured systolic and diastolic BP at the out-patient clinic were significantly higher than those measured at home. As measured at the outpatient clinic, BP indicated that 7 CAPD patients (35%) were hypertensive (&gt; 160\/95 mmHg). However, as measured at home, BP indicated that only 4 CAPD patients (20%) were truly hypertensive (&gt; 135\/85 mmHg). We were therefore able to determine that 43% of our hypertensive patients had \"white coat\" hypertension. Our new telemedicine system that monitors BP by cellular telephone provides great advantages in monitoring BP at home in patients on CAPD.","398":"In the present study, we evaluated the clinical course and outcome of chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) in a group of elderly patients. We enrolled 60 elderly patients (37 men, 23 women) starting PD over a 4-year study period and assessed outcomes. The mean age of our patients was 61 +\/- 7 years; mean PD duration was 16 months (range: 3 - 40 months). Primary diseases were mainly diabetic nephropathy (54%) and glomerulonephritis (20%). In most patients, the PD modality was chosen because of cardiac instability. Complications during PD included peritonitis (1 episode per 9 patient-months) and exit-site infection (1 episode per 26 patient-months). Technique survival was 89% at 1 year. Patient survival was 83% and 32% at 1 and 4 years respectively. The most frequent causes of death were cerebrovascular accident, cardiac complications, and sepsis. We also compared predialysis parameters to final parameters for 20 deceased patients. Mean age in this group was 62 +\/- 8 years, and mean PD duration was 13 +\/- 8 months. Body mass index (BMI) was 23 +\/- 3 kg\/m2 predialysis versus 22 +\/- 3 kg\/m2 at the end of dialysis (p &lt; 0.01); residual renal creatinine clearance was 4.4 +\/- 2 mL\/min versus 2.3 +\/- 2 mL\/min (p &lt; 0.003), and weekly total Kt\/V was 2.1 +\/- 0.3 versus 1.8 +\/- 0.3 (p &lt; 0.002). Albumin showed positive correlations with BMI (r = 0.40, p &lt; 0.02) and with creatinine (r = 0.40, p &lt; 0.01). We conclude that survival of elderly patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis is reasonable in the first year, and that further improvement may be achieved by initiating dialysis early, by increasing the dialysis dose, and by improving the patients' nutrition status.","399":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD)for renal replacement therapy (RRT) is safe and effective in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Currently, no data exist for the same in patients at correctional institutions [Department of Corrections (DOC)]. We compared demographic characteristics of, and the efficacy and outcome of self-administered continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in, DOC patients with data from the U.S. Renal Data System for the free-living population (FLP). We retrospectively reviewed the charts of DOC patients opting for CAPD (n = 10) in the last 7 years. Baseline data (age, race, cause of ESRD, serum chemistries, anemia, bone profiles, and Kt\/V) were obtained for dialysis start and 6 - 12 months after dialysis start. Major events, including switches to hemodialysis (HD), hospitalizations, and deaths, were also studied. The median age of the DOC patients was 45 years. The group was 40% black, 30% white, and 30% Hispanic. Cause of renal failure was diabetes in 30%, HIV-associated nephropathy in 30%, primary glomerular disease in 20%, and hypertension or unknown in 20% of patients. The DOC patients had higher levels of blood urea nitrogen (BUN) at presentation, but better anemia profiles than did the FLP. Complications included peritonitis, fluid leaks, and cardiac events. Median age at dialysis start is lower for DOC patients, and HIV-associated nephropathy is more common than in the FLP. Levels of BUN\/creatinine were much higher in DOC patients, but hemoglobin levels were similar to those in the FLP. Hospitalization rates for peritonitis were comparable; cardiac disease was common in both groups. Self-CAPD can be safely and effectively performed in DOC patients.","400":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has seldom been reported in patients developing end-stage renal disease (ESRD) after liver transplantation (LTx). Here we present our recent experience with PD in 5 such patients. Of the 5 patients, 3 were men and 2 were women. Average age at initiation of PD was 64.6 years (range: 54 - 72 years). Chronic renal failure (CRF) was diagnosed an average of 3.8 years (range: 1 - 7 years) post transplant and resulted in ESRD an average of 9.2 years (range: 6 - 15 years) after LTx. Calcineurin inhibitor toxicity was the presumed causative factor in all 5 patients, with biopsy confirmation in 2. All of the patients had hypertension at the time of diagnosis of CRF, 2 had coronary artery disease, and 1 developed diabetes mellitus. No patient had ascites before PD initiation. Peritoneal dialysis catheter implantation was uneventful in all patients. Average duration of follow-up was 13.6 months (range: 6 - 29 months). Three episodes of peritonitis occurred in 2 patients (coagulase-negative staphylococcus, Staphylococcus aureus, and Acinetobacter). All episodes of peritonitis responded to standard treatment. Clearance was found to be adequate in all but 1 patient. One patient died 19 months after initiation of PD. At the time of writing, the remaining 4 patients are alive on PD after an average of 12.2 months (range: 6 - 29 months). We conclude that PD is a viable and safe option for managing ESRD that develops after LTx.","401":"Noncompliance (NC) with the dialysis prescription has been described as a common problem in dialysis patients. In previous studies, NC in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients has been assessed by obtaining patient or family histories, using questionnaires, and making home visits. With the use of the HomeChoice Pro Chip Card (PCC: Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.), the dialysis staff can monitor the total volume of dialysate used, the frequency of exchanges, and the duration of dialysis in patients maintained on automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). Last year, we reported that the PCC was an effective tool for assessing compliance and noted that more than half of patients had a compliance rate (CR) &lt; 95%. In the present study, we examined the impact of patient education on compliance with the prescribed dialysis regimen. We evaluated our APD patients for CR with their dialysis prescription. The PCC was used to record the duration of dialysis and the actual volume of fluid used. From October 2002 to September 2003, all patients maintained at home for 3 consecutive months on APD in the New Haven continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis unit were educated concerning the importance of compliance with their dialysis regimen. They were also educated about the function of the PCC and were informed that the dialysis facility would be monitoring their compliance with the prescribed regimen. Compliance rates were calculated by dividing the delivered dialysis volume by the prescribed dialysis volume and multiplying by 100. We obtained data on 42 APD patients. Of the 42 patients, 35 (83%) had a CR &gt; or = 95%, 3 (7%) had a CR between 90% and 94.9%, and 4 (10%) had a CR &lt; 90%. Those CRs are much better than the ones we had previously reported, before the institution of the patient education program. The PCC can be used to assess compliance in APD patients. Patient education results in an improvement in patient compliance. Further study is required to determine factors that affect CR in APD patients.","402":"Hernias can lead to significant morbidity in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). We studied the natural history and outcome of incarcerated hernia (IH), with or without bowel strangulation (IHS), in PD patients. We performed a retrospective chart review on all PD patients who developed an IH (n = 11) or an IHS (7\/11) in the last 12 years. Of the 11 patients, 54% were female. The age range was 36 - 86 years (median: 61 years). Seven patients had a known history of a hernia that went on to become the index hernia that incarcerated with or without strangulation. The hernia types were umbilical (n = 8), inguinal (n = 2), and incisional in the area of the PD catheter (n = 1). Clinical presentations included painless abdominal mass (2 patients); tender and painful abdominal mass (4 patients); and abdominal pain, tenderness, and bowel obstruction (5 patients). Nine hernias were treated surgically--5 of them emergently for bowel ischemia. The other 4 patients who had incarcerated, non strangulated hernias were operated electively. One patient with IHS had the hernia manually reduced, and 1 patient with IHS had the hernia manually reduced and subsequently operated electively. Three patients with IHS and 2 with IH required temporary hemodialysis for between 4 days and 21 days. In PD patients, IHs are most commonly umbilical and have a propensity to strangulate. Patients treated operatively have an excellent prognosis and are usually able to continue PD. Abdominal wall hernias should be referred early to minimize mechanical complications.","403":"Obesity shortens survival in the general population. In hemodialysis (HD), obesity is associated with improved short-term survival (around 3 years). The discrepancy in the survival of obese patients between HD and the general population may be attributable to survival bias. (Only a small percentage of patients with renal failure survive until HD, and they may have certain survival advantages, including obesity.) Bias is introduced through the mixture of prevalent and incident HD patients in most studies, better nutrition in obese HD patients, malnutrition-inflammation complex syndrome causing weight loss, or other reasons. In studies of peritoneal dialysis (PD), obesity has been associated with decreased patient survival, no noticeable effect on survival, and increased survival. Potential reasons for the differences include bias in the selection of PD for obese patients, effects of race, chronic inflammation in obese PD patients, differences in nutrition and adequacy of PD, adverse effects of the increased PD dose needed to achieve adequate small-solute clearances, differences in body composition, and time discrepancies among risk factors having opposite effects on PD patient survival. Some evidence exists that in the long-term (&gt; 10 years), obesity is a risk factor for death in both HD and PD. Further studies are needed to identify the short- and long-term risks and benefits of obesity in the two dialysis modalities.","404":"The antibiotic treatment currently recommended by the International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis (ISPD) for peritonitis consists of a combination of a first- and a third-generation cephalosporin. The schedule formerly recommended combined a first-generation cephalosporin and an aminoglycoside. No comparison between the treatment schedules has been performed until now. We compared the effectiveness of these two regimens in peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis at our center. From January 1999 to April 2000, we followed 107 patients in our PD clinic (period 1: 47% men; 32% with diabetes; mean age: 52 +\/- 13 years). We followed a similar number of patients from January 2002 to July 2003 (period 2: 109 patients; 54% men; 51% with diabetes; mean age: 56 +\/- 18 years). In each period, diagnosis and treatment of peritonitis were based on the recommendations of the ISPD as earlier described. Negative culture rates were similar in period 1 and period 2 (32% vs. 30%). In both study groups, the bacteria that most commonly caused peritonitis were Staphylococcus epidermidis (period 1: 41%; period 2: 39%) and S. aureus (period 1: 27%; period 2: 18%). Gram-positive infections occurred in 59% of patients during period 1 and in 57% during period 2. Gram-negative infections occurred in 16% of patients during period 1 and in 18% during period 2. We observed no significant difference in the peritonitis cure rate from period 1 to period 2 (78% vs. 83%; chi-square: 0.98; p = 0.3), but changes in the primary antibiotic schedule were necessary in 4 patients in period 1 as compared with 1 patient in period 2. The rates of catheter removal were not significantly different during the two periods (period 1: 14%; period 2: 5%; chi-square: 2.5; p = 0.11). Mortality was also not significantly different during the two periods (period 1: 7%; period 2: 5%; chi-square: 0.23; p = 0.62). The two antibiotic schedules were equally effective in the treatment of peritonitis. Cost-effectiveness, impact on residual renal function, and potential development of bacterial resistance must be considered when selecting the antibiotic schedule for peritonitis treatment.","405":"Relapsing peritonitis is usually attributable to persistent catheter infection, assuming that the appropriate antibiotic is used to treat each time and that intraabdominal pathology has been ruled out. Removal of the peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter frequently is curative. We describe here a case in which partial removal of a presternal catheter resulted in resolution of relapsing peritonitis.","406":"In the present study, we evaluated the effects of once-weekly mupirocin application to catheter exit sites on Staphylococcus aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS) colonization and investigated the resistance of those bacteria to methicillin (MeR) and mupirocin (MuR). We enrolled 36 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients (mean age: 55.1 +\/- 1.4 years) into the study. The patients (men\/women: 21\/15) had been applying mupirocin to the catheter exit site once weekly before the start of the study (mupirocin treatment duration: 3.1 +\/- 2.0 years). During the study period, swabs were taken monthly from the nares, axillae, inguinal area, and catheter exit site. The swabs were inoculated on blood plates. Methicillin and mupirocin susceptibility were tested by disc diffusion according to the interpretative criteria of the National Committee for Clinical Laboratory Standards. We evaluated a total of 144 cultures. Among CNS isolates, the MuR was 66%, and the MeR was 38.8%. At the start of the study period, 3 patients were S. aureus nasal carriers. In nasal swabs, no MeR S. aureus was identified, and only 1 MuR S. aureus was found. Once-weekly application of mupirocin at the exit site in CAPD patients led to comparable rates of colonization by MuR S. aureus as did thrice-weekly or more frequent application. Clinical results showing high mupirocin and methicillin resistance in CNS are controversial.","407":"In the present study, we prospectively investigated the effects of once- or thrice-weekly prophylactic application of mupirocin to catheter exit sites on Staphylococcus aureus carriage, methicillin and mupirocin resistance, and catheter-related infections in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. We enrolled 36 CAPD patients (men\/women: 21\/ 15; mean age: 55.1 +\/- 1.4 years) in the study. At the start of the study, patients had been on once-weekly mupirocin treatment for 3.1 +\/- 2.0 years. They were then randomly assigned to use mupirocin either once weekly (group I; n = 18; men\/women: 10\/8; age: 55.3 +\/- 1.8 years) or thrice weekly (group II; n = 18; men\/women: 11\/7; age: 55.0 +\/- 2.3 years). During the study period, swabs were taken monthly from nares, axillae, the inguinal area, and the catheter exit site. We evaluated a total of 806 samples in the first 6 months of the study. The two study groups were similar in terms of age and sex. In group I, 5 isolations of S. aureus in 3 patients came from initial S. aureus carriers. During the first 6 months of the study, only 2 new S. aureus carriers were detected in group I, for a total of 7 isolations. Mupirocin resistance (MuR) was present in only 1 isolate and methicillin resistance (MeR) was not observed. In group II, no S. aureus carriers were present at the initial evaluation, and we encountered only 1 new S. aureus carrier during the first 6 months of the study. During the same period, MuR and MeR were absent in group II. During the 6 months, we observed 1 exit-site infection and 1 peritonitis episode attributable to coagulase-negative staphylococcus (CNS) in group I. In group II, we observed 1 exit-site infection attributable to CNS. During the first 6 months of the study, once- or thrice-weekly application of mupirocin to the catheter exit site has not led to any significant change in S. aureus carriage, MeR and MuR, or catheter-related infection in our CAPD patients.","408":"Infections with Candida species have been associated with significant morbidity and mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Such infections include peritonitis and exit-site infections attributable to Candida species, disseminated candidiasis in immunocompromised patients, and Candida esophagitis. In peritonitis and exit-site infections, both success and failure have been reported with commercially available medications. In disseminated candidiasis and Candida esophagitis, successful treatment and patient recovery depend on the overall nutritional and immune state of the patient. One case each of peritonitis and exit-site infection with non Candida albicans species were successfully treated with oral voriconazole. No literature currently exists on the use of this new product in dialysis patients. Presented here is a treatment strategy that resulted in maintenance of PD in the home setting and catheter survival following completion of treatment. A review of the English-language literature shows mixed outcomes associated with continuation of PD during treatment for Candida infection in PD patients. In conclusion, a commercially available product can be used to successfully treat PD patients who have Candida infections and to maintain the PD catheter for PD.","409":"Peritonitis is one of the most serious complications of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Approximately 20% of peritonitis infections have been reported to be resistant to initial therapy, either failing to resolve with appropriate antibiotics or relapsing within 2 weeks of antibiotic discontinuation. To investigate the current situation with regard to resistant peritonitis, we retrospectively examined the incidence and the organisms of resistant peritonitis in our unit over a period of 9 years. From January 1, 1994, to January 1, 2003, we introduced 325 patients onto CAPD. At January 1, 2003, we followed up 172 patients who were receiving CAPD in our unit. During 1994-1996, 12 cases of peritonitis and 3 cases of resistant peritonitis (25%) occurred among our patients. Microbiologic examination revealed that the organisms involved in peritonitis were alpha-streptococcus (17%), coagulase-negative staphylococcus [CNS (17%)], and methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus [MSSA (17%)]. The organisms of resistant peritonitis were methicillin-resistant S. aureus [MRSA (67%)] and methicillin-resistant CNS (33%). During 1997-1999, 39 cases of peritonitis and 13 cases of resistant peritonitis (33%) occurred among our patients. The most frequently cultured organisms in peritonitis were CNS (26%), Candida species (13%), and alpha-streptococcus (10%). The organisms of resistant peritonitis were methicillin-resistant CNS (46%) and Candida species (38%). In the most recent 3-year period (2000-2002), our patients experienced 57 cases of peritonitis and 24 cases of resistant peritonitis (42%). The organisms of peritonitis were alpha-streptococcus (46%), CNS, MSSA, Escherichia coli, and Candida species (38%). However, the organisms of resistant peritonitis were methicillin-resistant CNS (13%), Candida species (21%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa (13%), Serratia (13%), Citrobacter (13%), and Corynebacterium (13%). In the last several years, methicillin-resistant CNS has come to be main organism of resistant peritonitis. In addition, opportunistic infection has become a serious peritonitis problem. Given these data, we conclude that the incidence of resistant peritonitis is increasing and that the organisms of resistant peritonitis are changing.","410":"In the present study, we compared the influence of icodextrin (2 g\/dL) on uric acid (20 mg\/dL) and albumin (1 g\/dL) transfer through isolated rabbit parietal peritoneum. In separate series of experiments, we used a mathematical model to calculate the transport rate of solutes from the interstitial to the mesothelial side of peritoneal membrane (I --&gt; M) and in the opposite direction (M --&gt; I) before and after introduction of glucose polymer. In control conditions, the rates of uric acid and albumin passage across the rabbit peritoneum remained constant. Mean values [x +\/- standard error of the mean (SEM)] of the diffusive permeability coefficient P were 1.936 +\/- 0.324 (I --&gt; M) and 2.078 +\/- 0.186 (M --&gt; I) for uric acid and 0.341 +\/- 0.066 (I --&gt; M) and 0.389 +\/- 0.084 (M --&gt; I) for albumin (all x10(-4) cm\/s), respectively. The introduction of glucose polymer into the experimental system did not alter the I --&gt; M transport of either solute; but, in the opposite direction, it caused a 17% decline in the P for uric acid (p &lt; 0.05), and an increase of 77% in the same parameter for albumin (p &lt; 0.03). Hence, I --&gt; M transfer dominated M --&gt; I transfer of uric acid (p &lt; 0.04). In contrast, in albumin transport, M --&gt; I was higher than I --&gt; M (p &lt; 0.02). We conclude that, in vitro, icodextrin modifies the diffusive permeability of the peritoneum and induces transport asymmetry for some small and large solutes.","411":null,"412":"Aquaporin-1 (AQP1) has been reported to play an important role in water permeability in peritoneal dialysis. To determine the mechanism involved in this process, we used cultured rat peritoneal mesothelial cells (RPMCs) to examine the glucose-induced translocation of AQP1 to the plasma membrane. Cultured RPMCs obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats were incubated in a combination of Dulbecco modified Eagle medium (DMEM) and F12 medium at 37 degrees C for 15 minutes. The plasma membrane of the RPMCs was separated by Percoll gradient, and the quantity of AQP1 in the membrane fraction was determined by Western blot analysis. The amount of AQP1 was significantly increased by the addition of 5% glucose (139.5% +\/- 38.7% of control, p &lt; 0.05) or of dibutyryl cyclic adenosine monophosphate (db-cAMP), a cAMP analog to the medium (139.5% +\/- 21.9% of control, p &lt; 0.05). However glucose-induced enhancement of AQP1 disappeared with the addition of H-89, a protein kinase A (PKA)--specific inhibitor (103% +\/- 17.5% of control, p &lt; 0.05 as compared with 5% glucose). We also examined the effect of 5% glucose on PKA activity separately in the cytosol fraction, the crude membrane fraction, and the pure plasma membrane fraction. In the cytosol fraction of 5% glucose-stimulated RPMCs, PKA activity was decreased (70.5% +\/- 11.5% of control, p &lt; 0.01), but in the crude membrane fraction, it was significantly increased (143.9% +\/- 52.9% of control, p &lt; 0.01). In the pure plasma membrane fraction, PKA activity did not change. From those findings, we hypothesize that 5% glucose augments the PKA-dependent translocation of AQP1 to the plasma membrane, mediated by PKA translocation to the intracellular AQP1 store.","413":"Peritoneal fibrosis (PF) is one of the most serious causes of technique failure in long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD). Although the mechanisms responsible for the genesis of PF are not well understood, angiotensin II is known to promote fibrosis and inflammation in various tissues and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) have been shown to attenuate those effects. We previously showed that ACEIs have beneficial effects on peritoneal alterations induced by hypertonic (3.86% glucose) PD solutions. In the present study, we investigated the local effects of intraperitoneal (IP) enalapril on peritoneal alterations induced by 3.86% glucose PD solution in rats on chronic PD. One week after peritoneal catheter insertion, 23 non uremic male rats were randomly divided into two groups: group A (n = 11) received 20 mL 3.86% PD solution twice daily, and group B (n = 12) received 20 mL 3.86% PD solution containing 1 mg\/L enalapril twice daily. After 4 weeks of such infusions, we measured net ultrafiltration (UF) volume and obtained samples of visceral peritoneum from the liver for thickness measurement. Net UF was significantly higher (6.6 +\/- 0.2 mL vs. 5.6 +\/- 0.2 mL) and peritoneal thickness was significantly lower (30 +\/- 5 microm vs. 52 +\/- 0.8 microm) in group B. We conclude that intraperitoneal enalapril (an ACEI) protects the peritoneal membrane from the effects of hypertonic glucose. This protection might be mediated by enalapril's interference with angiotensin though inhibition of cytokine overexpression.","414":"Angiotensin II receptor blockers (ARBs) are effective in controlling blood pressure and have been shown to reduce proteinuria with fewer adverse effects than angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors. In the present prospective study, we evaluated the action of irbesartan, an ARB with a long half life, on proteinuria, peritoneal protein losses, and peritoneal transport in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). We enrolled 15 stable patients (11 with diuresis of more than 500 mL\/day; 40% women; 40% with diabetes) into the study. Mean age of the patients was 65 +\/- 15 years, and mean time on PD was 33 +\/- 21 months. The study was performed in two stages. In stage I, patients received no irbesartan. In stage II, patients received 30 days of treatment with irbesartan (145 +\/- 72 mg\/day). After treatment with irbesartan, and no changes in blood pressure level as compared with baseline, we observed a reduction in proteinuria (r = 0.690, p &lt; 0.05), decreased peritoneal protein losses at 4 hours' and 24 hours' dwell time (r = 0.910 and r = 0.930, p &lt; 0.001), decreased peritoneal Kt\/V(r = 0.586, p &lt; 0.05), and increased peritoneal creatinine clearance (r = 0.943, p &lt; 0.001). Levels of serum albumin (r = 0.630, p &lt; 0.05), prealbumin (r = 0.810, p &lt; 0.001), and transferrin (r = 0.551, p &lt; 0.05) increased after treatment with irbesartan. We conclude that treatment with irbesartan in patients with CRF undergoing PD modifies peritoneal transport and reduces peritoneal and urinary protein loss. This effect probably has a positive impact on nutritional parameters. Further studies are required to elucidate the mechanisms involved.","415":"The peritoneal mesothelium is a barrier to ion transport in peritoneal dialysis. In the present study, we investigated, by means of Ussing chamber experiments, the effect of adrenaline on the electrical transepithelial resistance (R(TE)) of isolated visceral sheep peritoneum. Peritoneal samples from the omentum of adult sheep were isolated within 30 minutes of the animal's death and were transferred to the laboratory in a cooled Krebs-Ringer bicarbonate solution (4 degrees C, pH 7.5) bubbled with 95% O2\/5% CO2. A visceral peritoneal planar sheet was mounted in an Ussing-type chamber and adrenaline (10(-7) mol\/L) was added to the apical and the basolateral side in turn. We measured R(TE) before and serially for 30 minutes after addition of the adrenaline. Because active ion transport is temperature-dependent, all experiments were performed at 37 degrees C. All results are presented as mean and standard error (x +\/- SE) of 6 experiments. The control R(TE0 (before adrenaline) was 20.05 +\/- 0.61 omega x cm2. Within 1 minute after the addition of adrenaline to the basolateral side of the membrane, R(TE) increased to 21.8 omega x cm2, a rate that thereafter progressively decayed, returning to the control value. Adrenaline action on the apical side of the membrane was similar, with a rapid rise of R(TE) to 22.5 omega x cm2 and a subsequent decrease (p &lt; 0.05). Previous studies provide evidence for a clear association between R(TE) and active ion transport. The results of the present study indicate rapid action of adrenaline on the permeability of the visceral peritoneum.","416":"The theoretical constructs of and limited clinical experiments with, continuous flow peritoneal dialysis (CFPD) are very promising. Specifically, removal of small molecular solutes has been shown to approximate that with quotidian hemodialysis. However progress has been slow because of the lack of an adequate peritoneal access device and the high cost of peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution generation. Several novel designs for CFPD catheters have been introduced during the past year. Those designs may solve some of the problems of fluid mixing and recirculation. This review of the past and latest developments in CFPD identifies the factors that limit the widespread use of this promising therapy.","417":"Peritoneal transport rates and net drained volume are reported to be different for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) as compared with patients without DM. The difference has been considered to be caused by exposure to high plasma glucose levels before PD initiation. However, the results of previous studies conflict. Transport of small solutes has been reported to be either higher than or similar to that seen in patients without DM, and ultrafiltration to be either similar or lower. No information on free water transport is available. The main problem in earlier reports is the wide variation in duration of PD, which may have influenced the outcomes. In the present study, we compared the results of peritoneal function tests in 10 patients with DM to results in 10 patients without DM. All patients were investigated within the first 4 months of PD treatment. No differences were observed in transcapillary ultrafiltration rate, net ultrafiltration, or lymphatic absorption. Free water transport, estimated using the maximum dip in the dialysate-to-plasma ratio of sodium and quantified by calculating the transport through the ultrasmall pores, showed no differences. Small-solute transport was also similar. These findings imply that a mild chronic hyperglycemic state in the peritoneal vessels does not contribute to important peritoneal changes or to changes in aquaporin-1 function. The influence of continuous treatment with hyperosmolar glucose solutions on the latter is worth investigating.","418":"Peritoneal hyperpermeability has been associated with increased levels of effluent vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) and interleukin-6 (IL-6). Mesothelial cells can produce various vasoactive substances besides VEGF. A large mesothelial mass may possibly lead to high dialysate VEGF concentrations and may partly explain some cases of peritoneal hyperpermeability during a patient's early months on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Early peritoneal fast transport may therefore not necessarily be associated with systemic inflammation. To investigate the relationship of effluent markers and peritoneal transport, we measured the appearance rates of cancer antigen 125 (CA125), VEGF, and IL-6 in 4-hour effluents from 69 peritoneal equilibration tests (PETs) using 3.86% glucose solution. At the same time, we measured serum VEGF and IL-6. Our analyses included an early group (EG), whose members had been on PD for 4.6 +\/- 3.3 months, and a later group (LG), whose members had been on PD for 30 +\/- 17 months. In EG, dialysate-to-plasma creatinine at 4 hours (D\/P(Cr240)) correlated significantly with effluent CA125\/min (r = 0.51, p = 0.006) and VEGF\/min (r = 0.57, p = 0.001), but not with serum VEGF or IL-6. The values of CA125\/min and VEGF\/min also correlated (r = 0.40, p = 0.034). Fast transporters in EG had higher effluent CA125 (p = 0.057) and VEGF (p = 0.0001), but not serum or effluent IL-6. In LG, D\/P(Cr240) again correlated significantly with dialysate VEGF (r = 0.51, p = 0.009), but not with CA125. Fast transporters in LG tended to have higher levels of serum and effluent IL-6 and effluent VEGF. We conclude that fast solute transport rates at the beginning of PD are associated with signs of a large mesothelial cell mass and not consistently associated with higher systemic IL-6. The VEGF produced by mesothelial cells can mediate early peritoneal hyperpermeability in some populations. Later, mesothelial mass is lost and is no longer related to increased intraperitoneal VEGF or IL-6.","419":"We investigated changes in peritoneal transport in patients treated at least 2 years with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The study included 28 patients (21 men, 7 women; CAPD duration: 24.0 - 28.3 months) who underwent peritoneal equilibration tests (PETs) at 3-month intervals for up to 24 months (group 24mPET). The PET results obtained at 24 months were compared to the results of the first PET taken in the same group (PET1, 0.03 - 15.86 months) and to the results of groups 1mPETand 6mPET. Group 1mPETconsisted of 41 patients--among them 14 patients (9 men, 5 women) from group 24mPET--who underwent a PET during the first month of CAPD. Group 6mPET consisted of 60 patients--among them 21 patients (15 men, 6 women) from group 24mPET--who underwent a PET at months 5 - 7 of CAPD. In analyzing paired data, we observed a significant reduction in vascular-to-mesothelial peritoneal transport (V --&gt; M PT) in the entire group and in men. In analyzing unpaired data, we observed a reduction in V --&gt; M PT between the 24mPET (n = 28) group and the 6mPET (n = 60) group [dialysate-to-plasma (D4\/P2) creatinine: 0.54 +\/- 0.18 vs. 0.65 +\/- 0.19, p = 0.013]. Distribution of low, low-average, high-average, and high transporters did not vary among the groups, except in the case of low creatinine transporters, who represented 47% of the 24mPET group and 23% of the 6mPET group (p = 0.046). We conclude that in patients (men) treated with CAPD at least 2 years, V --&gt; M PT decreases, increasing the percentage of low creatinine transporters and having no significant influence on dialysate drain volume. Peritoneal transport of glucose is stable over a 2-year period.","420":"","421":"Outcomes for pediatric peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are closely related to dialysis adequacy and nutrition, which need to be measured frequently using a number of laboratory parameters. Although the critical meaning of adequacy and nutrition in the long-term prognosis of dialyzed children is well-documented, PD prescriptions are still largely empirical. Our objective was to evaluate nutritional and dialytic parameters in PD children (urea, creatinine, and albumin excretion in dialysate and urine, and daily protein intake); to measure peritoneal equilibration test (PET) results, Kt\/V, normalized equivalent of protein nitrogen appearance (nPNA) and nitrogen balance; and to study the correlations between those variables. We performed 59 prospective laboratory measurements in 15 stable PD patients (7 boys; mean age: 6.7 years; age range: 1.1-14.8 years) during 6 months of follow-up. Creatinine, urea, total protein, and albumin were measured in plasma, urine, and dialysate. We calculated PET, Kt\/V, daily dietary protein intake (DPI), protein catabolic rate (PCR), and nPNA. All statistical comparisons used the paired t-test, and correlations were calculated by two-way analysis of variance for repeated measures. A value of p &lt; 0.05 was considered significant. The mean 4-hour dialysate-to-plasma ratio (D\/P) of creatinine was 0.78 +\/- 0.02 at month 0 and 0.74 +\/- 0.13 at month 6 [p = nonsignificant (NS)]. The mean final-dialysate-to-initial-dialysate ratio (D\/D0) of glucose was 0.35 +\/- 0.11 and 0.34 +\/- 0.08 at the same intervals (p = NS). The D\/P creatinine showed an inverse correlation with patient age and body surface area, and the D\/D0 glucose ratio showed a positive correlation with both of those parameters (p &lt; 0.05). Weekly total and residual Kt\/V urea were 3.41 +\/- 0.86 and 1.49 +\/- 1 respectively. The daily DPI was 3.32 +\/- 1.05 g\/kg, and the daily PCR was 1.32 +\/- 0.47 g\/kg, showing a positive net protein balance (DPI-PCR = +2 g\/kg daily), which was negatively correlated with age and body surface area (p &lt; 0.001). The mean daily nPNA was 0.94 +\/- 0.33 g\/kg, which was negatively correlated with age and body surface area (p &lt; 0.05, r = -0.51), and positively correlated with daily DPI and total and residual Kt\/V (p &lt; 0.0001). Our patients could be classified as high-average transporters, with low-average ultrafiltration. The high transport state was associated with greater peritoneal albumin losses, a point of concern at younger ages. Total Kt\/V and nPNA were higher for the youngest patients, suggesting a favorable nutrition status, but more studies are needed to determine the best value for both parameters in clinical practice.","422":"In this retrospective study, we evaluated the causative factors, outcomes, and complications of therapy in 35 patients (16 girls, 19 boys) started on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) between 1997 and 2002. Average age at initiation of CPD was 9.3 +\/- 4.4 years. All patients started on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Nine patients switched to ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (APD) during the follow-up period. The most common cause leading to end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in the patients was reflux nephropathy (22.9%). The major complication during therapy was peritonitis, with 41 episodes seen in 17 patients (1 episode per 18 patient-months). Of the children on APD, 7 developed 17 episodes of peritonitis (1 episode per 8.3 patient-months); of the children on CAPD, 10 developed 24 peritonitis attacks (1 episode per 24.9 patient-months). The other complications were inguinal hernia in 3 patients, subcutaneous leak in 4 patients, dialysate leak in 2 patients, pericardial effusion in 1 patient, umbilical hernia in 1 patient, hydrothorax in 1 patient, and cuff protrusion in 3 patients. During the follow-up period, 4 patients died owing to sepsis or cardiopulmonary complications. Only 1 patient was transferred to hemodialysis (owing to persistent Candida peritonitis). We think that CPD therapy is a good choice of treatment modality in the management of children with ESRD.","423":"Peritoneal dialysis prescription in children should be individualized--based not only on numerical targets (Kt\/Vurea, Kcreat), but also on consideration of the peritoneal membrane, a dynamic dialysis membrane. In fact, the effective peritoneal surface area is at least a triple entity: an anatomic area, a contact area, and an exchange area. The anatomic area appears to be twice as large in infants as in adults if expressed per kilogram of body weight (BW), although the area is independent of age if expressed per square meter of body surface area (BSA). Therefore, scaling of the intraperitoneal fill volume (IPV) by BSA in square meters is necessary to avoid a low IPV\/area ratio, which results in a functionally \"hyperpermeable\" peritoneal exchange. The contact area (the wetted membrane) is only a fraction of the anatomic area--that is, 30%-60% in humans (by computed tomography). Contact area depends on a variety of factors, such as posture and fill volume, that affect the degree of recruitment of membrane contact area. The exchange area is influenced by both the anatomic are and the contact area. However, it is mainly governed by the specific vascular area as determined by the peritoneal vascular perfusion and the capillaries available for exchange. Vascular area is dynamically affected by a variety of factors, such as the composition of the peritoneal dialysis fluid, the fill volume, and possible inflammatory agents.","424":"Recurrent and persistent peritonitis episodes are exhausting problems in children on chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) and can lead to discontinuation of treatment. In the present report, we describe our clinical experience with endoluminal brushing (EB) in 3 pediatric patients with refractory peritonitis episodes maintained on chronic PD. The EB was performed on 4 occasions in 3 patients. Peritonitis resolved in 2 of the patients. The remaining patient required removal of the PD catheter. No adverse events have since been observed. Endoluminal brushing should be considered an option for the management of persistent peritonitis before catheter removal.","425":"Since the introduction of Y-connector technology and the subsequent reduction in the frequency of peritonitis, catheter-related infections have become the primary infectious complication in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Such infections may lead to prolonged morbidity, recurrent peritonitis, and catheter failure. Despite appropriate treatment of catheter-related infections, removal of the catheter is sometimes necessary. The timing of catheter removal and replacement has been the focus of significant discussion. The International Society for Peritoneal Dialysis recommends a 3-week interval, but also allows for individualized timing. Long staging periods present problems that simultaneous removal and replacement (SRR) of the catheter may obviate. Here, we review a body of literature on SRR and present guidelines as to when SRR of an infected PD catheter may be considered a safe alternative to a staged procedure.","426":"Many studies have examined the survival of the first peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter. However, data are scarce about the factors that influence the function and survival time of a second PD catheter. The purpose of the present study was to calculate the survival time of the second PD catheter and to examine factors that predict removal of that catheter. We conducted a retrospective study of second PD catheters inserted at our institution over a 10-year period from May 1992 to April 2002. The endpoint consisted of removal of the second catheter. Voluntary change to hemodialysis, kidney transplantation, transfer to another center, and death with a functioning catheter were censored observations. Catheter survival was analyzed by the Kaplan-Meier method. During the study period, 106 patients (59 men, 47 women) received a second catheter. The mean age of the patients was 55 +\/- 14.9 years. One third of the patients had diabetes. The reasons for removal of the first catheter and insertion of the second one were peritonitis (n = 50), catheter malfunction (n = 20), catheter leak (n = 11), exit site or tunnel infection (n = 21), and failed kidney transplantation with resumption of PD (n = 4). The median survival of the second catheter was 48 months (95% confidence interval: 38 months to 59 months). On univariate analysis, increasing patient age and peritonitis as cause for removal of the first catheter were associated with an increased risk of removal of the second catheter. However, on multivariate analysis, only increasing patient age was associated with a greater risk to survival of the second catheter.","427":"The aim of the present study was to establish a relationship between serum haptoglobin (HTG) concentration, peritoneal dialysis (PD) adequacy, and nutrition status in PD patients with and without diabetes. We measured serum concentrations of HTG, albumin, iron, and cholesterol; platelet count; transferrin saturation (TSAT); weekly Kt\/V; and total weekly creatinine clearance (CCr) in 60 patients with and without diabetes who were being treated with continuous ambulatory PD or automated PD. The mean serum HTG concentration in PD patients without diabetes (2.5 +\/- 1.2 g\/L) was elevated and differed significantly from that in PD patients with diabetes (2.0 +\/- 1.1 g\/L). In patients without diabetes the correlation of serum HTG concentration with serum albumin level was r = -0.330 (p &lt; 0.030), with platelet count was r = 0.320 (p &lt; 0.040), with serum iron concentration was r = -0.450 (p &lt; 0.002), with TSAT was r = -0.4200 (p &lt; 0.005), and with age was r = 0.337 (p = 0.003). No such relationships were seen in patients with diabetes. In both subgroups, no dependence was seen between serum HTG concentration and weekly Kt\/V, total weekly CCr, or serum cholesterol concentration. Serum HTG concentration in PD patients without diabetes may be a valid inflammatory marker. The HTG serum level displays a significant statistical dependence on age, platelet count, and markers of nutrition such as serum albumin level, iron, and TSAT. It does not depend on markers of dialysis adequacy (weekly Kt\/V, total weekly CCr) or on serum cholesterol concentration. The serum HTG concentration in PD patients with diabetes is lower than that in patients without diabetes, and it is not related to examined factors of inflammation, nutrition, or adequacy of dialysis.","428":"Endothelial dysfunction with atherosclerosis is a recognized complication of uremic patients. The hypoalbuminemia of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients can induce a hypercoagulable and atherogenic state. In this study, we investigated the role played by malnutrition-inflammation syndrome on endothelial function markers in PD patients. We measured markers of nutrition [normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR), albumin, prealbumin, insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1), transferrin, and cholesterol], markers of endothelial damage and function [tissue-type plasminogen activator (tPA), thrombomodulin (TM), von Willebrand factor (vWF), and NO3 (representing NO)], markers of a coagulable state [fibrinogen and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1)], markers of inflammation [tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) and C-reactive protein (CRP)], and other endothelial injury factors [lipoprotein(a) [Lp(a)] and homocysteine]. We also performed an endothelial stimulation test consisting of right-arm venous occlusion (VO) for 10 minutes. The patients were divided into four groups according to their clinical atherosclerotic score (CAS). We studied 45 clinically stable PD patients. At baseline, statistically significant negative linear correlations were found between albumin and age (r = -0.54, p &lt; 0.05), albumin and vWF post-VO (r = -0.54, p &lt; 0.05), and albumin and TM (r = -0.36, p &lt; 0.05), which are endothelial damage markers and prothrombotic factors. A positive linear correlation was seen between albumin and NO3 post-VO (r = 0.48, p &lt; 0.05), indicating a high vasodilatation capacity. C-Reactive protein and TNF alpha showed a positive linear correlation (r = 0.5, p &lt; 0.01). Similarly, TNF alpha showed a positive linear correlation with cardiovascular risk markers such as fibrinogen (r = 0.79, p &lt; 0.01), PAI-1 (r = 0.44, p &lt; 0.05), and homocysteine (r = 0.37, p &lt; 0.05). Creatinine clearance showed a negative linear correlation with TM (r = -0.36, p &lt; 0.05). Patients with albumin &lt; 4 g\/dL showed a lower tPA ratio, lower NO3, and a higher CRP, TNF alpha, and Lp(a) than did patients with albumin &gt; 4 g\/dL [tPA ratio: 2.1 +\/- 1.56 (n = 29) vs. 2.6 +\/- 2.3 (n = 16), p &lt; 0.05; NO3: 47 +\/- 27 micrograms\/mL vs. 69 +\/- 33 micrograms\/mL, p &lt; 0.05; CRP: 1.8 +\/- 3 mg\/dL vs. 1.1 +\/- 1.6 mg\/dL, p &lt; 0.05; TNF alpha: 44.4 +\/- 16 pg\/mL vs. 36.6 +\/- 21.4 pg\/mL, p &lt; 0.05; Lp(a): 55 +\/- 39 mg\/dL vs. 33 +\/- 21 mg\/dL, p &lt; 0.05]. Patients with a worse CAS showed higher homocysteine levels and lower albumin values. Those relationships were maintained in both periods of the study. We found no relationships between dialysis dose and endothelial function markers. In conclusion, malnutrition-inflammation syndrome may contribute to endothelial dysfunction and, consequently, to prothrombotic and proatherogenic processes in PD patients.","429":"The rate of technique failure is still high in Japan for peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Of the dropouts who have been treated with PD for more than 6 years, about half suffer from ultrafiltration failure. That condition is supposedly related to the bioincompatible aspects of conventional acidic PD solutions. In 2001, a neutral-pH, lactate-buffered PD solution with low glucose degradation products (GDPs), Midpeliq (Terumo Corporation, Tokyo, Japan), was developed and began to be used in Japan. After switching 3 patients from conventional acidic PD solution to Midpeliq, we observed that 2 patients could then use lower-glucose PD solutions. Case 1 was a 42-year-old woman with a 10-year history of PD. In February 2001, she was switched from Peritoliq (Terumo) to Midpeliq. One month later, she complained of dizziness, and her blood pressure was found to be down to 96\/60 mmHg. Post-change fluid removal increased to 1,481 mL from 1,238 mL (p &lt; 0.02). Before the solution switch, this patient exchanged 4 times daily, using 2 L of 2.5% Peritoliq each time. From 3 months after the solution switch, she exchanged 3 times daily using 2 L of 2.5% Midpeliq and 1 time daily using 2 L of 1.35% Midpeliq. Fluid volume removal stayed almost the same. Case 2 was a 52-year-old man with a 9-year history of PD. In June 2002, he was switched from Dianeal 4 (Baxter Healthcare, Tokyo, Japan) to Midpeliq. After the change, his daily drainage volume increased from approximately 1,500 mL to 2,000 mL. He began to use 2 L of 1.35% Midpeliq 4 times daily instead of 2 L of 1.5% Dianeal 3 times daily and 2 L of 2.5% Dianeal 1 time daily. At 1 month after the solution switch, his drainage volume was still approximately 1,500 mL daily. Our observations suggest that new, neutral-pH PD solutions such as Midpeliq might reduce the glucose load in addition to having low GDPs and fewer toxic effects on the peritoneum.","430":"Paricalcitol [Zemplar: Abbott Laboratories, Abbott Park, IL, U.S.A.] is efficient for treating secondary hyperparathyroidism in patients on maintenance hemodialysis (HD). Zemplar is thought to be more potent than calcitriol and has been reported to cause less hypercalcemia and hyperphosphatemia. Here, we report a 1-year follow-up on patients from one inner-city dialysis unit. We reviewed the charts of 100 patients and collected data for 1 year. Patients were stratified into four groups depending upon their intact parathormone (iPTH) levels. Hemoglobin (Hb) and erythropoietin (EPO) doses were determined. More than 50% of patients had iPTH levels greater than 300 pg\/mL. Mean Ca and PO4 levels were not significantly different, but Zemplar doses were significantly different in all groups. None of the patients had symptomatic bone disease. Seven patients were changed to low-Ca dialysate (1.0 mEq\/L) secondary to hypercalcemia (Ca &gt; 11.5 mg\/dL) and severe secondary hyperparathyroidism. Interestingly, patients with low iPTH (&lt; 100 pg\/microL) showed relative EPO resistance, and patients with high iPTH (&gt; 600 pg\/microL) required smaller EPO doses. An inverse relationship was observed between Zemplar and EPO dose. The effect of Zemplar on EPO responsiveness needs to be confirmed in a larger study. Our data suggest that severe secondary hyperparathyroidism is frequent despite aggressive paricalcitol therapy in our inner-city HD population. To control severe secondary hyperparathyroidism in these patients, dietary and medication compliance may need to be supplemented with more effective non-calcium phosphate binders or calcimimetic agents, or both.","431":"Secondary hyperparathyroidism is a major complication in uremic patients undergoing dialysis. Various active metabolites of vitamin D are used as oral treatment; however, in some patients, parathyroid hormone (PTH) is not ideally suppressed. Intravenous injection of an active form of vitamin D inhibits PTH more effectively than does oral administration. However, intravenous administration is often restricted by the complication of hypercalcemia. In the calcitriol analog 22-oxacalcitriol (OCT), the 22nd carbon atom is replaced by oxygen. The OCT analog has been reported to have a lesser hypercalcemic effect than does calcitriol. The present study was planned to determine whether intraperitoneal administration of OCT would be a more effective treatment of secondary hyperparathyroidism than intravenous administration is in CAPD patients who manage themselves at home. The results showed that OCT is stable in dialysis solution and that its intraperitoneal administration was effective for suppressing PTH in patients with secondary hyperparathyroidism.","432":"The aim of the present study was to compare parameters of dietary intake, nutritional status, dialysis adequacy, and laboratory data between continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients having a normal body mass index (BMI) and those having an increased BMI. Two groups were selected: BMI = 20-25 (group I, n = 29) and BMI = 25-30 (group II, n = 19). No difference in age or peritoneal dialysis duration were observed between the study groups. Among parameters of dietary intake, only vitamin C ingestion was higher in group II than in group I. As compared with the patients in group I, the patients in group II showed significantly higher total body mass, lean body mass, fat body mass, and total body water. The Kt\/V was lower in group II than in group I. In group II, values of serum iron concentration and transferrin saturation were both lower than those seen in group I. No differences were observed between the study groups for the other examined parameters. Those results show that overweight CAPD patients have higher anthropometric parameters and a lower Kt\/V owing to a higher urea distribution volume. Disorders in iron parameters are more frequent in overweight patients. The observed differences do not influence duration of peritoneal dialysis treatment.","433":"We tested the agreement between classifications of the weight status of patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) by body mass index (BMI) and by body fat (BF) content (BF\/W, where W = actual weight), when BF was computed as BF = W - V\/0.73 from the Sahlgrenska, Watson, or Hume anthropometric formulas estimating body water (V) in 933 patients on PD and 7,737 outpatients without hydration disorders. We used currently accepted cut-off values for classifying subjects as underweight, normal-weight, overweight, and obese by BMI and BF\/W. We obtained these values: BMI: men on PD (n = 555), 25.5 +\/- 4.3; men with normal renal function [NRF (n = 5,906)], 27.7 +\/- 5.1; women on PD (n = 378), 25.9 +\/- 6.1; women with NRF (n = 1,831), 28.3 +\/- 6.5; BFSahlgrenska\/W--men on PD, 0.238 +\/- 0.063; men with NRF, 0.274 +\/- 0.052; women on PD, 0.342 +\/- 0.89; women with NRF, 0.366 +\/- 0.075. We obtained these regressions: Women on PD BMI = 12.0832 + 38.9550 (BFSahlgrenska\/W) -92.9252 (BFSahlgrenska\/W)2 +254.0675 (BFSahlgrenska\/W)3, r2 = 0.917; Men on PD BMI = 19.4729 - 29.1310 (BFSahlgrenska\/W) +213.7045 (BFSahlgrenska\/W)2, r2 = 0.888. From those regressions, the BMI value corresponding to the BFSahlgrenska\/W cut-off for underweight was similar to the National Institutes of Health (NIH) BMI cut-off for underweight. The BMI value corresponding to the BFSahlgrenska\/W cut-off for obesity was substantially lower than the NIH BMI cut-off for obesity. The kappa ratios of the classifications of weight status by BMI and BFSahlgrenska\/W varied between 0.142 and 0.304 (poor agreement), with more than 50% of the subjects classified in a more obese weight category by BFSahlgrenska\/W than by BMI. Classification of the subjects by BMI and by BFSahlgrenska\/W in quintiles or quartiles led to much higher kappa ratios, particularly in women. The results were similar in subjects with NRF and with the use of the Watson and Hume formulas to estimate BF. The use of arbitrary cut-off values of BMI or anthropometric BF\/W to classify PD patients or patients without edematous states as underweight, normal-weight, overweight, or obese leads to substantial disagreement between the two classifications. Classification of weight status by BMI or BF\/W in quintiles or quartiles improves substantially the agreement between the two classifications and should be preferred.","434":"In adult patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), estimates of body water (V), fat-free mass (FFM), and body fat (BF) can be obtained by using anthropometric formulas for estimating V. Estimates of V, FFM, and BF can also be obtained by using reference (standard) methods in which V is evaluated by a standard dilution method. To test whether the estimates obtained by the various methods agree, we analyzed published studies that measured V by a standard method in adult PD patients. We then calculated V, FFM, and BF by the Watson, Hume, Sahlgrenska, Chumlea, Lee, and Chertow formulas for the \"average subject\" in the published studies. We compared the standard and the anthropometric estimates using the limits-of-agreement method of Bland and Altman. Our analysis included six studies involving a total of 262 patients (89 women, 173 men). The six studies measured V by a reference method and allowed calculation of anthropometric V, FFM, and BF for the average patient. We calculated these values: VStandard, 36.8 +\/- 4.7 L; VSahlgrenska, 36.9 +\/- 4.3 L [p = nonsignificant (NS); Bland-Altman limits of agreement: -3.1 L to 3.3 L]; FFMStandard 50.9 +\/- 5.2 kg; FFMSahlgrenska, 50.6 +\/- 4.3 kg (Bland-Altman limits of agreement: -5.4 kg to 4.8 kg); BFStandard, 20.3 +\/- 3.0 kg; BFSahlgrenska, 20.6 +\/- 2.3 kg (Bland-Altman limits of agreement: -4.8 kg to 5.4 kg). Results obtained using the Watson, Hume, Chumlea, and Lee formulas also agreed with the standard estimates. The Chertow formula produced results that systematically overestimated the standard V and FFM values and that underestimated the standard BF. The Watson, Hume, Sahlgrenska, Chumlea, and Lee anthropometric formulas used to calculate V provide estimates of body composition that approximate those obtained using standard methods in PD patients with average body composition. Anthropometric estimates may cause large systematic errors in PD patients whose body composition varies from the average, particularly obese or overhydrated patients.","435":"Protein nitrogen appearance (PNA) estimated from urea nitrogen appearance (UNA) reflects dietary protein intake and is an important index of nutrition in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Normalization of PNA by several body size indicators has resulted in discrepancies between normalized PNA (nPNA) values and other nutrition indices in PD patients with varying weight status. To test whether a particular size indicator produces nPNA values that eliminate the discrepancies, we normalized PNA values obtained at the first clearance study in 925 PD patients by weight (W), by fat-free mass (FFM) obtained from body water, by lean body mass (LBM) derived from creatinine kinetics, by desirable weight (DW), by standard weight (SW), and by adjusted edema-fee body weight (aBW). We classified patients into three groups according to W\/DW: an underweight group [group I: W\/DW &lt; 0.9, n = 147 (15.9%)], a normal-weight group [group II: 0.9 &lt; or = W\/DW &lt; 1.2, n = 506 (54.7%)], and an obese group [group III: W\/DW &gt; or = 1.2, n = 272 (29.4%)]. The UNA and PNA increased progressively from group I to group III. The W, FFM, LBM, SW, and aBW also increased progressively, and the corresponding nPNA values decreased progressively from group I to group III--all at p &lt; 0.001. The DW did not differ significantly between the three groups. The PNA values normalized by DW were 0.91 +\/- 0.21 (group I), 0.96 +\/- 0.24 (group II), and 1.07 +\/- 0.25 (group III), p &lt; 0.001. Of the six size indicators tested, only DW produced values of nPNA consistent with the nutrition status of PD patients with varying weight status. Our findings indicate that DW is the proper size indicator for normalizing PNA in PD patients.","436":"Despite recent advances in peritoneal dialysis (PD) systems, peritonitis is a significant clinical problem in patients on PD. Risk factors for peritonitis are identifiable and modifiable and require focused intervention. During a baseline period in 1998, we observed consistent differences in peritonitis rates among patients using various PD connection systems. In January 1999, motivated by a need to reduce peritonitis, we initiated a multifaceted continuous quality initiative (CQI) program that included retraining all current patients and all new patients 6 months after initiation and then annually; changing from plastic to titanium adapters between the catheter and the transfer set; and using equipment from a single PD manufacturer for all new patients and for current patients with high peritonitis rates. Furthermore, all patients using HomeChoice cyclers (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, McGaw Park, IL, U.S.A.) were taught to use the Compact Exchange Device II to avoid contamination when spiking solution bags. Peritonitis rates improved from 1 episode per 7.5 patient-months (over 512 patient-months) in 1998 to 1 episode per 36.5 patient-months (over 292 patient-months) as of September 2002. Further analysis also showed a significant difference in peritonitis rates between equipment produced by various manufacturers. There was a statistically significant difference in peritonitis for automated peritoneal dialysis systems. Patients using the Freedom Cycler PD+ (Fresenius Medical Care, Frankfurt, Germany) had an average peritonitis rate of 1 episode per 6.9 patient-months as compared with patients using the HomeChoice cycler (Baxter Healthcare), who experienced 1 episode of peritonitis per 23.9 patient-months on average (p &lt; 0.0001). For continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients using UltraBag (Baxter Healthcare), the peritonitis rate was 1 episode per 26 patient-months as compared with the Premier Double Bag (Fresenius Medical Care), for which a peritonitis rate of 1 episode per 6.3 patient-months was seen (p &lt; 0.0001). Comparison of the UltraBag (1 episode per 26.0 patient-months) with the Disposable Freedom Set, a single-bag \"Y\" system (Fresenius Medical Care; 1 episode per 7.5 patient-months) yielded similar results (p &lt; 0.0001). We conclude that ongoing CQI efforts can significantly reduce peritonitis rates. Our efforts included aggressive patient retraining, protocol changes, use of a titanium adapter between the catheter and the transfer set, and careful choice of connectology systems (possible supplier-dependent effect).","437":"Application of mupirocin to the nares or catheter exit site and frequency of mupirocin administration in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients remain controversial. The objective of our study was to evaluate, using a historical control group, the efficacy on CAPD-related infections of once-weekly application of mupirocin at the catheter exit site. We instructed 18 CAPD patients, who did not initially use prophylactic antibiotic treatment, about once-weekly application of mupirocin ointment to the exit site as part of their exit-site care. We recorded the incidence of catheter-related infections, the causative micro-organisms, and the rate of catheter loss. We observed 17 acute exit-site infections (AESIs: 0.45 episodes\/patient-year) before mupirocin treatment and 2 AESIs (0.06 episodes\/patient-year) after treatment. The relative rate of AESI reduction was 86%. Before application of mupirocin, 52% of AESIs were attributable to Staphylococcus-aureus; after mupirocin administration, no AESIs were staphylococcal. Peritonitis episodes were also reduced from 21 before mupirocin treatment (0.56 episodes\/patient-year), to 9 after mupirocin administration (0.29 episodes\/patient-year). The relative rate of peritonitis reduction was 48%. Once-weekly application of mupirocin to the exit site resulted in a reduction in exit-site infections and peritonitis episodes comparable to those obtained with daily application.","438":"Bacteria from the exit site of the peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter and from contaminated dialysis fluids can grow into microcolonies in biofilm. Those bacteria are implicated in recurrent peritonitis in patients undergoing treatment with PD. The present article highlights new strategies that are designed to alter the major factors regulating biofilm formation and that thereby reduce biofilm-related infections in PD patients.","439":"Icodextrin is a glucose polymer obtained from starch hydrolysis. It is used as an osmotic agent at 7.5% for peritoneal dialysis (PD). Its use in PD has been associated with several side effects separate from the one reported here, the most frequent being sterile peritonitis. Recently, three mechanisms have been proposed to explain the occurrence of sterile peritonitis: allergy to dextrin, production of anti-dextran antibodies, and impurities introduced during manufacture. Here, we report a peritoneal mononucleosis outbreak that is highly suggestive of being a consequence of the last-mentioned mechanism. During the period December 2001 to May 2002, a group of 8 Spanish hospitals whose individual PD programs regularly share information and activity reported 29 cases of sterile peritonitis associated with icodextrin use in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients [mean age: 60.7 +\/- 14.47 years; 8 women (27.59%), 21 men (72.41%); mean time on PD: 25.21 +\/- 35.31 months; mean time on icodextrin: 15.17 +\/- 11.03 months]. Of the 29 patients, 51.8% showed no symptoms. The remainder presented with mild abdominal discomfort and anorexia. Only 2 patients showed general malaise, severe nausea, fever, and abdominal pain. The initial white cell count in peritoneal effluent was 512 +\/- 386 cells\/mL (45.0% +\/- 28% neutrophils, 44.92% +\/- 32.6% mono-nuclear cells, 7.75% +\/- 12% eosinophils). In 5 of the patients, we performed an immunophenotype (CD14) study, demonstrating the monocyte nature of 60%-80% (mean: 70.6%) of the cells. Microbiology cultures were always negative. A rechallenge with the same batches of PD fluid was tried. In 100% of the patients, the clinical and cellular patterns relapsed. No short-term changes in peritoneal function have been observed. The manufacturer informed us that the icodextrin was contaminated with a peptidoglycan. In this sterile peritonitis outbreak with a simultaneous, similar clinical presentation in a group of patients treated with icodextrin solution (presumably contaminated with peptidoglycan), clinical outcome was, for the most part, mild-to-moderate. Symptoms disappeared immediately after icodextrin withdrawal and relapsed after rechallenge with the relevant fluid batches. Monocyte cell counts predominated during the episode. Although we cannot rule out an allergic cause, the massive peritoneal mononuclear cell recruitment suggests a particular mechanism. This is a new mechanism for peritoneal cell recruitment in PD.","440":"Chronic exposure to peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions is associated with a low-grade local inflammatory state of the peritoneum. The occurrence of culture-negative peritonitis in some PD patients treated with icodextrin focused our interest on subclinical inflammation in icodextrin-treated patients without peritonitis. The aim of the present study was to compare signs of inflammation in icodextrin-treated patients with the same signs in patients using glucose\/lactate-based (GL) dialysis solutions only. Overnight PD effluents from 19 patients treated with icodextrin and 19 patients treated with GL were investigated for leukocyte count (LC) and differentiation (LD), and for dialysate concentrations of cancer antigen 125 (CA125, the marker of mesothelial cell mass) and hyaluronan (marker of inflammation and tissue remodeling in the peritoneal cavity). Blood cell counts and serum dextran antibodies (DA) were also determined. Total LC in the GL group was significantly lower than that in the icodextrin group. The LD was not different between the two groups, except for the percentage of eosinophils. The blood cell count did not differ between the groups. The median value of DA was similar in both groups. The hyaluronan concentration was markedly higher in the icodextrin group. No significant difference was found for dialysate CA125. In conclusion, the higher effluent cell count, higher percentage of eosinophils, and higher effluent hyaluronan levels in icodextrin-treated patients are consistent with a greater degree of subclinical inflammation during icodextrin treatment than during GL treatment.","441":"To investigate the role of adhesion molecules [intracellular adhesion molecule 1 (ICAM-1), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1), and integrin alpha 5 beta 1] in the progression of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) under peritoneal dialysis, we examined changes in the expression of those adhesion molecules in Wistar-Kyoto (WKY) rats treated with acidic dialysis solution with or without angiotensin II type 1a receptor blocker (ARB). We divided 48 WKY rats into 4 groups and dialyzed them with various solutions as follows: (1) pH 7 1.5% glucose dialysis solution (control group, n = 12); (2) pH 3.5 1.5% glucose dialysis solution (EPS group, n = 12); (3) pH 3.5 1.5% glucose dialysis solution, plus oral administration of CS866 5 mg\/kg daily (ARB group, n = 12); and (4) pH 3.5 1.5% glucose dialysis solution, plus oral administration of amlodipine (CA group, n = 12). We injected the dialysis solutions into the abdominal cavity and administered the ARB and CA daily for 42 days. On days 3, 7, 14, and 42, three rats in each group were humanely killed by decapitation, and we studied the expression of adhesion molecules in peritoneum by the immunofluorescence method. In the EPS rats, expression of adhesion molecules was observed in peritoneum on day 3 after start of acidic solution treatment, in conjunction with an increment of interleukin 6 (IL-6) in the dialysate. The peritoneum of EPS rats showed peritoneal fibrosis with interstitial cell infiltration. Treatment with ARB significantly suppressed expression of adhesion molecules in the peritoneum and suppressed peritoneal fibrosis. Treatment with a neutral solution induced no peritoneal fibrosis nor expression of adhesion molecules in the peritoneum. Our results suggest that adhesion molecules play an important role in the progression of peritoneal fibrosis and resultant EPS. Treatment with ARB prevents the progression of peritoneal fibrosis and suppresses expression of adhesion molecules in the peritoneum.","442":"Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is recognized as a serious complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Involvement of inflammation is indispensable as a cause of EPS. Here, we present a case of EPS that occurred in a 46-year-old man with alcoholic liver cirrhosis and ascites who was treated solely by hemodialysis (HD). We managed this patient surgically, with total intestinal enterolysis. Thick capsules had formed surrounding the ascites. Capsules had also covered the parietal peritoneum and intestinal surface and compressed the intestine. Examination of the ascites suggested the involvement of inflammation and the coagulation-fibrinolysis system. Inflammation of a deteriorated peritoneum causes EPS, resulting in encapsulation subsequent to an accumulation of inflammatory products such as fibrin. Even without deterioration of the peritoneum, chronic inflammation and continual irritation caused EPS-like findings with encapsulation.","443":"To establish histologic criteria for a diagnosis of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS), we investigated 69 peritoneal biopsy specimens histologically and immunohistochemically. The specimens included cases of EPS (n = 12), suspected cases of EPS without later manifestation (n = 5), cases of infectious peritonitis (n = 20), cases of ultrafiltration failure (n = 25), and peritoneum at the start of peritoneal dialysis (n = 7). For each specimen, we evaluated these histologic parameters: fibrin deposition, mesothelial denudation, interstitial fibrosis, peritoneal fibroblast swelling, perivascular bleeding capillary angiogenesis, microvascular sclerosis, and interstitial mononuclear cell infiltration. We also evaluated these immunohistochemical markers: macrophage migration inhibitory factor (MIF), fibroblast growth factor (FGF), FGF receptor 2 (FGFR2), alpha smooth muscle actin (alpha SMA), MIB1, and BCL2. The most characteristic histologic findings for EPS were fibrin deposition and fibroblast swelling. The presence of capillary angiogenesis and mononuclear cell infiltration were also associated with EPS. Expression of FGF, FGFR2, MIF, MIB1, and BCL2 in peritoneal fibroblasts was frequently observed in EPS. Our results suggest that fibrin deposition and peritoneal fibroblast activation or proliferation (or both) are useful findings for the early diagnosis of EPS. Careful histologic observation of the peritoneal biopsy after withdrawal of peritoneal dialysis is required for the early diagnosis and prevention of EPS.","444":"Despite overwhelming evidence of enhanced survival and quality of life among end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated with home hemodialysis (HHD) and home peritoneal dialysis (PD), use of those two modalities is decreasing. Our analysis of data obtained over the past 6 years reveals that, at the same time as the national ESRD population has grown by more than 33%, the fraction of those patients on home dialysis has decreased by 36%. Similar trends are observable in the State of Texas. At our institution, the percentage of ESRD patients receiving home dialysis dropped by 52% in 6 years. Our capture rate during the same interval ranged from 1% to 9% (mean +\/- standard deviation: 3.66% +\/- 2.64%). To improve the capture rate and to strengthen our home dialysis program, we adopted these measures: Nephrologists participated in dialysis education and explained renal replacement therapy (RRT) options to each patient and to accompanying family members. The home dialysis coordinator later met with the patients individually. The new patients were then encouraged to meet with patients already enrolled in the home dialysis program. Finally, patients choosing home dialysis were given a questionnaire to rank their reasons for selecting that modality. From April 2001 to July 2002, we initiated 136 patients onto dialysis. Of those patients, 118 selected in-center hemodialysis and 18 chose home dialysis, representing a capture rate of 13% and resultant growth of 117% in our home dialysis program. Our survey revealed that the prime reason for selection of home dialysis was independence (31%), followed by physician guidance, coordinator education, and work schedule (17% each). Familial assistance, familial employment, and privacy were less important (7%, 7%, and 3% respectively). We conclude that, by devoting more time to patient education and discussion of RRTs, nephrologists and dialysis coordinators can significantly increase home dialysis enrollment.","445":"Recent studies have suggested a relationship between depression--as assessed by the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)--and mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. A recent study from the Dialysis Outcomes and Practice Patterns Study (DOPPS) indicated an association between mortality in a large cohort of hemodialysis patients and the patients' responses in the preceding 4 weeks to two questions on the Kidney Disease Quality of Life, Short Form (KDQOL-SF36): \"Have you felt downhearted and blue?\" and \"Have you felt so down in the dumps that nothing could cheer you?\" A BDI score &gt; or = 11 and a score &lt; or = 3 for the two questions on the SF36 were considered to suggest the presence of depressive symptoms; both scores have been associated with increased mortality in hemodialysis patients. We aimed to examine the relationship of the two SF36 questions with depressive symptoms as assessed by the BDI. All patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) therapy and daily hemodialysis therapy in our units between June 2000 and January 2002 were asked to complete a BDI and an SF36. We recorded 135 tests in 80 CPD patients, and 76 tests in 17 daily hemodialysis patients. Correlation coefficients (r2 values) of the responses to the two questions on the SF36 and the BDI scores demonstrated a significant relationship between the scores. The r2 values for the CPD patients' two SF36 responses and the BDI scores were -0.622 and -0.506; the r2 values for the daily hemodialysis patients were -0.363 and -0.317. The sensitivity and specificity for each SF36 response to be &lt; or = 3 when the BDI was &gt; or = 11 were 82.4% and 68.6% for the \"downhearted and blue\" question and 65% and 67% for the \"down in the dumps\" question. Whether the two questions on the SF36 that suggest depression can replace the BDI as a screening tool requires further study. Furthermore, it is unclear if the two questions on the SF36 are predictive of mortality because of their association with clinical depression or because of other issues.","446":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is an effective renal replacement therapy; however, its penetration rate in China is rather low. In the present study, we investigated the opinions and attitudes of Chinese chief nephrologists about dialysis modality selection. We asked 51 chief nephrologists from various university hospitals to answer 8 questions about their attitudes toward PD and about the factors that affect their selection of dialysis modality. Hemodialysis (HD) was available in all of the hospitals where the surveyed chief nephrologists worked. Peritoneal dialysis was available in 68.6% of the hospitals, and renal transplantation was available in 54.9%. Of the surveyed nephrologists, 5.9% believed that PD was more advantageous than HD, and 29.4% of them believed that HD was better. However, most of the nephrologists (64.7%) thought that the advantages of each modality depended on the individual patient and therefore that modality selection should be individualized accordingly. About 70.6% of the nephrologists expressed confidence in PD, and 88% were interested in PD. Overall, 90.2% of the nephrologists said that they would start or expand a PD program in the future. More than half of the nephrologists (52.9%) thought that the proportion of PD in China should be 30%-50%. [The actual percentage is less than 10% in most ares (58.8%) of China.] Most nephrologists indicated that the major reasons for such low use of PD were the low profit from PD treatment and insufficient patient and professional education about PD. A few nephrologists said that peritonitis, the high PD dropout rate, and patient preference also affected the penetration of PD. Our findings suggest that many of the chief nephrologists in China are confident about PD treatment. The major obstacles to PD expansion in China are the lack of incentive (profit) for PD treatment and insufficient education for professionals and patients alike.","447":"The influence that the mode of dialysis has on the prognosis of patients with renal disease is controversial. The controversy arises at least in part because of the heterogeneity of patient populations, who may be receiving either continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or hemodialysis (HD). In the absence of randomized trials, epidemiologic investigations present the best method for studying the problem. To determine the influence of the mode of dialysis on prognosis and on the cardiovascular system, erythropoiesis, and calcium metabolism, we selected 36 patients undergoing CAPD and 36 patients undergoing HD for a 3-year follow-up study. Patients were matched for age, sex, and cause of renal disease. Among the HD patients, 8 deaths occurred from congestive heart failure, 1 death from cerebrovascular accident, and 2 deaths from severe infection. In the HD group, the average age was 63 +\/- 3 years. Among the CAPD patients, 6 were transferred to HD because of recurrent peritonitis or elevation of serum creatinine. Patients on CAPD had lower blood pressures, and patients on HD had lower total cholesterol levels. Other parameters were not significantly different between the two groups, including dose of erythropoietin and calcium supplements administered. Our study provides evidence that clinical outcome in renal failure may depend to some extent on the mode of dialysis. Our results suggest that blood pressure level and serum cholesterol should be taken into account for patients treated with either CAPD or HD. Blood pressure and cholesterol level are both likely to be important contributors to mortality and morbidity in renal patients.","448":"The most common cause of drop-out from continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) therapy is an insufficient dose of dialysis. Several reports and the Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) guidelines recommend maintaining a weekly creatinine clearance (CCr) of at least 60 L\/1.73 m2. Previously, at our center, we found that many patients switched from CAPD to hemodialysis (HD) owing to insufficient solute clearance (less than 50 L\/1.73 m2). We attempted to determine whether once-weekly HD would improve solute clearance. We treated 7 cases (6 men, 1 woman; average age: 54.3 +\/- 4.5 years; mean duration of CAPD: 4.3 +\/- 1.1 years) with once-weekly HD therapy (3.5 hours; 200 mL\/hour). The average CCr was 45 +\/- 2 L\/1.73 m2. No ultrafiltration failure was found. Addition of once-weekly HD therapy improved CCr to 66 +\/- 7 L\/1.73 m2. That improvement was attributable to not only to the addition of HD therapy but also to an increase in peritoneal CCr for 3 consecutive days after completion of once-weekly HD therapy. Creatinine clearance and ultrafiltration were both significantly increased. Other clinical parameters such as blood pressure control, weight control, and dose of erythropoietin were significantly improved after introduction of once-weekly HD therapy. Moreover, uremic symptoms such as pruritus and depression were markedly improved. In conclusion, once-weekly HD therapy in conjunction with regular CAPD therapy improves solute clearance and symptoms related to uremia in CAPD patients with an insufficient dialysis dose.","449":"We successfully used argon plasma coagulation (APC) to treat two cases of dialysis patients with hemorrhagic gastric angiodysplasia. Gastric angiodysplasia is recognized as an important cause of gastrointestinal bleeding. Angiodysplastic lesion confined to the gastric antrum was first described in 1953 and named gastric antral vascular ectasia (GAVE). The condition is characterized as submucosal capillary dilatation and fibromuscular hyperplasia. The typical finding of GAVE is the so-called watermelon stomach, attributable to vasodilatation. In case 1, a 69-year-old man was introduced continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in July 1997 because of chronic renal failure due to nephrosclerosis. He was hospitalized for severe anemia in December 1997. Gastrointestinal fiberscopy (GIF) showed oozing in the antrum, and gastritis and esophagitis with sliding hernia. Famotidine was started and recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) was used for anemia. However, the severe anemia did not improve. The patient was hospitalized again for severe anemia and hematemesis. Another GIF showed typical watermelon stomach, which corresponded with GAVE. An APC was performed without complications. Three months later, the anemia was improved, and the dose of rHuEPO was reduced. In case 2, a 57-year-old woman was introduced to hemodialysis in 1998 for uremia due to nephrosclerosis. In October 2000, she was hospitalized for rHuEPO-resistant anemia. A GIF showed oozing in the antrum with diffuse vasodilation in the antrum; GAVE was diagnosed. An APC was carried out without complications. Three months later, anemia was improved. Recently, gastric angiodysplasia was reported to be an important complication in dialysis patients and was recognized as an important cause of rHuEPO-resistant anemia. Argon plasma coagulation is an effective treatment for gastric angiodysplasia in patients on dialysis.","450":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) is associated with a number of complications, some of which can be attributed to raised intra-abdominal pressure. Intra-abdominal pressure is highest during coughing or straining--activities which, fortunately, are transient. High pressure, primarily due to high volumes of PD solution, can predispose patients to hernias, dialysate leaks, and back pain; it can also cause altered mechanics of breathing. This article reviews those various complications and their management.","451":"We developed a new telemedicine system to monitor the condition of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients by using a cellular telephone and an Internet Web site. All data for the CAPD patients--blood pressure, heart rate, body weight, ultrafiltration volume, and urine volume--are collected and sent directly by cellular telephone to a data server that was constructed at the NTT DoCoMo Company data center. The system is directly connected to Internet by application service provider (ASP) technology. Anywhere, at any time, each patient can confirm changes in their data in graph form by using a cellular telephone or a computer connection to an Internet Web site. The average of each type of data is calculated and shown at the Web site. All data collected by cellular telephone are calculated and, in real time, sent directly to the treating physician's office over the Internet. Abnormal data are sent directly to the treating physician's office and shown in the host computer with an emergency signal (emergency alarm system). In addition, CAPD patients can easily contact the medical staff in the Kidney and Dialysis Center of Saitama Medical School (main hospital) using the same telemedicine system. We are using this telemedicine system for 46 CAPD patients being treated by Saitama Medical School. The cost of using the system is just US$3.00 or less per month for each patient. This newly developed system has great advantages for CAPD patients, especially elderly and handicapped patients. The system can be expanded into a network that serves all CAPD patients and all hospitals in Japan.","452":"Combined therapy [peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD)] has been used for ultrafiltration failure and inadequacy of dialysis dose in PD patients. To support the transition to, and continuation of, combined therapy, we investigated patient feelings about combined therapy. We performed a questionnaire survey of 23 combined-therapy patients (mean age: 48.9 years; mean PD duration: 67.9 months; mean combined therapy duration: 21.2 months). The questionnaire asked about feelings before and after combined therapy, physical improvements after combined therapy, and the patient's hopes about the method of dialysis therapy in the future. One patient did not answer, and one questionnaire was removed from the analysis owing to invalid responses. Before combined therapy, 15 patients (71.4%) had negative feelings toward combined therapy. After combined therapy, more than half of the patients experienced improvement in edema, general condition, weight control, complexion, and fatigue. Seventeen patients (81.0%) were satisfied with combined therapy, but 15 patients (71.4%) were uncomfortable with HD. For the future, 15 patients (71.4%) wanted to continue combined therapy, and 5 patients (23.8%) hoped to return to PD only. Patients accepted combined therapy because of the physical improvements, but were uncomfortable with HD because of hospital visits and pain from puncture. Before introducing PD, we need to provide accurate information about PD, combined therapy, HD, and the process of dialysis therapy.","453":"Health literacy (HL) is the ability to perform the basic reading, writing, and numerical skills required to function in a health care setting. Patients with adequate HL are able to read, interpret, and respond to health care information provided by health care providers and health plans. Several means of assessing HL are available for English- and Spanish-speaking patients. A review of the English-language literature on HL indicated that no prior studies included a subset of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. I administered the Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM) assessment tool to PD patients. I also asked patients for information about their highest education level completed. Following completion of the REALM, patients were classified as having adequate, marginal, or inadequate HL. As other studies have shown, patients with lower levels of education have inadequate HL. Patients with some college education or higher have adequate HL. However, at the average education level of patients, most patients have marginal HL. Relative lack of HL affects a patient's ability to make decisions regarding care as part of a home self-management program for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and other chronic illnesses. Consequently, relative HL level affects the method of instruction and the time required for instruction during training of PD patients.","454":"Nightly intermittent peritoneal dialysis (NIPD) with no day dwell has the potential to enhance peritoneal host defenses. We evaluated outcomes in 24 patients who had been placed on NIPD at the start of peritoneal dialysis as compared with outcomes of 24 control patients on standard continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). As compared with patients on CCPD, patients on NIPD had a lower peritonitis rate (0.34 episodes\/year vs. 0.59 episodes\/year, p &lt; 0.03) and fewer hospital admissions (1.0 admission\/year vs. 1.6 admissions\/year, p = 0.003). The weekly initial KtV was similar in NIPD and CCPD, but NIPD had significantly higher creatinine clearances owing to higher glomerular filtration rates (GFRs) among the patients (7.8 mL\/min vs. 4.8 mL\/min, p &lt; 0.02). Technique and patient survival were similar in both groups after controlling for the difference in initial GFR. We conclude that NIPD is a good modality choice for patients starting PD with residual renal function and that it present a low peritonitis risk. As GFR declines, a last fill can be added to maintain adequate clearances.","455":"Strategic planning for chronic dialysis services to allow cost-effective organization of resources and workforce planning is a difficult but essential task. The planning process within an individual unit involves consideration of both generic issues and issues specific to the unit. We used the Balance of Care approach to planning, which takes into account the affect that the dependency level of patients has on the therapeutic options and on how those options can be delivered. In a workshop format, we developed a spreadsheet computer model (RENPLAN) and applied it to facilitate discussion between clinical and non clinical health care professionals, dialysis unit managers, and renal patient representatives. Within the unit concerned, we used the model to explore a variety of planning options, including reducing the number of patients receiving automated peritoneal dialysis (proposed as a cost-reduction measure by managers). The model precisely calculates future resource requirements (staff numbers, hemodialysis stations, disposables costs), indicates deficits in clinical audit data, and facilitates education of non clinical managers regarding the major issues in dialysis planning. The RENPLAN model is freely available to all units and is adaptable for analysis of local planning issues.","456":"Our objective in the present study was to evaluate the dialysis dose required to maintain Japanese peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients in good condition. From 32 local hospitals, we selected 100 stable patients without diabetes mellitus who were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), and we performed the peritoneal function test using the newly developed PD NAVI software (JMS, Hiroshima, Japan). Weekly total Kt\/V and creatinine clearance (CCr) were calculated and plotted against body weight (BW) to evaluate the PD dose. In CAPD patients (n = 58), we found an inverse linear correlation between total Kt\/V and BW (r = -0.576). In the same patients, total Kt remained essentially constant (60 L\/week). Those results imply that most patients were being treated with the same PD regimen (2 L, 4 times daily), and that smaller patients were generally receiving a greater PD dose relative to body size than were the larger patients. In APD patients (n = 21), total Kt\/V and total CCr normalized to 1.73 m2 did not change with BW. Total Kt and non normalized CCr gradually increased with BW, although the correlation was not significant. Those findings suggest that most APD patients received prescriptions that were more closely based on body size. In conclusion, smaller patients generally receive a greater PD dose than do larger patients, and targeting a single value of Kt\/V or CCr may not always be relevant for adequate dialysis.","457":"In the present study, we investigated longitudinal changes in peritoneal function, as calculated by the personal dialysis capacity (PDC) test, after patient withdrawal from 17 years of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). In July 1982, a 42-year-old female was started on CAPD because of chronic renal failure. She performed CAPD without any trouble for 17 years. In July 1999, hemodialysis was introduced because of ultrafiltration failure. The CAPD catheter remained in place, and the patient subsequently performed intra-abdominal lavage, using a standard peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution, for 3 years. A PDC test was performed every 6 months before and after withdrawal from CAPD. In July 1999, the PDC test indicated a membrane area of 59,748 cm\/1.73 m2, absorption of 2.72 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, plasma loss of 0.049 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, and ultrafiltration volume (UFV) of -666 mL\/24 h. The dialysate-to-plasma ratio (D\/P) of creatinine after 4 hours was 0.96. An abdominal computed tomography (CT) scan showed calcification of the peritoneum. In March 2000, the PDC showed an area of 44,929 cm\/1.73 m2, absorption of 1.43 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, plasma loss of 0.092 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, and alpha UFV of 213 mL\/24 h. In August 2000 (1 year after CAPD withdrawal), the area was 38,492 cm\/1.73 m2; the absorption, 1.74 mL\/min\/1.73 m2; the plasma loss, 0.053 mL\/min\/1.73 m2; and the UFV, 348 mL\/24 h. Long-term intra-abdominal lavage induced a gradual reduction in membrane area, which returned to the normal range (19,028 cm\/1.73 m2) after 3 years. Ultrafiltration volume showed a gradual increase and reached its peak level (403 mL\/24 h) in July 2002. After 3 years, the D\/P creatinine was 0.82. However, an abdominal CT scan showed no change in the calcification of the peritoneum. From those data, we conclude that, in long-term CAPD patients, intra-abdominal lavage can induce improvement in peritoneal function, but not in calcification of the peritoneum.","458":"Since December 2000, we have proposed incremental dialysis to our patients with a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 8-9 mL\/min\/1.73 m2. The incremental dialysis uses automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) 3-4 days per week [\"low frequency APD\" (LF-APD)], with or without a full abdomen during the period between the nighttime sessions. From December 1, 2000, to September 30, 2001, LF-APD was selected by 5 patients (2 men, 3 women). Of the 5 patients, 4 worked (age: 53 +\/- 12 years; range: 40-69 years), and 1 (age: 78 years) needed assistance from a partner who was available only on certain days of the week. Only 1 patient had diabetic nephropathy. The LF-APD was performed by 4 patients on alternate days (\"standard LF-APD\"), and by 1 patient 3 times per week (owing to limited availability of the partner). At the beginning of treatment, mean nightly LF-APD was 8.9 +\/- 0.9 hours with a volume of 13.4 +\/- 3.1 L. In 3 patients, icodextrin was used for the dwell between subsequent APD sessions (1-1.5 L). The other 2 patients kept an empty abdomen (owing to body image). Residual renal function (RRF) was measured every 3 months; adequacy and peritoneal equilibration test (PET), every 6 months. Total nightly APD volume was modified based on the results of the PET. At December 31, 2002, 3 patients with follow-ups of 25, 22, and 15 months were still on LF-APD because their GFR had remained unchanged. In another patient, the frequency of the APD sessions was increased after 5 months to 5 times per week from 3.5 times per week following a clinical assessment of underdialysis; however, that patient had had no significant change in GFR. Following a rapid decline in the diabetic patient's GFR (to 3.6 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 from 7.9 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 in 18 months) and refusal by that patient to increase the number of days of APD, the diabetic patient was transferred to hemodialysis. No episodes of peritonitis occurred in a total LF-APD follow-up of 84 patient-months. Compliance, assessed using the HomeChoice Pro system and comparing prescribed and recorded sessions, was total (no missed treatments). In conclusion, LF-APD can be a valid form of incremental dialysis and can help patients to choose PD as their first renal replacement therapy.","459":"The goal of the quality improvement project reported here was to increase the proportion of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients receiving adequate dialysis as defined by the National Kidney Foundation-Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-DOQI) guidelines. Our approach was to increase the frequency with which we measured PD adequacy and changed prescriptions in response to low adequacy values. We developed 3 indicators, each one subdivided to reflect differences by type of PD and time on PD. Our improvement goal was to achieve the midpoint between baseline performance on those indicators and 100%, equating to a 50% reduction in failure rate (RFR). At baseline, the project included 122 facilities with 1,517 patients (data from October 1999 to March 2000). At re-measurement, we had 117 facilities with 1,372 patients (data from January 2001 to June 2001). In addition to obtaining facility-specific feedback reports, we conducted educational intervention workshops to which all PD providers were invited. After the workshops, \"mandatory intervention\" facilities submitted improvement plans that were reviewed by the PD Adequacy Work Group to determine if improvement actions were appropriately focused on identified root causes. Not all intervention facilities attended the workshops, and some facilities attended voluntarily. Overall, the Network 5 results showed a statistically significant improvement in measuring PD adequacy (84% baseline to 92% re-measurement), with a corresponding 51% RFR. Improvement in desired levels of adequacy was also statistically significant (55% baseline to 64% re-measurement), with a 21% RFR. Analysis by the intervention group showed that \"mandatory intervention\" facilities improved more than did \"voluntary\" facilities in measuring adequacy and in reaching desired levels, and that the differences were statistically significant. Quality improvement efforts that focused on improving the adequacy of PD in Network 5 were accomplished.","460":"Previous retrospective studies have reported that icodextrin may prolong peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment time in patients with refractory fluid overload (RFO). Because the annual cost of PD therapy is lower than that of hemodialysis (HD) therapy in Australia, we prospectively investigated the ability of icodextrin to prolong PD technique survival in patients with RFO. We used a computer model to estimate the savings associated with that therapeutic strategy, based on annual therapy costs determined in a regional PD and HD costing exercise. Patients who met standard criteria for RFO and who were otherwise to be converted immediately to HD, were asked to consent to an open-label assessment of the ability of icodextrin to delay the need to start HD. Time to conversion to HD was measured. The study enrolled 39 patients who were followed for a mean period of 1.1 years. Icodextrin significantly increased peritoneal ultrafiltration by a median value of 368 mL daily. It prolonged technique survival by a mean period of 1.21 years [95% confidence interval (CI): 0.80-1.62 years]. Extension of PD treatment time by icodextrin was particularly marked for patients who had ultrafiltration failure (UFF, n = 20), defined as net daily peritoneal ultrafiltration &lt; 1 L daily (mean extension time: 1.70 years; 95% CI: 1.16-2.25 years). Overall, annualized savings were US$3,683 per patient per year. If just the patients with UFF were considered, the savings increased to US$4,893 per year. Icodextrin prolongs PD technique survival in patients with RFO, permitting them to continue on their preferred therapy. In Australia, that practice is highly cost-effective, particularly in individuals with UFF.","461":null,"462":"Among the many factors contributing to mortality and morbidity in dialysis patients, nutrition is one of the most important. The ADEMEX (Adequacy of Peritoneal Dialysis in Mexico) study suggests that increasing the amount of daily dialysis to compensate for loss of residual renal function (RRF) does not change mortality or morbidity in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Our purpose in the present study was to determine whether a gradual increase in daily dialysis volume to compensate for loss of RRF interferes with the nutrition of patients. We studied the correlation between normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) and daily dialysis volume in 150 PD patients. The Student t-test was used to discover if the correlation was statistically significant. We found that, as the daily dialysis volume increases to replace lost RRF, nPCR declines significantly. This reverse relationship was statistically significant at a p value of 0.007. Replacement of lost RRF by an increase in daily dialysis volume in PD patients contributes significantly to their state of protein malnutrition. The large quantity of carbohydrate acquired through dialysis interferes with the patients' intake of protein. The resulting condition of malnutrition probably plays a significant role in mortality and morbidity in those patients.","463":"Our aim in the present study was to simultaneously determine, in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, interleukin-15 (IL-15) concentrations in serum and dialysate, peritoneal transport parameters, and ultrafiltration (UF). The study was performed in 42 patients who had been treated with PD for 24.5 +\/- 20.1 months. Concentration of IL-15 was measured (ELISA: IBL, Hamburg, Germany) during a peritoneal equilibration test. Of 42 patients, 69% had serum IL-15 concentrations above normal values (&lt; 13.0 pg.mL). The mean dialysate-to-plasma ratio (D\/P) for IL-15 exceeded 1. We observed a negative relationship between dialysate IL-15 and effluent volume. Patients with UF &lt; or = 200 mL or &lt; 100 mL had higher dialysate IL-15 concentration, higher D\/P for IL-15, higher mass transfer area coefficient (KBD) for creatinine, and higher dialysate creatinine concentration than patients with more UF. The KBD for creatinine correlated negatively with dialysate effluent volume. We conclude that, in PD patients, elevated serum and dialysate IL-15 concentrations confirm the existence of systemic and local inflammation; the source of IL-15 in dialysate is not only serum, but also local generation in the peritoneum; and dialysate IL-15 concentration may be a marker of UF capacity.","464":"We investigated whether a selective angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) would have a regressive effect on left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). In a double-blind study, 24 CAPD patients with LVH [left ventricular mass index (LVMi) &gt; 110 g\/m2 for women and LVMi &gt; 137 g\/m2 for men] were randomized to 12 months' administration of either the ARB valsartan (n = 14) or a placebo (n = 10). The target blood pressure (BP) was 140\/90 mmHg or lower in both groups. The following parameters were measured before and at the end of the study: aortic and large-artery compliance and arterial wave reflections [pulse wave velocity (PWV) and augmentation index (AI) application tonometry] and cardiac echocardiography. Periodically recorded were body weight, BP (mercury sphygmomanometer), serum creatinine, electrolytes, complete blood cell counts, urine volume, drainage volume, and weekly creatinine clearance. Two-way analysis of variance for repeated measurements was used for statistical analysis. Systolic and diastolic BP were both reduced in patients treated with ARB. The LVMi was significantly reduced in patients treated with ARB (to 121 +\/- 4 from 145 +\/- 5) but not in those receiving placebo (to 137 +\/- 3 from 152 +\/- 3, p &lt; 0.05). The decrease in LVMi was associated with a reduction in PWV and AI. In CAPD patients with LVH, ARB reduced LVMi in association with alterations in arterial hemodynamics.","465":"In the original peritoneal equilibration test (PET), which established standard values for membrane categorization in 1987, the dwell time of the preceding exchange was approximately 8 hours. Basing the test on an 8-hour prior exchange was convenient when almost all patients were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD); however, many patients are now on some form of automated peritoneal dialysis (PD), and an 8-hour exchange before the PET requires a change in the dialysis schedule. Our goal in the present study was to determine whether the dialysate-to-plasma ratio (D\/P) of solutes and the final dialysate to initial dialysate ratio (D\/D0) of glucose in the short PET (2-hour equilibration time) are similar whether a 3-hour exchange or an 8-hour exchange precedes the test. The PETs were performed in 9 stable PD patients using 2 L of 2.5% dextrose dialysis solution (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.). Before the equilibration exchange, the patients were on a randomly selected long (approximately 8-hour) or short (3-hour) dwell. During the equilibration exchange, dialysate samples were collected at 0.30, and 60 minutes of dwell time and from the drain bag (120-minute sample). Within a week, the PET was repeated in each patient after the alternate-length exchange. The values for D\/P creatinine and urea and for D\/D0 glucose were almost identical throughout the 2-hour PET after either the long or the short exchange. The D\/P protein values tended to be higher in the PET after the long exchange. The short PET can be used for clinical purposes, and the creatinine and glucose results can be used for membrane categorization. Any dwell time between 3 and 12 hours is acceptable for the preceding exchange, and the equilibration test may be performed with either a 2-hour or a 4-hour dwell. The protein values obtained after a 3-hour prior dwell differ from those obtained after a long prior dwell. Protein values must therefore be standardized in a larger number of patients.","466":"As noted in part I of this article, emerging evidence indicates that overt and (more commonly) subclinical volume expansion is frequent in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). That expansion in turn leads to hypertension. With loss of residual renal function, the hypertension becomes difficult to control even with increasing doses and varieties of antihypertensive drugs. Poor volume and blood pressure control aggravates already existing left ventricular hypertrophy and leads to increased cardiovascular morbidity and mortality. Indeed, cardiovascular events are the leading cause of death in PD patients. Part II of this article reviews various strategies available to manage fluid overload and hypertension. Also, we discuss sodium removal with various PD modalities and clinical studies related to use of low-sodium dialysis solutions.","467":"Cardiovascular disease is a leading cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease. Uncontrolled hypertension and volume expansion contribute to alternations in left ventricular geometry and are independent predictors of poor survival in dialysis patients. Excessive salt intake is a major handicap with loss of residual renal function. Sodium removal becomes inadequate in the face of declining residual renal function. Continued salt intake and inadequate sodium removal lead to volume expansion, which aggravates arterial hypertension. In part I of this two-part review, we consider information on dietary salt intake and its relationship to blood pressure and volume control in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. In addition, we review recently published studies on the use of various PD modalities to remove sodium, emphasizing the significance of volume expansion and uncontrolled hypertension in PD patients. Part II reviews the various measures available to enhance sodium and fluid removal in PD patients.","468":"Peritoneal sclerosis is one of the most important complications of peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment. Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) represents the most advanced stage of that disease and has a high mortality. No therapy of choice has been established for sclerosing peritonitis, although many have been proposed, with variable results. Tamoxifen has been successfully used in the treatment of patients with fibrosing diseases, mainly retroperitoneal fibrosis. Our purpose in the present study was to investigate whether treatment with tamoxifen in PD patients with peritoneal sclerosis has a beneficial effect. Among more than 450 patients treated in our program since 1980, 23 were diagnosed with peritoneal sclerosis. Of those 23.9 were treated with tamoxifen [20 mg every 12 hours: tamoxifen group (TG)] for a mean period of 14.5 +\/- 7 months (range: 6-30 months). The other 14 patients received no treatment and were considered the control group (CG). Both groups were similar in demography and peritoneal antecedents. Follow-up was longer in CG than in TG (mean: 47 months vs. 29 months), but the difference did not reach statistical significance. Mild thrombopenia in 1 patient was the only toxic effect observed with the use of tamoxifen. In CG, 4 patients developed EPS and died--3 of them during the first 6 months after diagnosis. No patient treated with tamoxifen developed EPS. Overall mortality was significantly higher in CG (71% vs. 22%, p = 0.03). Although follow-up was longer in CG, half the patients in that group died during the first 2 years after diagnosis. Our experience suggests that treatment with tamoxifen of patients diagnosed with peritoneal sclerosis diminishes the related complications and significantly reduces mortality, at least in the short- to mid-term. However, a prospective therapeutic trial is required to confirm our results.","469":"Today, low molecular weight heparins (LMWHs) are more and more commonly used. They are about to replace standard heparin in certain circumstances. The pharmacokinetics of intraperitoneal standard heparin are well known in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), but data concerning LMWHs are lacking. The present study investigated the pharmacokinetics of intraperitoneal LMWHs in a single dose and compared them with the subcutaneous route in CAPD patients. The study enrolled 8 CAPD patients with a mean age of 47 +\/- 14.14 years. All patients had 40 mg enoxaparin added to their night exchange on one day. Blood samples were drawn just before instillation and at 2, 4, 8, 12, 18, and 24 hours after instillation for determination of plasma antifactor Xa activity. After two days of washout, the same patients were given enoxaparin 40 mg subcutaneously, and blood samples were drawn at the same time points. Although no plasma factor Xa activity was seen after intraperitoneal administration, subcutaneous administration resulted in increased plasma factor Xa activity. We conclude that a single dose of intraperitoneal enoxaparin did not cause any change in plasma anti-factor Xa activity. That finding may be due either to an insufficient dose or to nonabsorption.","470":"The dialysate concentration of cancer antigen 125 (CA125) can be considered a reflection of mesothelial cell mass or turnover in stable continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. The effect of dwell times exceeding 4 hours on CA125 appearance rate (CA125AR) is not known. Therefore, our objective in the present study was to analyze the effect of dwell time on CA125AR in stable CAPD patients. In 43 stable CAPD patients, we analyzed standard peritoneal permeability analyses (SPAs) performed with a 3.86% glucose dialysate, and night-dwell effluents from the night dwell prior to the SPA. Dialysate CA125 concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay (RIA II: Fujirebio Diagnostics, Malvern, PA, U.S.A.). Night-dwell CA125 correlated with the duration of the dwell (r = 0.32, p = 0.04) and with the CA125 concentration in the 4-hour dwell (r = 0.83, p &lt; 0.001). The mean CA125AR in the SPA effluent was 97.8 +\/- 46.3 U\/min; in the overnight effluent, it was 108.8 +\/- 73.7 U\/min (nonsignificant). A good correlation was present between the CA125AR in the 4-hour dwells and in the overnight dwells (r = 0.82, p &lt; 0.001). We conclude that using night dwells to regularly assess dialysate CA125--for instance, at every out-patient visit--is possible in CAPD patients, provided that appearance rate is calculated.","471":"Peritoneal dialysis affects both the quantity and quality of connective tissue in the visceral peritoneum. In the present study, we report the alterations observed in the morphology of the superficial liver lobuli of dialyzed rats. The studies were performed in male Wistar rats weighing 250-350 g. Rats were exposed intraperitoneally to 0.9% NaCl, phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), or commercial dialysis solutions containing 3.86% glucose (Dianeal 3.86%: Baxter Healthcare SA, Castlebar, Ireland; CAPD3 and CAPD3-Balance: Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany) twice daily for 4-6 weeks. At the end of the study, samples of the liver were taken and stained for light microscopy (hematoxylin and eosin, van Gieson). The results obtained in dialyzed rats were compared with those from the control, non dialyzed animals. In control animals, the surface of the hepatic parenchyma was smooth. In all dialyzed rats, irrespective of the solution used, folding of the surface of the liver parenchyma was found owing to penetration of connective tissue elements between the hepatocytes. In effect, folds of hepatocytes within the liver capsule became detached and isolated from the remaining cells of the lobules. The distinctive feature of that pathologic change was that its severity increased with the thickness of the peritoneum. The change was seen in rats exposed to any of the experimental solutions, and therefore appeared to be attributable to a non-specific reaction caused by exposure of the peritoneum to dialysis fluid and not to specific components of the fluid. The observed alterations in morphology seem to suggest disturbed function within the affected lobules. Further studies are necessary to confirm this hypothesis.","472":"In previous studies, we showed that glucose reduces the morphologic changes in rat peritoneum caused by chronic intraperitoneal administration of 0.9% NaCl solution. In the present study, we set out to determine if the observed results were attributable to hyperosmolarity or to the metabolic effect of the glucose. Intraperitoneal catheters were implanted in 19 rats. The animals were then intraperitoneally exposed twice daily for 30 days to 20 mL 0.9% saline supplemented with either 250 mmol\/L glucose (GLU, n = 9) or 250 mmol\/L mannitol (MAN, n = 10). Control rats did not undergo catheter implantation or the dialysis procedure (CON, n = 6). At the end of the study, a 1-hour peritoneal equilibration test (PET) using Dianeal 3.86% (Baxter Healthcare SA, Castlebar, Ireland) was performed in every dialyzed rat to analyze peritoneal transport. Afterward, the rats were humanely killed by bleeding, and a semi-quantitative scale was used to evaluate adhesions in the peritoneal cavity. Imprints of the visceral mesothelium and samples of the visceral peritoneum (liver) were then taken and analyzed by light microscopy. The PET results for glucose, urea, creatinine, and total protein were comparable in both experimental groups. We found that intraperitoneal adhesions were more severe in the MAN group (6 rats with adhesions graded &gt; 3) than in the GLU group (only 1 such rat). No difference in peritoneal thickness was observed between the experimental groups (MAN: 54.9 +\/- 17.8 microns; GLU: 51.2 +\/- 14.5 microns); however, in both experimental groups, the thickness was greater than in the CON group (3.9 +\/- 0.6 microns). The density of the peritoneal blood vessels tended to be greater in the MAN group than in the GLU group (0.158 +\/- 0.072 vessels\/1000 microns 2 vs. 0.085 +\/- 0.067 vessels\/1000 microns 2, p = 0.0541). No visible blood vessels were evident in the CON group. The density of mesothelial cells was higher in the MAN group than in the GLU group (2456 +\/- 333 cells\/mm 2 vs. 2090 +\/- 322 cells\/mm 2, p &lt; 0.05), and, in both experimental groups, the cell density was higher than in the CON group (817 +\/- 100 cells\/mm 2, p &lt; 0.01). The nucleus: cytoplasm area ratio in mesothelial cells was comparable in the MAN and GLU groups (0.206 +\/- 0.039 and 0.176 +\/- 0.045), but that ratio was higher in both experimental groups than in the CON group (0.086 +\/- 0.010, p &lt; 0.01). We conclude that glucose-induced changes in the peritoneum of rats exposed to chronic peritoneal dialysis depend on both osmotic and metabolic effects.","473":"The transport capacity of any membrane depends on its surface area and permeability. In addition, peritoneal capillaries are probably barriers to solute transport. Although no decisive use of antihypertensive drugs has been reported in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients with hypertension, those drugs are known to have various effects on vessels. In the present study, we used a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera in renovascular hypertensive dogs with mild renal insufficiency to investigate the effects of various antihypertensive drugs on the peritoneal capillaries. Renovascular hypertension was induced in the dogs by placing silver clips on both renal arteries to create 90% occlusion. After confirmation of elevation of blood pressure (usually 20 days after the operation), each dog's abdomen was opened while the animal was under general anesthesia. Using a CCD camera, the diameters of the small arteries of the peritoneum were measured after 3 days' oral administration of a placebo (n = 5); or of 8 mg CS866, a selective angiotensin II type 1 receptor blocker (n = 5); or of 10 mg benazepril, an angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (n = 5); or of 10 mg amlodipine, a calcium antagonist (n = 5). In dogs receiving CS866, blood pressure decreased to 128 +\/- 6 mmHg from 160 +\/- 6 mmHg (p &lt; 0.01). A similar decrease in blood pressure was observed with the use of the other drugs. The diameter of the small vessels increased by 28% +\/- 6% in dogs receiving CS866 and by 24% +\/- 5% in dogs receiving benazepril, as compared with 3% +\/- 3% in dogs receiving the calcium antagonist. These data clearly demonstrate that blockade of the renin-angiotensin system produces an increase in solute clearance in hypertensive dogs with mild renal insufficiency and that such blockade may be applicable as therapy for hypertensive patients on CAPD.","474":"Sodium sieving is a measure of free water transport. However its assessment is disturbed when a large difference exists between sodium concentrations in plasma and in dialysate--that is, when the diffusion rate is high. Based on previous findings concerning similarity in the mass transfer area coefficients (MTACs) of sodium and urate, we developed a model that corrects for high diffusion. The model enabled us to predict the dialysate sodium concentration resulting from diffusion alone at any time point during a dwell. The correction was based on knowledge of the intraperitoneal volume at any time point during the dwell, which can be calculated by using a volume marker (reference method). However, in a peritoneal equilibration test (PET), only the drained volume after 4 hours is available, and urate concentration is not routinely measured. Therefore, our objective in the present study was to investigate whether a diffusion correction using the MTAC of creatinine and the drained volume at the end of the dwell would be as accurate in estimating maximum sodium sieving as the reference method is. We analyzed standardized 4-hour dwells in 28 patients, 19 with stable PD and 9 with ultrafiltration failure. The dialysate consisted of a 3.86% glucose-containing solution to which dextran 70 was added as a volume marker. The correlation coefficient between the PET correction method and the reference method was 0.92 in all patients [0.90 in stable patients and 0.95 in the patients with ultrafiltration failure (p &lt; 0.01 for all)]. We conclude that a diffusion correction for sodium can be made using PET data. A diffusion correction yields a better estimate of sodium sieving than does the sole use of the lowest dialysate-to-plasma (D\/P) sodium irrespective of diffusion rate.","475":"In patients on long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), peritoneal dysfunction is considered to be due to the loss of peritoneal mesothelial cells and to subsequent peritoneal fibrosis and neovascularization. Our aim in the present study was to clarify the role of various components of peritoneal dialysis fluid in the occurrence of peritoneal dysfunction in CAPD patients. We used a cell counting assay and ELISA to study the viability of human peritoneal mesothelial cells and their secretion of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF)--which induces peritoneal fibrosis and neovascularization--by cells cultured with various components of peritoneal dialysis fluid. The viability of cultured cells, ranked from highest to lowest by solution type, was bicarbonate (40 mEq\/L) &gt; lactate (15 mEq\/L) + bicarbonate (25 mEq\/L) &gt; lactate (40 mEq\/L). Viability also showed a concentration-dependent decrease in the presence of advanced glycation end-products of bovine serum albumin. The bFGF level in the supernatant showed a concentration-dependent increase in the presence of glucose and glycated albumin; bFGF level decreased as the bicarbonate concentration increased. Low levels of glucose, lactate, and glycated albumin, and a high concentration of bicarbonate may preserve the viability of peritoneal mesothelial cells and prevent bFGF secretion.","476":"","477":"Anorexia and protein malnutrition, occasionally associated with obesity, are frequently observed in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Both are recognized risk factors for cardiovascular (CV) morbidity and mortality. Leptin is produced by adipocytes and regulates body-fat mass through a satiety central effect. Leptin accumulates in the uremic state. We analyzed the relationship between plasma leptin levels, nutritional status, obesity, CV risk factors, and atherosclerosis in PD patients. Leptin was determined using a polyclonal antibody [radioimmunoassay: Linco Research, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.]. The normal range was 1-7.8 ng\/mL. We studied 38 PD patients. Mean leptin levels were 59.1 +\/- 57.5 ng\/mL (elevated in 32 patients). Women (n = 21) showed higher leptin levels than did men (80.4 +\/- 60 ng\/mL vs. 32.3 +\/- 43.3 ng\/mL, p &lt; 0.01), in spite of both groups having a similar body mass index (BMI). A statistically significant direct correlation was found between leptin and BMI (r = 0.7, p &lt; 0.01) and triceps skin-fold measurement (r = 0.77, p &lt; 0.01). Leptin levels and renal creatinine clearance (CCr) showed no significant correlation. Independent of BMI, higher leptin levels were associated with parameters considered to be CV risk factors (Framingham study), such as serum triglycerides &lt; 150 mg\/dL (n = 29) as compared with &gt; 150 mg\/dL (44.2 +\/- 53.2 ng\/mL vs. 80 +\/- 58.4 ng\/mL, p &lt; 0.05), cholesterol &lt; 250 mg\/dL (n = 28) as compared with &gt; 250 mg\/dL, (50 +\/- 55.6 mg\/dL vs. 84.7 +\/- 57.7 mg\/dL, p &lt; 0.05), uric acid &lt; 7 mg\/dL (n = 28) as compared with &gt; 7 mg\/dL (47 +\/- 53.7 mg\/dL vs. 93.1 +\/- 56.6 mg\/dL, p &lt; 0.05), and the presence or lack of presence of left ventricular hypertrophy [68.8 +\/- 60 (n = 30) vs. 29.5 +\/- 23.7 (n = 5), p &lt; 0.05]. The patients were classified into two groups according to a clinical atherosclerosis score (CAS). Nineteen patients had low CAS scores, and they showed higher plasma leptin values than did the other patients (82.4 +\/- 65.7 ng\/mL vs 35.8 +\/- 36.6 ng\/mL, p &lt; 0.05). Twelve patients with anorexia had lower leptin values than did patients with normal appetite (19.2 +\/- 15.8 ng\/mL vs. 91.3 +\/- 58.8 ng\/mL, p &lt; 0.001). In non obese patients (BMI &lt; 25 and CCr &lt; 3 mL\/min, n = 14), leptin had a statistically significant direct linear correlation with markers of nutrition, including albumin (r = 0.63, p &lt; 0.05), transferrin (r = 0.4, p &lt; 0.05), cholesterol (r = 0.65, p &lt; 0.05), and triglycerides (r = 0.6, p &lt; 0.05). Finally, plasma leptin levels were notably increased in the PD population, indicating increased production (possibly by chronic hyperinsulinism), or uremic retention, or both. By multivariate analysis, we confirmed the association between leptin levels and sex, leptin and BMI, and leptin levels &gt; 40 ng\/mL and sex and LVH. All of those features suggest that plasma leptin levels could be considered a marker of CV risk and food intake in non obese PD patients without inflammation.","478":"Atherosclerosis is an important cause of morbidity and mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Oxidative stress plays a role in the pathogenesis of uremic atherosclerosis. Although antioxidant substances (vitamins A and E) are elevated in the plasma of dialysis patients, intracellular and clinical signs of hypovitaminosis are frequently found. Recently, the importance of vitamin\/carrier complexes as a marker of vitamin bioavailability has been demonstrated. In the present study, we analyzed vitamin A and E bioavailability, measured as vitamin\/carrier complexes, and the relationship of those measurements with clinical atherosclerosis status in PD patients. We studied 45 patients (15 men, 30 women), who were divided into four groups according to clinical atherosclerotic score (CAS). Five cases were scored as CAS grade 1 (low CAS); 9 as CAS-2; 18 as CAS-3; and 13 as CAS-4. Vitamins A and E and their carriers [prealbumin and retinol binding protein (vitamin A), and cholesterol and triglycerides (vitamin E)] were determined. Plasma levels of vitamin A were low in 5 patients, normal in 7 patients, and high in 33 patients. By correcting the values for the carrier levels, we created three groups: 24 patients showed low vitamin A\/carrier complex (5 from the low plasma vitamin A group, 6 from the normal-value group, and 13 from the high-value group); 11 patients were in the group with normal vitamin A\/carrier (1 from the normal plasma vitamin A group, and 10 from the high-value group); and 10 patients were in the group with high vitamin A\/carrier. The vitamin A\/carrier complex showed a statistically significant, negative linear correlation with CAS and with serum iron. Low vitamin E plasma levels were found in 1 patient, normal levels in 28 patients, and high levels in 16 patients. When those values were corrected using the carrier values, three groups were also created. The group with low vitamin E\/carrier complex contained 24 patients (1 from the low-value group, 22 from the normal-value group, and 1 from the high-value group). The group with normal vitamin E\/carrier complex contained 21 patients (15 from the group with high vitamin E values, and 6 from the normal-value group). By univariate logistic regression analysis, significant associations between CAS and vitamin E plasma levels, vitamin E\/carrier, age, and serum albumin were found. In the multiple logistic regression analysis, we confirmed that vitamin E\/carrier complex, age, and serum albumin showed independent associations with CAS, but not with vitamin-only plasma levels. Our results in PD patients show a vitamin\/carrier complex disorder that results in elevated vitamin mobilization from pool and target cells. Our results and the findings of other researchers about intracellular vitamin A and E deficiencies may change the traditional concept of hypervitaminosis A and E in uremic patients.","479":"Treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in dialysis patients has been associated with improvement of nutritional and immune status through an increase of cytokine production [such as tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha)]. The high cytokine production can be a double-edged sword owing to the relationship of cytokines with the systemic inflammatory process, which has been associated with many complications of uremic status. Our aim was to analyze the medium-long term effects of rHuEPO treatment on uremic inflammatory markers. We studied 45 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients divided in two groups: a rHuEPO group (40-70 subcutaneous units\/kg weekly) and a control group (no rHuEPO). The treated group was analyzed in four periods. Period 1 (rHuEPO-1) included 24 patients who had been using rHuEPO at long-term. Period 2 (rHuEPO-2; n = 21) looked at the patients 2 months after rHuEPO withdrawal. Period 3 (rHuEPO-3; n = 19) looked at the patients after 2 months under rHuEPO therapy. Period 4 (rHuEPO-4; n = 17) looked at the patients after 4 months on rHuEPO treatment. With the reintroduction of rHuEPO, we observed a progressive, statistically significant (p &lt; 0.05), and temporary increase in TNF alpha plasma levels, from 44 +\/- 24 pg\/mL (rHuEPO-2) to 76.8 +\/- 25 pg\/mL (rHuEPO-3), and then to 83 +\/- 27 pg\/mL (rHuEPO-4). But in the long term, TNF alpha decreased [33.5 +\/- 10 pg\/mL (rHuEPO-1)]. Similarly, albumin increased in the short term (3.73 +\/- 0.5 g\/dL to 4 +\/- 0.5 g\/dL, and then to 4 +\/- 0.43 g\/dL), and then decreased (3.8 +\/- 0.44 g\/dL). The normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) increased from 1 +\/- 0.2 g\/kg daily to 1.12 +\/- 0.3 g\/kg daily (rHuEPO-4). Long term, nPCR decreased to 1.06 +\/- 0.3 g\/kg daily. Leptin initially increased (60.1 +\/- 48 ng\/mL to 42.8 +\/- 22 ng\/mL, and then to 38 +\/- 18.2 ng\/mL); it also increased in the long term (62 +\/- 50.9, p &lt; 0.05). At baseline, we found a significant positive linear correlation (p &lt; 0.05) between TNF alpha and leptin (r = 0.52), TNF alpha and C-reactive protein [(CRP) r = 0.4], CRP and leptin (r = 0.49), fibrinogen and CRP (r = 0.78, p &lt; 0.01), fibrinogen and leptin (r = 0.37), and leptin and body mass index [(BMI) r = 0.67]. In conclusion, rHuEPO induces a temporary, non inflammatory immune hyperactivity mediated by TNF alpha, without the adverse effects associated with that cytokine. By decreasing leptin, rHuEPO could increase food intake and improve the nutritional status of PD patients. At baseline, we confirm the existence of a chronic inflammatory process in uremia.","480":"Malnutrition is highly prevalent in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and is associated with higher mortality. Lower serum levels of markers of nutrition--such as albumin, creatinine, prealbumin, and total cholesterol--are important risk factors in PD patients. Usefulness of bioimpedance analysis (BIA) in hemodialysis (HD) patients has been reported. In the present study, we prospectively examined the relationship of bioimpedance indexes to the nutrition status and survival of 45 PD patients who were followed for more than 1 year. On patient enrollment, a BIA was performed (Bioelectrical Impedance Analyzer, Model BIA-101: RJL Systems, Clinton Township, MI, U.S.A.). Monthly blood was analyzed for biochemical markers. The mean age of the study group was 50 +\/- 15 years. Of the 45 patients, 56% were female and 24% were diabetic. Mean body mass index was 25.7 +\/- 5.1. Mean resistance, reactance, capacitance, and phase angle were 524 +\/- 106 omega 57 +\/- 20 omega, 678 +\/- 223 pF, and 6.2 +\/- 1.7 degrees respectively. Patients with diabetes had lower capacitance (555 pF vs. 713 pF, p = 0.007) and phase angle (5.35 degrees vs. 6.4 degrees, p = 0.05) than patients without diabetes. During the study period, 4 patients died. Patients who survived had higher capacitance (486 +\/- 163 pF vs. 697 +\/- 218 pF, p = 0.07) and phase angle (4.65 +\/- 0.73 degrees, vs. 6.34 +\/- 1.67 degrees, p = 0.008) than those who did not survive. The Kaplan-Meier method was used to compute observed survival. The cumulative observed survival of PD patients with an enrollment phase angle &gt; or = 6 degrees was significantly (p = 0.01) higher than that of patients with an enrollment phase angle &lt; 6 degrees. Reactance was directly correlated with albumin (r = 0.52, p &lt; 0.0001) and total protein (r = 0.44, p &lt; 0.05). Capacitance was directly correlated with body mass index (r = 0.35, p &lt; 0.05), albumin (r = 0.32, p &lt; 0.05), and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (r = 0.44, p &lt; 0.01), and inversely correlated with body weight (r = -0.51, p &lt; 0.0001). Phase angle was directly correlated with all of the biochemical markers of nutrition, such as albumin (r = 0.54, p &lt; 0.01), total protein (r = 0.38, p &lt; 0.05), creatinine (r = 0.28, p &lt; 0.01), and BUN (r = 0.39, p &lt; 0.05). By stepwise multivariate regression analysis, body weight (beta = -0.60, p &lt; 0.0001) and total protein (beta = 0.32, p = 0.012) were significant determinants of resistance. Body weight (beta = -0.31, p = 0.02) and albumin (beta = 0.59, p &lt; 0.0001) were significant predictors of reactance. Serum albumin (beta = 0.53, p &lt; 0.0001) was the only best predictor of phase angle in PD patients. The BIA indices reflect nutrition status in PD patients, and may be useful in monitoring nutrition interventions.","481":"Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (Ox-LDL) has been related with progression of atherosclerosis. Some studies reported increased Ox-LDL levels in hemodialysis (HD) patients. The levels of Ox-LDL in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients have not yet been clarified. We measured Ox-LDL in PD patients and investigated the related factors. We measured plasma Ox-LDL, total cholesterol (TC), triglycerides (TG), and LDL-cholesterol (LDL-c) levels in 18 PD patients (mean age: 55.5 +\/- 9.8 years; mean duration of dialysis: 2.7 +\/- 1.4 years) and in 24 HD patients as controls. We compared Ox-LDL levels in patients with diabetes mellitus (DM) and ischemic heart disease (IHD). And we looked at the correlation between Ox-LDL levels and adequacy of PD. Levels of Ox-LDL were significantly higher in the PD patients (2.24 +\/- 1.14 ng\/microgram LDL protein) than in the HD patients (1.43 +\/- 0.90 ng\/microgram LDL protein), and other lipids were higher in the PD patients. The Ox-LDL did not correlate with other lipids. The Ox-LDL levels of the PD patients with DM or IHD were higher than those of non DM or non IHD patients. The adequacy of PD did not correlate with Ox-LDL. Patients on PD, especially those with DM or IHD, showed elevated Ox-LDL levels. Special attention should be paid to the level of Ox-LDL and atherosclerosis in PD patients.","482":"Residual renal function (RRF) is an important factor in the well-being of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Serum phosphate has been correlated with long-term morbidity and mortality. We wished to determine if RRF contributes to a lower level of serum phosphate and magnesium. We also investigated the relationship between protein catabolic rate (PCR) and phosphate and magnesium. We collected data related to serum phosphate, serum magnesium, PCR, and RRF in 100 PD patients. The Pearson correlation coefficient was used to study the correlation between RRF and magnesium, RRF and phosphate, PCR and magnesium, and PCR and phosphate. No relationship were seen between PCR and serum phosphate, and RRF and serum magnesium. Significant relationships were seen between PCR and serum magnesium and phosphate. The very good inverse correlation between RRF and serum phosphate highlights the importance of RRF in the control of serum phosphate. A very good relationship was also seen between PCR and serum magnesium.","483":"Our project identified, by flow cytometry, the immunophenotypes and activation state of the immune cells in the peritoneal dialysis fluid from patients with peritonitis on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. The results showed that all kinds of cells of the immune system were present in the peritoneal fluid in percentages and activation states similar to those seen in blood. Also, two subgroups of patients were noted, according to CD4:CD8 ratio. Patients whose ratio was &lt; 1.1 had more expansion of CD8 and NK cells, and a higher percentage of B1 cells in both fluids than were seen in healthy people.","484":null,"485":null,"486":null,"487":"The increased use of automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) has generated interest in potential differences in the incidence and causes of peritonitis between APD and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Several seldom-considered factors may influence peritonitis rates in those patient groups. Patient selection and sequence of therapies, reuse practices, effect of solutions on host defenses, and promptness of diagnosis may have an effect on peritonitis rates. Those factors are reviewed in light of recent literature and technologic advances.","488":"In patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), exit-site care is troublesome. We developed a new method for exit-site care, using a dressing film. We investigated the possibility of keeping the exit site clean for up to 6 weeks, using seven protocols: Control group (n = 24)--the exit site was cleaned with a povidone iodine solution daily and a gauze dressing was applied. Group A (n = 120)--the exit site was cleaned with a povidone iodine solution once weekly, was covered with a small piece of gauze, and was completely sealed using a dressing film. Group B (n = 181)--as with Group A, except once every 2 weeks. Group C (n = 64)--as with Group A, except once every 3 weeks. And so on: Group D (n = 45)--once every 4 weeks. Group E (n = 8)--once every 5 weeks. Group F (n = 2)--once every 6 weeks. At each session, we examined the small gauze bacteriologically. In groups A-F, the patients were asked to bathe every day and not to do anything about the exit site for 1-6 weeks, as applicable. In the control group, the rate of positive bacterial culture was 87.5%. In the other groups, the rates were group A, 15%; group B, 6.6%; group C, 6.3%; group D, 2.2%; and groups E and F, 0%. In the film-method groups, the rates of positive bacterial culture were significantly low. We thought that the film method kept the exit site clean.","489":"Tuberculous peritonitis is not an uncommon cause of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) peritonitis in endemic countries. The diagnosis is usually delayed because peritoneal fluid smears for acid-fast bacilli (AFB) are insensitive, and cultures for Mycobacterium tuberculosis require weeks. The present paper reports two cases of tuberculous CAPD peritonitis that were rapidly diagnosed using gene amplification for M. tuberculosis DNA complex by polymerase chain reaction with the commercial Amplicor M. tuberculosis nucleic acid amplification test (Roche Diagnostic Systems, Branchburg, NJ, U.S.A.). A 18-year-old man and a 50-year-old man, both on CAPD, developed culture-negative peritonitis. Empirical therapy with intraperitoneal vancomycin and gentamicin failed. Peritoneal fluid AFB smears were negative. In both patients, M. tuberculosis DNA complex was detected by nucleic acid amplification using the Amplicor test. Anti-tuberculosis treatment was unsuccessful and their catheters were removed. Six weeks later, their peritoneal fluid cultures isolated M. tuberculosis. The use of molecular techniques to assist in the diagnosis of pulmonary tuberculosis is well accepted. Little information exists regarding the use of molecular techniques in the diagnosis of tuberculous CAPD peritonitis. The diagnosis of tuberculous peritonitis in CAPD patients is frequently delayed and may cause increased morbidity and mortality. Molecular diagnosis of tuberculous peritonitis using nucleic acid amplification tests may allow more rapid diagnosis. Further studies are required to determine the sensitivity and specificity of the technique in CAPD patients with tuberculous peritonitis.","490":"We evaluated the usefulness of periodic abdominal irrigation through the peritoneal catheter preserved after termination of peritoneal dialysis (PD) to prevent encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS). The study group included 8 patients in whom PD had been terminated (mean age: 53.1 +\/- 7.1 years; mean PD duration: 119.6 +\/- 37.8 months). The abdominal cavity was periodically irrigated through the peritoneal catheter preserved after PD discontinuation. The appearance rate of cancer antigen 125 (CA125-AR), corrected by body surface area, was obtained every 3 months from 4-hour dwells. Based on the creatinine levels in 4-hour dwells and plasma, the dialysate-to-plasma creatinine (D\/P Cr) was also obtained. Following abdominal irrigation for more than 12 months, the peritoneal catheter was removed and a biopsy specimen was taken from the peritoneum. The CA125-AR increased 3 months after PD discontinuation, but decreased thereafter. Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis developed in 3 of 4 patients who lacked parietal mesothelial cells (PMCs) in a peritoneal specimen. In contrast, a good prognosis was obtained in 4 patients who had PMCs. The maximum value of the change in CA125-AR (delta CA125-AR, as compared with the value at PD discontinuation) was significantly greater in the PMC+ group than in the PMC- group (8.0 +\/- 2.7 vs. 3.4 +\/- 3.1, p &lt; 0.001). The D\/P Cr at catheter removal was lower in the PMC+ group than in the PMC- group (0.45 +\/- 0.21 vs. 0.85 +\/- 0.18, p &lt; 0.05). Our findings suggest that periodic abdominal irrigation through the peritoneal catheter preserved after PD enhances the recovery of peritoneal damage. The CA125-AR value is a useful marker of viability and proliferation of PMCs.","491":"A growing incidence of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) has been reported recently in Japan, and it is now urgent to establish preventive measures against EPS development. In the present paper, we describe our observational results regarding the risk of EPS development and the characteristic features of patients with EPS, in terms of peritoneal morphology and peritoneal function as determined by peritoneal equilibration test. The ongoing working protocol for EPS prevention at Jikei University Hospital is also discussed. Our findings have revealed that long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is a risk factor for EPS development after transfer to hemodialysis from peritoneal dialysis (PD), and that, in most patients with EPS, peritoneal function is characterized by a longstanding high-transport state. The striking alterations in peritoneal morphology between patients with EPS and those with simple long-term CAPD hyperplasia include, in EPS patients, a prominent thickening of the collagenous layer of the peritoneum with neoangiogenesis and myofibroblastic transformation. Based on our findings, we established a withdrawal protocol for long-term CAPD patients, with the goal of preventing EPS. Those who have been on PD treatment for more than 72 months with high-transport state are candidates for withdrawal from PD, with performance of peritoneal lavage thereafter for a certain period of time. The clinical benefit of post-PD lavage has not yet been determined; however, the maneuver could be precluded in patients at low risk of EPS, because it was found that some patients can recover to average transport state during the period of PD withdrawal. Patients who remain high transporters with inflammatory reaction might require pharmacologic intervention, including prednisolone therapy. Further observations are required to validate our approach.","492":"Although encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is feared as a fatal complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD), several recent studies have reported that many cases of EPS can be completely cured by appropriate methods of prevention and treatment. In this study, we describe therapeutic tactics for EPS and discuss methods of prevention. To begin, appropriate management of peritonitis and use of a biocompatible dialysis fluid are important to prevent the development of EPS. After the development of EPS is confirmed, the basic therapeutic tactics should be chosen according to the disease stage. That is, immediately after onset (inflammatory stage), EPS should be initially treated by steroid administration. If steroid therapy is ineffective, the steroid dose should be decreased immediately, and followed (encapsulating stage) by management with total parenteral nutrition (TPN). If ileus symptoms remain (ileus stage), active laparotomy and total intestinal enterolysis should be performed. During surgical treatment of EPS, it is important to perform total enterolysis without damaging the capsule-covered intestine. We believe that EPS is no longer an incurable disease, and that it can be completely cured by active diagnosis and treatment.","493":"To evaluate the incidence and characteristics of encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS), we analyzed 111 patients who had been transferred to hemodialysis and had been periodically monitored using the peritoneal equilibration test. Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis was diagnosed in 11 patients. All patients had high-transport peritoneum, and 10 patients had been treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for more than 72 months. Incidence of EPS increased according to prolongation of CAPD. To evaluate outcome, we analyzed 15 cases of EPS. All patients were treated with total parenteral nutrition (TPN). Five patients improved with TPN alone. However, the remaining 10 patients showed deterioration. Of those 10, 4 patients died. They had not been treated with corticosteroids (CSs). The remaining 6 patients were treated with CSs, but they did not improve. Those cases required surgical treatment. The postoperative course in 4 patients was satisfactory, but 2 patients died. In our center, the EPS survival rate was 60%. In patients treated with TPN alone, the remission rate was only 33.3%. Administration of CSs could not improve that rate. In 6 patients treated with surgery, the mortality rate was 33.3%. When EPS symptoms are not ameliorated by CS and TPN, surgical treatment should be considered. To prevent EPS, high-risk patients who have more than 72 months on CAPD and who have a high-transport peritoneum should discontinue CAPD.","494":"Increased peritoneal function has been suggested to be a risk factor for developing encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS); however, clinical evidence is scarce. The present study aimed to clarify the specific character of peritoneal function in patients who developed EPS after withdrawal from peritoneal dialysis (PD). We studied 12 patients who developed EPS after PD withdrawal [(EPS group) mean PD duration: 109 months; mean period of EPS development: 7.0 months after withdrawal] and 128 patients who did not develop EPS (non EPS group). All 140 patients were withdrawn from continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and were observed for the following 24 months. Based on the records of the annual peritoneal equilibration tests (PETs), we analyzed (1) the patients' dialysate-to-plasma (D\/P) creatinine at various durations on PD, and (2) the accumulative appearance incidence of high-transport (HT) state of peritoneal membrane. The mean D\/P creatinine in EPS group was significantly higher than that in the non EPS group in the course of PD from the 6th to the 10th year. The accumulative incidence of HT was significantly higher in the EPS group than in the non EPS group, indicating early development of HT membrane in EPS group. Early development of increased D\/P creatinine, classified as HT state, was observed during certain periods on PD in patients who developed EPS after PD withdrawal. That finding may indicate that HT state of peritoneal membrane is an early marker for EPS, and that the PET is useful to detect patients at high risk of EPS.","495":"Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is an important complication of peritoneal dialysis in which all or part of the intestine is enveloped in a fibrous ball resulting in a cocoon. Previously, we reported that acid dialysis solution (DS) induces peritoneal fibrosis. In the present study, we examined the effect of treatment with glucocorticoid (GC) in a model of EPS in rats. We divided 20 male Wistar-Kyoto rats into four groups and dialyzed them with various solutions for 40 days as follows: (1) pH 3.5 DS, 10 mL (pH 3.5, containing 1.35% glucose, n = 5); (2) pH 3.5 DS, 10 mL + GC (0.1 mg dexamethasone daily, n = 5); (3) pH 7.0 DS, 10 mL (n = 5); and (4) pH 7.0 DS, 10 mL + GC (n = 5). At the end of 40 days, all rats were humanely killed by decapitation. Expression of mRNA of aquaporins (AQPs) and glucose transporters (GLUTs) were studied by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction. In rats treated with pH 3.5 DS, necropsy findings showed evidence of EPS. The typical appearance was multiple surfaces covered with granulation tissue or fibrotic tissue or both. Multiple adhesions were present. Microscopic findings revealed that low-pH DS induced peritoneal fibrosis and loss of mesothelium. In the dialyzed rats, mRNA of AQP-1, AQP-4, GLUT-1, GLUT-4, and GLUT-5 was expressed in peritoneum. In rats treated with pH 3.5 DS, expression of AQPs was significantly suppressed and expression of GLUTs was significantly enhanced. However, glucocorticoid treatment prevented the progression of peritoneal fibrosis and adhesion of peritoneum. In rats treated with pH 7.0 DS, no signs of EPS were seen. Our study suggests that low-pH DS induced the development of EPS. Glucocorticoid protects against the development of EPS on peritoneal dialysis.","496":"Encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis (EPS) is recognized as a serious complication in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). We retrospectively studied the management of CAPD patients who developed EPS in 157 CAPD centers in Japan. Among 11,549 patients undergoing CAPD between 1980 and 2000 in 157 centers, 256 patients developed EPS. The EPS developed between 10 and 168 months (average: 99.6 months) after the start of CAPD. Of the 256 patients who developed EPS, 104 (40.6%) were using high glucose CAPD solution; however, 135 (52.7%) were not. Only 27 patients who developed EPS (10.5%) were using beta-blockers; many other patients were not. A history of peritonitis was seen in 232 patients (90.6%), but not in 11 other patients (4.3%). The average frequency of peritonitis before development of EPS was 3.3 times higher in patients who developed EPS than in those who did not. Various therapeutic approaches were tried with 101 of the patients who developed EPS. Steroid therapy, including pulse therapy, was used to treat 84 patients (83.2%), and total parenteral nutrition was used to treat 80 patients (79.2%). Total intestinal enterolysis was performed in 31 patients (30.7%). Immunosuppressive agents were used in only 8 patients (7.9%). After 2 years, 100 patients (39.1%) were known to have died; 143 (55.9%) patients were known to still be alive. The most important problem for the living EPS patients was their mental condition, especially depressive state. However, only 22 of 133 patients (16.5%) were able to consult with a counselor in the hospital. A mental health support system should be provided to EPS patients in Japan.","497":"Racial differences have been reported among various groups with end-stage renal disease maintained on dialysis. In particular, patient survival on dialysis has been reported to be better in African-American patients than in Caucasian patients. Peritonitis rates and dropout from chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) have been reported to be higher in African-American patients. We decided to review our experience with peritonitis rates in African-American and Caucasian patients. From 1994 to 2000, 403 patients were maintained on CPD in the New Haven continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) unit. Peritonitis rates were 1 episode in 14 patient-months in Caucasian patients and 1 episode in 13.6 patient-months in African-American patients. Mean ages at the start of dialysis were 52.4 +\/- 16.2 years in the Caucasian patients and 62.6 +\/- 14.9 years in the African-American patients. African-American patients were older. African-American and Caucasian patients had similar peritonitis rates. Time of first episode of peritonitis was not different in the two groups.","498":"The use of antibiotic prophylaxis before peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter insertion has been a matter of great interest for both the surgical and the nephrology community. No uniform consensus exists on the timing, duration, or choice of antibiotic prophylaxis. The exact incidence of early postoperative peritonitis is unknown. The impact of the use of antibiotic prophylaxis in the prevention of early PD peritonitis and in long-term catheter survival is not clear. In that respect, many retrospective and prospective studies have been undertaken in the past, and they have shown conflicting results. Based on extensive data from the surgical and nephrology literature, and also based on our experience, we present a review of the use of antibiotic prophylaxis before peritoneal dialysis catheter insertion.","499":"High transporters are defined based on the peritoneal equilibration test. Peritoneal transport rate changes over time, inflammation and angiogenesis affecting the total pore area. Factors influencing the neovascularization process are described. High transporters have distinctive clinical and laboratory features. The incidence of high transporters varies among different populations. Unfortunately, high transporters have the worst clinical outcomes. Mechanisms proposed to explain the adverse prognosis--including hypoalbuminemia, chronic fluid overload, malnutrition, and chronic inflammation--are discussed. We suggest dividing baseline high transporters into two groups: \"sick\" and \"healthy\" high transporters. The two types of high transporters have different baseline characteristics and different clinical outcomes. Hopefully, further studies will better define the appearance of the two groups of high transporters.","500":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD), despite being advantageous to patient, physician, and society, has failed to show the growth it deserves. On the contrary, PD utilization has declined. Over the past several years, we have noticed a decline in the number of our home dialysis patients. When compared to the national trend, we find our trend to be not significantly different from other centers across the country. A similar trend has also been noticed in Canada. Although several reasons may exist for the decline, we intend to concentrate on local factors. In the first quarter of 1996, we had a total of 46 adult and pediatric end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on PD. That number decreased to 23 at the end of fourth quarter of the year 2001. The losses in our program far exceeded the gains. We lost our patients mainly to in-center hemodialysis (ICHD) and to transplantation. Peritonitis and membrane failure remained the major grounds for the loss to ICHD. In our center, geographic location and a lack of structured pre-ESRD education probably played a major role in the decline. Many of our patients are from distant counties that have a contract with University of Texas Medical Branch for providing health care to their indigent population. However, once those patients develop complications, the counties rely on the expertise of local physicians and nephrologists.","501":"Patients treated with Extraneal peritoneal dialysis solution (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.) have a significant decrease in serum amylase activity. The decline is reported to be due to interference of icodextrin in a routinely used laboratory assay. The present study was designed to investigate the kinetics of icodextrin interference in the amylase activity assay and to determine whether assay interference can account for the total decline in amylase activity. Plasma obtained from healthy volunteers was spiked with 0, 0.21, 0.71, and 3.6 mg\/mL icodextrin. Amylase activity was determined using Sigma kit 577-10 (Sigma Diagnostics, St. Louis, MO, U.S.A.). Amylase activity in plasma samples spiked with 3.6 mg\/mL icodextrin was also monitored while varying the concentration of the substrate (ET-G7-PNP) from the assay kit. Amylase activity decreased with increasing amounts of icodextrin and decreasing amounts of assay substrate. A 72.6% decrease in amylase activity was observed in samples spiked with 3.6 mg\/mL icodextrin as compared with samples without icodextrin at a substrate level similar to that in the assay kit (0.71 mmol\/L). Double reciprocal and Dixon plots indicate competitive inhibition of amylase activity by icodextrin. Icodextrin functions as a competitive inhibitor in the assay for amylase activity, as predicted by the structural similarities between icodextrin and the amylase assay substrate. The degree of icodextrin interference suggests that the entire decline in amylase activity observed in patients using Extraneal can be accounted for qualitatively by icodextrin interference. The amylase activity decline in patients treated with Extraneal is an artifact attributable to assay interference.","502":"Icodextrin is a glucose polymer osmotic agent used to achieve sustained ultrafiltration during long peritoneal dialysis dwells. Previous assays for icodextrin in plasma and dialysate samples involved laborious methods, such as gel permeation chromatography with post-column derivatization of the eluted glucose polymers. We developed and validated a simple and more rapid assay for icodextrin using amyloglucosidase to hydrolyze all glucose polymers to glucose. Glucose was determined pre- and post-hydrolysis using a glucose hexokinase assay, and icodextrin concentration was calculated as the difference between glucose levels before and after hydrolysis. The complete hydrolysis of icodextrin to glucose was confirmed using anion exchange chromatography. Recovery studies using icodextrin powder added to plasma or dialysate showed 100% +\/- 15% recovery for plasma concentrations from 10 mg\/dL to 800 mg\/dL and for dialysate concentrations from 50 mg\/dL to 800 mg\/dL. The percent relative standard deviation (%RSD) based on multiple replicates was within 6%, except at plasma icodextrin concentrations of 10 mg\/dL and below. This simple and reliable assay has been used routinely in our laboratory to analyze thousands of plasma and dialysate samples from patients using Extraneal peritoneal dialysis solution (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.).","503":"Continuous flow peritoneal dialysis (CFPD) is a very promising modality of PD in terms of high rates of solute removal and ultrafiltration (UF). The published clinical data are characterized by marked variability in terms of clearances and UF. Analysis of those data suggest significant streaming and recirculation with the available double-lumen catheters. A new double lumen catheter is described. It has wide separation between the limbs to minimize streaming and recirculation, and a novel geometric configuration to maximize internal cross-sectional luminal area with the lowest external diameter. Preliminary in vitro studies have shown flow rates consistent with those required for CFPD, satisfactory mixing of the fluid, and minimal streaming and recirculation. Clinical validation with long-term studies are needed to assess the viability of CFPD as a chronic renal replacement therapy.","504":"The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) has been widely used as a standardized means for estimating solute transport. However, the procedure is rather complex, and patients must spend more than half a day in the hospital. The fast PET is an alternative method, but the results are not reliable in patients whose peritoneal catheters drain poorly. We postulated that patients could perform the PET at home if educated well about the procedure. To that purpose, we prepared three types of visual aids that introduce the PET procedure: a VCR tape, a DVD disc, and a brochure with photographs. Equilibration tests were performed using the twin-bag system. For making fluid level indicator lines (200 mL and 10 mL), patients are given a guide sheet on which the fresh dialysate bag is placed. After an 8- to 12-hour overnight dwell, the dwelled dialysate is drained completely into the empty bag. Immediately after the patient infuses 2 L of fresh 2.5% glucose dialysis solution, 200 mL of that solution is drained into the bag on which the two fluids levels were previously marked. After mixing, about 190 mL of the dialysate is re-infused, and the remaining 10 mL (the amount indicated by a guide mark at the corner) is left within the bag. After a 4-hour dwell, the dialysate is completely drained into another twin-bag. A standard PET was also performed on a different day, and the data were compared with those from the home PET. Significant correlations were seen in D\/D0 and in drain volume between the home PET and the standard PET (n = 10; D\/D0: 0.385 +\/- 0.054 vs. 0.371 +\/- 0.052 respectively, r = 0.872, p = 0.0004; drain volume: 2340 +\/- 123 mL vs. 2372 +\/- 90 mL respectively, r = 0.788, p = 0.0048). We conclude that the home PET is a clinically useful alternative to the standard PET, saving time and labor while maintaining accuracy.","505":"Temporary transfer to hemodialysis, as a peritoneal rest, may be a rescue therapy to recover ultrafiltration (UF) in patients who develop peritoneal hyperpermeability as a complication of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). However, peritoneal sclerosis has been reported after peritoneal pause. Since the beginning of our CAPD program in 1985, 12 elective peritoneal pauses have been performed in 11 patients who developed type I ultrafiltration failure (D\/P240 creatinine: 0.88 +\/- 0.09) after 42 +\/- 14 months on CAPD. Eight patients recovered UF and remained on CAPD with standard solutions for 10 +\/- 9 months more (minimum: 5 months; maximum: 29 months). Only 3 of those patients were later switched to hemodialysis because of recurring UF failure. One patient remains on CAPD (62 months of follow-up). Four patients failed to respond and were permanently transferred to hemodialysis, without signs of developing encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis. The failed pauses were performed later after the detection of UF failure than were the successful ones (483 +\/- 574 days vs. 54 +\/- 52 days). In our study, 8 of 12 peritoneal pauses (66.6%) successfully treated type I UF failure and prolonged CAPD retention. If a pause is initiated soon after diagnosis of UF failure, results may improve further. We urge prospective studies to better determine the best and timely therapeutic approach in patients with loss of ultrafiltration.","506":"The present study evaluates the influence of the preceding exchange on peritoneal equilibration test (PET) results in patients on automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). A standard PET was performed following a 24-hour CAPD period with a preceding long overnight dwell of 8-10 hours (PETST), and following the usual APD regimen with short overnight dwell (PETAPD). We evaluated 9 patients of mean age 59 +\/- 18 years. Mean time on peritoneal dialysis was 31 +\/- 17 months, and mean APD duration was 15 +\/- 11 months. Mean D\/P creatinine at 4 hours was 0.77 +\/- 0.12 (PETST) and 0.77 +\/- 0.13 (PETAPD, p = 0.901). Mean D\/D0 glucose was 0.33 +\/- 0.07 (PETST) and 0.36 +\/- 0.09 (PETAPD, p = 0.347). A significant correlation was seen between the D\/P creatinine ratios (r = 0.946, p &lt; 0.001) for the two PET methods and the D\/D0 glucose ratios (r = 0.554, p = 0.017) for the two PET methods. Transport classification did not change in any patient. The current data support the use of the PET for peritoneal membrane evaluation immediately after cycler therapy in APD patients. We suggest that there is no need to change the dialysis regimen to a long dwell for the preceding exchange to evaluate peritoneal membrane characteristics when D\/P creatinine and D\/D0 glucose ratios are measured.","507":"In peritoneal dialysis (PD), compliance with the dialytic prescription is an important element in achieving adequate dialysis. Using the questionnaire or inventory method, a rate of noncompliance between 10% and 20% has been reported for automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). The recent introduction of APD equipment capable of recording dialytic treatments (DTs) means that compliance can be assessed more precisely. In the present study, the PDLink software program (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.) was used to retrospectively analyze 3 consecutive months of DTs in 19 APD patients (15 men, 4 women; age: 67.9 +\/- 10.2 years; duration of PD: 36.3 +\/- 30.0 months) who were treated with the HomeChoice Pro [HCpro (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.)]. In 12 patients (63%), the treatment was self-administered; for the other 7 patients (37%), treatment was handled by a partner (spouse: 5; family member: 2). Of 1673 recorded DTs, 20 (1.2%) were not performed. In the period taken into consideration (90 consecutive days), 9 patients underwent all the prescribed sessions, 4 patients missed 1 session, 3 patients missed 2 sessions, 2 patients missed 3 sessions, and 1 patient missed 4 sessions. No irregularities were observed in relation to the prescribed volumes, and session length was 60-120 minutes shorter in only 0.12% of the recorded sessions. In conclusion, the HCpro system proved effective in assessing compliance. In our experience, noncompliance occurred in a lower percentage of cases than has previously been reported, notwithstanding the present method's greater sensitivity and lesser specificity.","508":"We evaluated the influence of a neutral peritoneal dialysis solution (PDS) on the peritoneum. The subjects were 10 stable PD patients using conventional PDS. We substituted pH-neutral PDS (PD Solita A: Shimizu Medical, Tokyo, Japan) for conventional PDS (Gambrosol A: Shimizu Medical). Effluent from 4-hour dwells was collected, and the appearance rate of cancer antigen 125 (CA125-AR) was calculated using the method of Pannekeet et al and corrected to body surface area. The dialysate-to-plasma creatinine (D\/P Cr) was obtained, and personal dialysis capacity (PDC) was evaluated at 3-month intervals. Mean daily ultrafiltration volumes did not significantly change when pH-neutral PDS was used. The mean CA125-AR obtained 1 month after substitution was twice as high as that before substitution (139.2 +\/- 47.3 U\/min\/1.73 m2 before substitution vs. 286 +\/- 126.2 U\/min\/1.73 m2 1 month later). However, mean values of CA125-AR were maintained at higher levels and did not significantly vary for 7 months after PD fluid substitution. When the change in CA125-AR (delta CA125-AR) was calculated as the ratio of the CA125-AR value before substitution to that after substitution at the respective measurement points, delta CA125-AR negatively correlated with D\/P Cr. However, none of % area, % absorption, or % plasma loss significantly correlated with the delta CA125-AR obtained 6 months later. Although mesothelial cell viability may increase with the use of pH-neutral PDS, the level of the increase may differ depending on the severity of peritoneal damage. In addition, the use of a neutral PD fluid did not improve the endothelial cell system. In the future, development of a novel osmotic pressure-regulating substance substituting for glucose is essential to the development of PD fluids with higher biocompatibility.","509":"The fundamental objective of dialysis is to maintain the dose of solute clearance and ultrafiltration (UF). When peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients cannot maintain the target dose of clearance [weekly Kt\/V &gt; 2.0, weekly creatinine clearance (CCr) &gt; 60 L\/1.73 m2], the dialysis dose needs to be increased. But the means of increasing the dose only by PD are limited, especially for patients with UF failure (UFF). Combination therapy--PD with hemodialysis (PD + HD)--is the simplest way to solve the problem. The purpose of PD + HD therapy is to support solute clearance and UF when PD alone cannot meet the necessary targets. Acute and transient dialysis cases should be excluded. The general prescription for PD + HD should be 5-6 days of PD weekly and 1 session of HD weekly. For determine the adequacy of PD + HD, we adopted the equivalent renal clearance (EKR), transforming the PD weekly Kt\/V and then evaluating total clearance from both modalities. Of our 238 dialysis patients, 31 (13%) use combined therapy. Except for 1 patient that transferred from long-term HD, all of patients had been on PD for more than 60 months, and were experiencing uremic symptoms after decline of residual renal function. In 12 cases, the problem was lack of solute clearance; in 5 cases, it was UFF. High permeability was involved in 5 cases: 4 after long-term PD and 1 from the start of PD. Poor self-management occurred in 9 cases. Contributing factors included hernia, diaphragmatic intercourse, and severe heart failure with strict fluid control. Among the 31 patients, 8 used HD twice weekly. After combination therapy was started, the dialysis dose increased and body fluids became controllable. As a result, uremic symptoms improved and the patients' quality of life increased.","510":"We performed a review of United States-based, English-language Web sites to evaluate the information on peritoneal dialysis (PD) available to patients via the Internet. The \"hits\" obtained after using the search term \"peritoneal dialysis\" on a series of health care Web sites were listed and reviewed. Information was classified as limited, brief summary, detailed, or extensive, in order of increasing information. Professional organizations dedicated to kidney disease provided extensive information on PD, but Web sites for consumers generally provided little information. Information regarding PD is available to patients on the Internet, but for the most detailed and accurate information, patients should be directed to sites provided by professional organizations that specialize in kidney disease.","511":"Numerous reports of quality-of-life data in chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) patients in the United States and Western Europe use the short form questionnaire (SF-36). Few centers in Europe have reported data examining the incidence of depression in CPD patients. Depression has been shown to correlate with morbidity and mortality in dialysis patients. A high incidence of clinical depression is seen in end-stage renal disease patients in the United States. We thought it could be important to compare depression measurements between the United States and European countries. Quality-of-life data of the peritoneal dialysis patients from the New Haven continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) unit and from the New Technology Center at Hospital #31 in St. Petersburg were compared. The Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) and the SF-36, which includes the mental component score (MCS) and the physical component score (PCS), were administered to the patients. The study participants included 147 Russian and 96 U.S. patients. The BDI, PCS, and MCS scores were similar in both groups. The BDI scores in the Russian patients indicated that a high incidence of clinical depression likely exists in that patient population. The utility of the BDI in assessing quality-of-life issues in Europe and Russia requires further evaluation.","512":"We retrospectively evaluated the phenomenon of arterial hypotension in peritoneal dialysis (PD) in a large cohort of 633 PD patients from two centers (Toronto Western Hospital, Toronto, Canada, and Division of Nephrology, Democritus University of Thrace, Greece), thus extending our previously reported experience for an additional 6 years (1995-2000). Together, the units had 81 hypotensive patients (12.8%), whose mean age was 63.8 +\/- 14.2 years and whose mean duration of peritoneal dialysis was 49.3 +\/- 30 months. Based on the underlying pathophysiology, the hypotensive PD patients were divided into four groups: (A) hypovolemia, 32 patients (39.5%); (B) congestive heart failure (CHF), 15 patients (18.5%); (C) receiving antihypertensive medications, 11 patients (13.6%); and (D) \"unknown\" etiology, 23 patients (28.4%). All patients in the hypovolemic and antihypertensive groups responded well to treatment (volume expansion and discontinuation of antihypertensive medication, respectively), but in the CHF and \"unknown\" groups, only 40% improved with the appropriate intervention. Patients in the latter two groups showed the poorest prognosis, with an approximate death rate of 65%. The hypovolemic group had better outcomes, which might reflect prompt response to fluid replacement in that group. We conclude that, in PD patients, careful use of antihypertensive medication, the right evaluation of target weight (especially in patients with cardiac failure), and judicious use of hypertonic exchanges may prevent the severe complication of arterial hypotension.","513":"The optimal time to start renal replacement therapy remains controversial. Residual renal function (RRF) and nutrition status being important prognostic factors, the present study evaluates the impact of timely start of peritoneal dialysis (PD) on their evolution. Our study used a prospective database on pre-end-stage renal disease patients at a tertiary care center. We included 18 patients who were planned to start PD at a GFR &gt; 8 mL\/min between 1 January and 31 December 1999. At the start of PD (month 0), creatinine clearance (CCr) was 11.3 +\/- 3.9 mL\/min, actual glomerular filtration rate (GFR) was 8.6 +\/- 3.3 mL\/min, and Kt\/V was 1.56 +\/- 0.65. The monthly declines of GFR and CCr before and after the start of PD were -0.47 +\/- 0.64 mL\/min (GFR) and -0.59 +\/- 0.46 mL\/min (CCr), and -0.06 +\/- 0.30 mL\/min (GFR) and -0.05 +\/- 0.39 mL\/min (CCr) respectively (p = 0.034 and 0.001, respectively). Before the start of PD, CCr was 21.9 +\/- 4.6 mL\/min (month -12) and 18.1 +\/- 4.8 mL\/min (month -6, p &lt; 0.001). After the start of PD, CCr was 12.0 +\/- 4.3 mL\/min (month 3), 11.5 +\/- 4.9 mL\/min (month 6), and 13.1 +\/- 5.4 mL\/min (month 12, p = 0.9). Serum albumin dropped until just before the start of PD: 3.89 +\/- 0.59 g\/dL (month -6) and 3.78 +\/- 0.51 g\/dL (month -3) versus 2.56 +\/- 1.60 g\/dL (month 0, p = 0.04). Serum albumin then increased to 3.42 +\/- 0.95 mg\/dL (month 3 after the start of PD) and 3.35 +\/- 0.86 mg\/dL (month 6 after the start of PD, p = 0.04). In the months preceding the start of PD, the normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) dropped from 1.41 +\/- 0.36 g\/kg daily (month -6) and 1.34 +\/- 0.46 g\/kg daily (month -3) to 1.12 +\/- 0.25 g\/kg daily (month 0). It then stabilized at 1.17 +\/- 0.25 g\/kg daily (month 3) and 1.18 +\/- 0.17 g\/kg daily (months 6). One patient died owing to a cerebrovascular accident after 18 months of PD, and one was transferred to hemodialysis because of ultrafiltration failure after 19 months of PD. During 264 patient-months, 14 peritonitis episodes occurred. Of the 14 episodes, 12 resolved without complication, and the catheter was replaced in 2 episodes. After timely start of PD, the rate of RRF decline decreases. Already, at a GFR &gt; 8 mL\/min, uremia has a negative impact on nutrition parameters. Timely initiation of PD could reverse the negative evolution of albumin and stop the decline of nPCR. No severe complications related to PD were seen. In view of the important impact of RRF and nutrition on patient outcome, our data may favor an early start of PD.","514":"To investigate the relationship between obesity, small-solute clearances, and nutrition in continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD), we compared clearances and nutrition indices between 270 obese and 502 normal-weight CPD patients. Degree of obesity was classified by the ratio of body weight (W) to desired weight (DW) at the first clearance study. The DWs were obtained from the tables of the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company, assuming a medium skeletal frame. The obese patients (group I) had W\/DW &gt; 1.2 (1.38 +\/- 0.17), and the normal-weight patients (group II) had 0.9 &lt; or = W\/DW &lt; or = 1.2 (1.05 +\/- 0.08). Nutrition indices derived from urea nitrogen and creatinine excretion were normalized by both W and DW. The following variables differed between group I (first value) and group II: sex (women: 48.2% vs. 33.9%), W (87.6 +\/- 14.4 kg vs. 68.2 +\/- 8.7 kg), body surface area (1.95 +\/- 0.22 m2 vs. 1.77 +\/- 0.16 m2), body water by method of Watson (41.2 +\/- 7.7 L vs. 36.3 +\/- 5.5 L), body mass index (31.8 +\/- 3.9 vs 24.3 +\/- 2.0), protein nitrogen appearance (PNA: 62.9 +\/- 17.6 kg in 24 h vs. 57.7 +\/- 15.7 kg in 24 h), PNA normalized to DW (1.08 +\/- 0.29 g\/kg in 24 h vs. 0.96 +\/- 0.26 g\/kg in 24 h), creatinine excretion (CrEx: 1111 +\/- 396 mg in 24 h vs. 991 +\/- 348 mg in 24 h), CrEx\/W (12.6 +\/- 3.7 g\/kg in 24 h vs. 15.4 +\/- 4.5 g\/kg in 24 h), CrEx\/DW (17.3 +\/- 5.3 g\/kg in 24 h vs. 15.1 +\/- 4.8 g\/kg in 24 h), lean body mass (LBM: 49.3 +\/- 13.8 kg vs. 43.6 +\/- 11.9 kg), LBM\/W (0.56 +\/- 0.12 vs. 0.64 +\/- 0.15), and LBM\/DW (0.77 +\/- 0.18 vs 0.67 +\/- 0.16), all at p &lt; or = 0.034. Marginal differences (0.10 &gt; p &gt; 0.05) were found in the diabetes prevalence (53.0% vs. 40.8%), height (165.9 +\/- 11.7 cm vs. 167.4 +\/- 9.8 cm), and serum albumin (3.64 +\/- 0.55 g\/dL vs. 3.53 +\/- 0.62 g\/dL). No differences were found in age, duration of CPD until the first clearance study, percent of subjects with anuria, Kt\/V urea, creatinine clearance, blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, and PNA normalized to W. Obese CPD patients tend to have better nutrition indices than do normal-weight CPD patients with similar small-solute clearances. In obese subjects, normalization by W creates inappropriately low values for nutrition indices derived from urea nitrogen and creatinine excretion. Normalization of those indices by DW appears preferable.","515":"Peritoneal permeability, evaluated using the peritoneal equilibration test (PET), indicates that, in an adult population not selected for age, an increase in the transport rate of small solutes usually occurs in the course of peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment. We evaluated the dialysate-to-plasma ratio of urea (D\/P urea), the D\/P creatinine, the ratio of dialysate glucose at a designated dwell time to dialysate glucose at 0 dwell time (D\/D0 glucose), and the mass transfer-area coefficients (KBDs) of those solutes in PETs performed in patients aged above or below 60 years who were matched for sex, PD duration, and outcome. The single-center, retrospective study was carried out in a peritoneal dialysis unit in a university hospital. Two groups of PD patients were chosen. Mean age of patients in group I (n = 21; 9 women, 12 men) was 67.7 +\/- 4.5 years; PD duration was 20.1 +\/- 12.1 months. In group II, the patients (n = 21; 9 women, 12 men) had a mean age of 42.8 +\/- 9.1 years, and had been treated with PD for 20.7 +\/- 12.1 months. A standard PET was performed according to Twardowski et al every 3 months from PD start to PD end. The first results, the mean results representing the entire PD course, and the last results were compared between groups. In addition, the first and the last results were compared within each group. No significant differences were seen between the groups in peritoneal transport in the first PET. In the last PET, the curves for D\/P urea and D\/P creatinine, and the KBD for urea, were significantly lower in the older patients than the curves obtained at PD start. In consequence, a tendency toward lower D\/P ratios or KBDs for urea and creatinine in the last and mean PETs was observed in group I as compared with group II. No significant changes were seen in the peritoneal transfer of glucose in the course of PD or between groups. Older patients may show a reduction in peritoneal permeability from the vascular to the mesothelial side of the membrane in the course of PD treatment; peritoneal transport in the opposite direction remains unchanged during approximately 20 months from the start of PD treatment. The patients under 60 years of age maintain stable bi-directional permeability under a comparable PD duration.","516":"Previous theoretic and clinical studies have shown that continuous flow peritoneal dialysis (CFPD) provides a high dose of small-solute removal; however, the dose of middle-molecule removal with CFPD therapy has not been evaluated. We used a variable-volume, two-compartment model to calculate theoretical steady-state solute kinetic profiles during CFPD, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and hemodialysis using a high-flux dialyzer (HFHD), for an anuric 70-kg patient and two measures of dose: equivalent renal clearance (EKR) and standard Kt\/V (stdKt\/V). Dose measures during each therapy were calculated for five solutes: urea, creatinine, vitamin B12, inulin, and beta 2-microglobulin. Fluid (1 L daily) was assumed to accumulate in and to be removed from the extracellular space, and non renal clearance was assumed to be zero for all solutes except beta 2-microglobulin. Calculated doses for CFPD were higher than for CAPD or HFHD when assessed by either EKR or stdKt\/V. Dose enhancements for CFPD were highest for small solutes, but were still considerable for middle molecules. We conclude that CFPD achieves higher doses than CAPD or HFHD for both small-solute and middle-molecule removal.","517":"In the past, we had observed that infusion of normal saline into the peritoneal cavity stimulates an inflammatory response. In the present study, we examined what effect the addition of glucose to normal saline would have on the peritoneal inflammatory response and change in peritoneal morphology. After catheter implantation, rats were infused intraperitoneally (i.p.) for 3 days with Dianeal 1.36% (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.). Dialysate samples were collected on day 3 after a 4-hour dwell. Next, rats were exposed to either NaCl (n = 7) or NaCl with glucose 250 mmol\/L (Glu, n = 7) twice daily for 4 weeks. After 2 weeks and 4 weeks of the study, dialysate samples were collected after a 4-hour dwell to analyze the activity of inflammatory reaction. At the end of the experiment, imprints of peritoneal mesothelium were taken. Control animals (C, n = 6) did not undergo catheter implantation or the dialysis procedure. The inflammatory reaction--cell count, cell differentiation, nitric oxide production, protein loss, and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1) concentration in dialysate expressed as a percentage of the initial value--did not change during the study in rats exposed to NaCl. On the other hand, in Glu-treated animals, the protein concentration was decreased after 4 weeks of the study (74% +\/- 23%, p &lt; 0.05), as was MCP-1 (24% +\/- 12%, p &lt; 0.05). The nitrites concentration was decreased after 2 weeks (72% +\/- 19%; p &lt; 0.05). Intraperitoneal adhesions were found in 6 rats of the NaCl group (86%) and in only 4 rats (57%) of Glu group. In the NaCl rats, a higher density of mesothelial cells was observed (2792 +\/- 510 cells\/mm2) as compared with Glu rats (2028 +\/- 561 cells\/mm2; p &lt; 0.05) and with control rats (1629 +\/- 422 cells\/mm2, p &lt; 0.05). The NaCl group also showed a higher nucleus: cytoplasm surface ratio (0.25 +\/- 0.03) as compared with the Glu group (0.18 +\/- 0.02, p &lt; 0.01) and with the control group (0.14 +\/- 0.01, p &lt; 0.01). Addition of glucose to normal saline suppresses the peritoneal inflammatory response and mesothelial hyperplasia occurring with intraperitoneal infusion of NaCl solution alone.","518":"Nitric oxide is an important factor in the regulation of vasodilator tone. In vascular cells, NO is synthesized by endothelial nitric oxide synthase, a key enzyme of the endogenous vasodilator system. Some studies have described the interaction between NO and the other factors that promote vasodilatation in vascular smooth muscular cells. Some of those factors are angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE), transforming growth factor beta (TGF beta), and endothelial oxide nitric synthase (eNOS). Polymorphism that can alter the expression or the function of the eNOS protein has been identified in the eNOS gene in the promoter and codification zones. We studied the Glu298Asp variant of the eNOS gene in 52 hemodialysis (HD) patients, 22 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, and 93 healthy controls. Identification of the Glu298Asp variant in exon 7 was performed by enzymatic amplification and restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis. The frequencies of eNOS genotypes in the control group were GG, 39.8%; GT, 43%; and TT, 17.2%. In HD patients, the frequencies were GG, 40.3%; GT, 38.7%; and TT, 21.7%. In PD patients, they were GG, 41.6%; GT, 50%; and TT, 8.6%. No significant differences were seen between the control group and the dialysis patients, or between the HD and the PD patients.","519":"Inflammatory status is observed in patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). The relationship between oxygen free radical production and dialysis could play an important role in protein oxidation. Carbonyl protein plasma level is an important tool in the study of protein stress, and it is related to the arterial intima thickness in the atherosclerosis process. We studied protein oxidative stress in 21 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and 42 hemodialysis (HD) patients as compared with 32 undialyzed patients with CRF. Carbonyl protein plasma levels were measured in nanomoles per milligram protein by the ELISA method (Winterbourn et al). Dialysis patients had a higher protein carbonyl content than did CRF patients (0.1265 +\/- 0.04 nmol\/mg vs. 0.1594 +\/- 0.03 nmol\/mg, p &lt; 0.0002). Patients on PD had a lower level than patients on HD (0.1452 +\/- 0.03 nmol\/mg vs. 0.1665 +\/- 0.04, p &lt; 0.004). Glucose administration in PD is known to be able to increase glucose degradation products (GDPs) and advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs) with high carboxylic and oxidative stress. In our study, the carbonyl protein level was higher in HD patients than in PD patients, perhaps because more protein oxidative stress is associated with hemodialysis technique or because the PD patients had greater residual renal function.","520":"Based on previous work, we hypothesized that the alterations in tissue hyaluronan concentration ([HA]) brought about by chronic treatment of the peritoneum would result in corresponding changes in solute and water transport. To address that hypothesis, we carried out daily intraperitoneal (i.p.) injections for 2 months in 200-300 g rats of 30-40 mL of a sterile solution via peritoneal catheter tunneled to a subcutaneous port in the neck. Solutions used were: 4% N-acetylglucosamine (NAG), 4% mannitol (M), 4% glucose (G), and control group (C). After 2 months, each animal underwent transport studies, using plastic chambers affixed to the parietal peritoneum of the abdominal wall, to determine: small-solute mass, osmotic filtration, and albumin flux in response to 450-500 mOsm\/kg. After each animal was humanely killed, the tissue below the chamber was removed and analyzed for [HA]. A 50% enhancement in [HA] in tissue was seen in NAG-treated animals as compared with animals in the other groups. Results for small-solute transport (one-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.6) and osmotic filtration (one-way ANOVA, p &gt; 0.2) both demonstrated no significant differences among groups. The albumin flux (mean +\/- standard error of the mean) in the control group (C) was significantly higher (0.36 +\/- 0.03 microL\/min\/cm2) than in the three treatment groups, but no difference was seen among the treatment groups (NAG: 0.25 +\/- 0.03 microL\/min\/cm2; M: 0.26 +\/- 0.03 microL\/min\/cm2; G: 0.29 +\/- 0.03 microL\/min\/cm2; one-way ANOVA, p = 0.064). We conclude that increasing [HA] by 50% in parietal peritoneal tissue does not bring about major changes in transperitoneal transport.","521":"Estimation of lymphocyte subset counts (SLCs) is a useful tool in diagnosing nutrition and immune changes in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Administration of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) or angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) can influence SLCs. Our aim was to evaluate the relationship between rHuEPO and ACEI doses and SLCs in the course of CAPD. In the group of studied patients (n = 55), 34 patients were taking rHuEPO and 38 patients were taking ACEIs. In 35 patients, enalapril was the ACEI used. Seven patients were taking rHuEPO, but not ACEIs; 11 patients were taking ACEIs, but not rHuEPO; 27 patients were taking rHuEPO and ACEIs both; and 10 patients were receiving neither rHuEPO nor ACEIs. Flow cytometry was used to estimate CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD16 + 56 antigens. In the study group, a correlation was seen between dialysis duration and rHuEPO dose (r = 0.395). No correlation was seen between CAPD duration and ACEI dose, but it was seen for total rHuEPO and ACEI doses (r = 0.327). A negative correlation was also seen between dialysis duration and CD19 cell count (r = -0.313). In patients taking only ACEIs (n = 11), a negative correlation was seen between total ACEI doses and CD16 + 56 cell count (r = -0.710). In patients who were not receiving rHuEPO or ACEIs, negative correlations were seen between dialysis duration and total lymphocyte count (r = -0.727), CD3 cell count (r = -0.706), CD4 cell count (r = -0.636), and CD8 cell count (r = -0.764). In conclusion, rHuEPO and ACEIs can influence the total lymphocyte count or lymphocyte subset counts--the natural changes being disturbed with prolongation of CAPD treatment. The possibility of this influence should be taken into account when evaluating lymphocyte counts as indices of nutrition and immune status.","522":"Carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) is used as a marker of bone formation and, presumably, also peritoneal fibrosis. The aim of the present study was to assess the effect of dialysate PICP level (PICPd) on serum PICP level (PICPs). The study group consisted of 20 patients divided into two groups: group A consisted of 10 children without peritonitis, mean age 13.6 +\/- 5 years, 3 on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and 7 on automated peritoneal dialysis (APD); and group B consisted of 10 children with peritonitis (last episode having occurred at least 2 months before the study), mean age 13.9 +\/- 2 years, 8 on CAPD and 2 on APD. Osmolarity of the dialysate fluid in groups A and B was similar (375.7 +\/- 42 mOsm\/L and 363.1 +\/- 16 mOsm\/L respectively). The PICPs and PICPd levels, PICP index (PICPd\/PICPs), PICP peritoneal clearance (ClPICP), and PICP mass transfer (MTPICP) were measured in both groups. Mean PICPs was higher in group B, but the difference was not significant. No significant differences were seen in the mean values of PICPd, PICP index, ClPICP, and MTPICP between groups. Levels of PICPd correlated positively with ClPICP (r = 0.75, p &lt; 0.001) and negatively with MTPICP (r = -0.89, p &lt; 0.0001). No associations were seen between PICPs and PICPd, ClPICP, and MTPICP. No associations were observed between osmolarity and ClPICP and MTPICP. Serum PICP level in children undergoing peritoneal dialysis does not depend on peritoneal PICP level.","523":"","524":"This article describes our five-year experience of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with bag exchanges performed without use of a face mask. The study took place in the renal unit at a university hospital. All patients admitted to the CAPD program from February 1995 to March 2000 were trained to perform bag exchanges without use of a face mask. Occurrence of peritonitis episodes was the outcome of interest. We evaluated 94 patients (52 women, 42 men) with a mean age of 48 +\/- 21 years and a total follow-up of 50,502 patient-days. During that time, 79 episodes of peritonitis occurred in 46 patients, for a peritonitis rate of 0.57 episodes\/year. The most frequently isolated micro-organisms were Staphylococcus epidermidis in 20 patients (25.3%) and S. aureus in 11 patients (13.9%). Renal transplantation was the major cause of drop-out [23 patients (43.4%)], followed by peritonitis [14 patients (26.4%)], death due to cardiovascular complications [9 patients (17.0%)], loss of ultrafiltration [2 patients (3.8%)], and other causes [5 patients (9.4%)]. The probability of being free of peritonitis at 12 months was 0.60, and at 60 months, 0.37. Peritonitis rates during the study period were not different from those reported by other centers, supporting the hypothesis that routine use of a face mask during CAPD bag exchange may be unnecessary.","525":"Abdominal catastrophe, defined as peritonitis from a visceral source, occurs in a significant number of patients treated by peritoneal dialysis. Peritonitis due to visceral injury is difficult to manage and is associated with high morbidity and mortality. Surgical intervention for both diagnosis and repair is definitive. However, no preventive strategy has been identified to date. The experience at University Hospitals of Cleveland and the published experiences of many other centers demonstrate that the risk of this complication has not changed in parallel with the many other improvements in the technique and outcome of peritoneal dialysis. We propose an approach to improve the understanding and outcome of this devastating complication. First, classification of peritonitis by source, not by organism, may lead to a more focused response to each episode of peritonitis. Second, the importance of antibiotic prophylaxis should be re-assessed in defined clinical settings that have a high likelihood of progressing to abdominal catastrophe. Third, optimal antibiotic regimens need to be devised and applied when visceral injury is highly suspected as a cause of peritonitis. Finally, the results of surgical interventions must be carefully studied.","526":"This study evaluates the cost-effectiveness of laparoscopic implantation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters as compared with insertion by open dissection. The cost analysis was based on clinical experience with 232 consecutive implants and 23 procedures to rescue catheters from flow dysfunction. Institutional expenses were calculated from the costs of labor and of disposable and reusable materials. Payer costs were taken from Medicare reimbursement schedules for outpatient, inpatient, professional, and ancillary services. A break-even percentage was calculated, representing the point at which the laparoscopic procedure became cost-effective because of a lower incidence of costly catheter rescue procedures. An observed difference in the incidence of catheter obstruction between laparoscopic and open procedures exceeding this percentage would indicate that the laparoscopic approach was cost effective. The calculated break-even value varied between 1.5% and 26% depending on whether the procedures were performed exclusively on an inpatient or outpatient basis. Given our inpatient\/outpatient case mix, a weighted calculation of the break-even value was 9.4%. The observed difference in incidence between the two implant methods was 10.8% overall and 16.4% for the last 91 consecutive laparoscopic procedures. The analysis demonstrates that our laparoscopic implantation procedure is a cost-effective means of establishing PD access as compared with the open dissection technique.","527":"Controversy still exists as to whether peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment can be safely continued after herniotomy. Many nephrologists withhold PD treatment for several weeks after herniotomy for fear of dialysate leakage and hernia recurrence. Here, we report on 9 patients (2 women, 7 men) in whom herniotomy was performed for umbilical (n = 3), inguinal (n = 5), or cicatricial hernia (n = 2), or for open processus vaginalis (n = 2). Surgery was performed according to the Lichtenstein method with insertion of a polypropylene mesh and ligation of the hernia sac. In all patients, PD treatment was paused for the day of surgery and for 1-3 days postoperatively, depending on residual renal function. Over the next several days, low-volume (1.0-1.5 L), high-frequency (6 per day) exchanges were started. The patient's original PD regimen was gradually reinstated over the next 2-4 weeks. All patients recovered rapidly, with no uremia or dialysis-related complications. Particularly, no leakage and no hernia recurrence could be observed 3 months thereafter. None of the patients had to be hemodialyzed intercurrently. In conclusion, continuing a modified regimen of CAPD treatment after herniotomy seems to be safe, with excellent patient comfort.","528":"Glucose absorption from peritoneal dialysis solutions causes a chronic stimulation of insulin secretion, which leads to hyperinsulinism. The use of solutions without glucose should correct this metabolic derangement together with the associated cardiovascular risk. To verify this hypothesis, we studied the entire non diabetic continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) population of our center: 27 patients with a mean age of 62 +\/- 15 years, and a median 17 months on treatment. Morning fasting serum insulin was 32.8 +\/- 9.3 microU\/mL; glucose, 104.4 +\/- 21.8 mg\/dL; triglycerides, 162.4 +\/- 125.7 mg\/dL; cholesterol, 221.9 +\/- 54.7 mg\/dL; intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), 212 +\/- 189 pg\/mL; fibrinogen, 519 +\/- 112 mg\/dL; body mass index, 24.1 +\/- 4.1; and daily erythropoietin subcutaneous therapy dose, 17 +\/- 6 U\/kg. Insulin sensitivity, measured as ISI-HOMA (insulin sensitivity index, derived from the homeostasis model assessment) was 2.4 +\/- 0.7. Daily glucose load, calculated from dialytic schedules, was 135 +\/- 38 g. Of the 27 patients, 12 were treated with standard glucose solutions during the day and with one icodextrin dwell during the night for a median of 9 months (range: 1-28). The remaining 15 patients were treated with standard glucose solutions. The icodextrin group showed significantly lower serum insulin levels (28.6 +\/- 6.0 microU\/mL vs 36.1 +\/- 10.2 microU\/mL, p = 0.021) and significantly higher ISI-HOMA values (2.7 +\/- 0.5 vs 2.2 +\/- 0.7, p = 0.041) than the control group. The two groups showed no significant differences for glucose, triglycerides, cholesterol, iPTH, fibrinogen, body mass index, or erythropoietin therapy dose. Daily glucose load was lower in the icodextrin group, but without reaching statistical significance (128 +\/- 31 g vs 142 +\/- 43 g). This study shows, in a preliminary way, that the chronic use of icodextrin in the long nighttime dwell can reduce serum insulin levels and increase insulin sensitivity in CAPD patients.","529":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients are classified as underweight, normal weight, or obese by height\/weight indices including body mass index (BMI) and the body weight\/desired weight (W\/DW) ratio. We compared these classifications of degree of obesity in 378 women and 555 men on PD. We used these cut-off values: for underweight, BMI &lt; or = 18.5 and W\/DW &lt; or = 0.9; for obesity, BMI &gt; or = 30.0 and W\/DW &gt; or = 1.2. The W\/DW values were calculated assuming first a small frame, then a medium frame, and finally a large frame for all subjects. Regardless of sex or skeletal frame, BMI correlated highly with W\/DW (r value between 0.98 and 0.99); however, the range of BMI values corresponding by linear regression to the normal range of W\/DW (0.9-1.2) was narrower than the range of \"normal\" BMI (18.5-30.0). Consequently, regardless of sex or skeletal frame, smaller fractions of the patient population were classified as underweight or obese by BMI standards than by W\/DW standards. The degree of agreement of the classifications of subjects as underweight, normal weight, or obese by BMI and W\/DW was evaluated by Cohen's kappa ratio. The kappa ratio varied between 0.47 and 0.58, indicating a reasonable--but not high--degree of agreement beyond chance. The highest kappa ratios were obtained assuming a medium skeletal frame for both women and men. Substantial discrepancies are observed in the classification of PD patients as underweight, normal weight, or obese by BMI and W\/DW. Further research is needed to identify the height\/weight index that has the strongest association both with clinical outcomes and with other, more precise measurements of body fat content.","530":"This paper assesses the variation in total drainage time (TDT) and number of alarms due to low drainage volume (LDV) in automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) patients with varying catheter performance. Catheter performance was measured by drainage break point (DBP) in a supine position. Six patients with DBP &gt; or = 80% underwent three types of APD: non tidal, 50% tidal, and 80% tidal. Six patients with DBP &lt; 70% underwent two types of APD: non tidal and tidal fixed at 5% below DBP. In every case, the fill volume was 2.3 L. For the purpose of the study, each treatment was continued for seven consecutive nights. Home Choice Pro (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, Illinois, U.S.A.) was used to calculate the TDT and LDV. With both the non tidal and tidal treatments, TDT was higher in patients with DBP &lt; 70% as compared with patients with DBP &gt; or = 80%. In the latter group, 50% tidal was the most effective technique in reducing TDT. In patients with DBP &lt; 70%, the tidal treatment reduced not only TDT, but also LDV alarms, as compared to the non tidal treatment. In conclusion, choosing the tidal method helps to reduce LDV alarms and TDT, especially in patients with a low DBP. The Home Choice Pro device is an effective aid in setting up and assessing the dialytic prescription.","531":"The present study evaluated the inhibiting effect of various chemicals on the advanced glycation end-product (AGEs) cross-linking caused in protein by glucose degradation products (GDPs). We evaluated a few dozen organic and inorganic chemicals--in addition to previously reported AGE inhibitors, such as thiazolium derivatives and aminoguanidine--for their inhibiting effect. Collagen IV (from human placenta) or human serum albumin (HSA) was incubated with an AGE accelerator and one of the selected chemicals in phosphate buffer solution at 37 degrees C for as long as 14 days. Fluorescence intensity (440 nm) was determined after a given incubation time. Among 36 chemicals tested, 8 new chemicals and 5 previously known AGE inhibitors significantly suppressed the increase in fluorescence intensity seen after incubation of HSA with methylglyoxal. We believe that 6 chemicals may effectively quench GDPs and inhibit AGE cross-link formation, in a manner different from that of aminoguanidine and thiazolium.","532":"Peritoneal mesothelial cells are easily detached during conventional tissue processing, which may result in artifacts in peritoneal tissue examination. Therefore, in the present study, we investigated several methods to improve the preservation of the anterior parietal peritoneal tissues. Peritoneal tissue from the anterior abdominal wall was taken from each of 5 rats killed for the experiment. Tissue samples were immediately treated by one of these methods: (1) fixed with 10% formaldehyde; (2) fixed with Bouin's solution; (3) fixed with Helly's solution. After fixation, the samples were dehydrated with one of (a) ethanol, 1 hour in each step; (b) ethanol, 15 minutes in each step; or (c) tertiarybutyl alcohol. Five sections were taken from each tissue and stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The quality of tissue fixation was evaluated by image analysis. Peritoneal mesothelial cells were well preserved after fixation with Helly's solution or Bouin's solution. With 10% formaldehyde, about 40% of the mesothelial cells were lost. Dehydration with ethanol--especially long-duration dehydration--increased the loss. However, dehydration with tertiarybutyl alcohol avoided the increased loss of mesothelial cells. The submesothelial extracellular matrix was well preserved with Bouin's solution, but not with the other fixatives. Our results suggest that fixation with formaldehyde and dehydration with ethanol results in significant loss of peritoneal mesothelial cells and submesothelial extracellular matrix in peritoneal tissues. Fixation with Bouin's solution and dehydration with tertiary-butyl alcohol may be a better method of preserving peritoneal tissue.","533":"Anemia is common in dialysis patients. Change in phospholipids asymmetry in red blood cells (RBCs) may affect the removal of RBCs from the circulation and thus shorten the lifespan of RBCs. In the present study, we investigated phospholipids asymmetry in RBCs in uremic patients and its relationship with anemia. We studied 34 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients (age: 51 +\/- 15 years), 73 hemodialysis (HD) patients (age: 48 +\/- 12 years), 8 pre-dialysis renal-failure patients (age: 42 +\/- 21 years), and 16 healthy controls (age: 32 +\/- 9 years). All patients were clinically stable. Phospholipids asymmetry as measured by phosphatidylserine exposure was determined by a flow-cytometric annexin V-binding assay. Hemoglobin levels were 93 +\/- 20 g\/L, 83 +\/- 17 g\/L, 78 +\/- 21 g\/L, and 145.8 +\/- 12.5 g\/L for CAPD patients, pre-dialysis patients, HD patients, and healthy controls respectively. Phosphatidylserine exposure in RBCs was significantly higher in uremic patients as compared with healthy controls, especially in HD patients--whose values were significantly higher than values seen in CAPD patients and pre-dialysis patients. No significant difference was seen in RBC phosphatidylserine exposure between pre-dialysis patients and CAPD patients. Cells positive for annexin V binding were 1.58%, 1.40%, 2.11%, and 0.71% for CAPD patients, pre-dialysis patients, HD patients, and healthy controls respectively. Significant reverse correlations were seen between annexin V and hemoglobin (r = -0.381, p &lt; 0.001), and between annexin V and hematocrit (r = -0.355, p &lt; 0.001). Our results suggest that (1) anemia is common in our uremic patients, especially in HD patients; and (2) anemia in uremic patients may be partly related to the loss of phospholipids asymmetry in RBCs.","534":"The present study investigated variation in apoptosis and proliferation, and the balance between apoptosis and proliferation, for peritoneal mesothelial cells (MCs) after exposure to peritoneal dialysis solution (PDS) in vivo. We implanted 32 male Sprague-Dawley rats (4 groups; n = 8 in each group) with catheters and intraperitoneally infused the animals with 20 mL Dianeal 1.36%, 2.27%, or 3.86% (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.) PDS twice daily for eight consecutive weeks, using saline as a control. At the end of the eighth week, samples of peritoneal membrane were fixed and sliced. Expression of apoptosis was checked with TUNEL kits (Boehringer Mannheim, Mannheim, Germany), and expression of proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) was checked by immunohistochemistry [streptoavidin-biotin-peroxidase complex (SABC) method]. The ratio of MC apoptosis to proliferation was measured from the same slices using the dual-stain combination of TUNEL and SABC. Cells positive for apoptosis and PCNA were counted for all samples by light microscopy in 50 consecutive grids (10 x by 40). Peritoneal dialysis solution was found to significantly induce MC apoptosis as compared with control at the end of the eighth week. The degree of apoptosis was proportional to the concentration of glucose in the PDS. The 1.36% PDS, but not the 2.27% or 3.86%, significantly stimulated the expression of PCNA. The degree of PCNA expression was negatively related to the glucose concentration of the PDS. The MC apoptosis: PCNA ratio was significantly higher for 3.86% and 2.27% PDS than for the control, but no significant difference was seen between 1.36% PDS and control. We conclude that glucose-based PDS may induce apoptosis and disturb the balance of MC apoptosis and proliferation, and that 1.36% PDS damages the balance less than does 2.27% or 3.86% PDS. These effects may be partly due to pH, calcium, hyperosmolality, and glucose degradation products (GDPs). Loss of balance between MC proliferation and apoptosis--induced by unphysiologic PDS--may be one of the major causes of peritoneal membrane failure during long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis.","535":"The present study looked for variations in blood morphology between diabetic patients (group I, n = 7) and non diabetic patients (group II, n = 16) treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). A subsequent trial sought to find a reason for discrepancies in the results between the two groups. The patients in both groups and similar ages, CAPD durations, and erythropoietin dosages. Nutrition, CAPD adequacy, serum iron and ferritin levels, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), transferrin saturation (TSAT), red blood cells (RBCs), mean corpuscular hemoglobin (MCH), mean corpuscular volume (MCV), mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (MCHC), hemoglobin (Hb), hematocrit (Hct), white blood cells (WBCs), total lymphocyte count (TLC), platelets (PLTs), and serum intact parathyroid hormone (PTH) were evaluated every three months. The mean result of each parameter was obtained in every patient as representative for the entire CAPD course. Means and standard deviations for all respective parameters were then calculated for the two groups and compared. In patients with diabetes as compared with patients without diabetes, significantly higher numbers of RBCs, WBCs, and PLTs were seen, as were higher values for Hb and Hct and a lower serum PTH concentration. Values for WBCs, PLTs, and MCH obtained in all patients (n = 23) were correlated with serum intact PTH (r = -0.520, p = 0.011; r = -0.422, p = 0.045; and r = -0.436, p = 0.037 respectively). When data obtained in the patients receiving erythropoietin were excluded and the correlation analysis was repeated for the 10 remaining patients, a correlation between serum PTH and RBCs was found (r = -0.685, p = 0.029). With comparable age, renal function, nutrition, erythropoietin dosage, iron indices, and CAPD adequacy, duration, and outcome, higher parameters of blood morphology in diabetic patients may be related to lower levels of serum intact PTH, indicating no or only mild secondary hyperparathyroidism. Patients with diabetes usually show smaller disturbances in PTH level than do non diabetic uremic patients on CAPD. Better peripheral morphology indices in the group with diabetes can be expected when other factors affecting hematologic status are similar.","536":"Aquaporin-1 (AQP-1) has been reported to play an important role in peritoneal dialysis. To determine the precise mechanism involved, we used cultured rat peritoneal mesothelial cells (RPMCs) to examine the translocation of AQP-1 to the plasma membrane induced by hyperosmotic stimuli. Cultured RPMCs obtained from male Sprague-Dawley rats were incubated at room temperature in Dulbecco modified Eagle medium\/F12 (DMEM\/F12) with and without glucose or mannitol as the hyperosmotic stimulus. The plasma membrane was then extracted by the Percoll gradient method. Finally, the abundance AQP-1 molecules in the membrane fraction was determined by Western blot analysis. Significant enhancement of AQP-1 abundance (p &lt; 0.05) was observed within 2.5 minutes of the addition of 5% glucose to the medium. The increase was sustained in its abundance through 15 minutes. Abundance of AQP-1 was also increased (p &lt; 0.05) by the addition of 5% mannitol. These results suggest that hyperosmotic stimuli could generate increased AQP-1 abundance in the plasma membrane by translocation of AQP-1 protein from recycling endosomes or early endosomes to the plasma membrane, rather than by protein synthesis via newly expressed mRNA. The latter mechanism would be expected to take more time.","537":"Phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), an isotonic solution with a physiologic pH can be considered an example of a biocompatible dialysis fluid. This study compared the biocompatibility of PBS with that of Dianeal 3.86% (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.), using a model of peritoneal dialysis in the rat. In an acute experiment, after catheter implantation, rats were infused on day 1 with PBS, on day 5 with standard dialysis solution (Dianeal 3.86%), and on day 7 again with PBS. When rats were injected with Dianeal 3.86%, the inflammatory reaction was suppressed as compared with PBS. The cell count was lower with Dianeal (-85%, p &lt; 0.001), the neutrophil:macrophage ratio in dialysate was 80% lower (p &lt; 0.01), total protein concentration in the Dianeal dialysate was 73% lower (p &lt; 0.01), and the dialysate nitrite level was 45% lower (p &lt; 0.01). In a chronic experiment, after catheter implantation, rats were dialyzed for four weeks with PBS or with Dianeal 3.86%. At the end of the study, a 1-hour peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was performed. As evaluated on a semiquantitative scale, macroscopic changes in the peritoneum were more severe in rats exposed to PBS than in those exposed to Dianeal 3.86% (8.6 +\/- 3.2 vs 5.2 +\/- 2.6, p &lt; 0.05). The thickness of the visceral peritoneum was comparable in both groups; but, in PBS-treated rats, the peritoneal interstitium contained more inflammatory cells and more new vessels. During the 1-hour PET, peritoneal permeability to water and solutes was comparable in the two groups. Despite a more physiologic composition, PBS is a less biocompatible peritoneal dialysis solutions than is standard, acidic, hypertonic dialysis solution.","538":"Peritoneal membrane suffers structural and functional changes over time on peritoneal dialysis (PD)--in part, owing to the dialysis solutions currently used. Low pH seems to be an important element associated with solution bioincompatibility. Bicarbonate-containing fluids open new perspectives on this issue. The present study compared the effects of bicarbonate\/lactate (Bic\/Lac) solution (25 mmol\/L bicarbonate, 15 mmol\/L lactate) and lactate (Lac) solution (40 mmol\/L lactate) on mesothelial cell (MC) growth in culture. Eight stable PD patients were asked to collect peritoneal effluent from an 8-hour dwell on two separate days, within an interval shorter than one week. For the first dwell, Lac solution was infused; for the second dwell, Bic\/Lac solution was instilled. Human MCs were isolated from the effluent, seeded in 25-cm2 tissue culture flasks, and grown ex vivo. Morphology of the cells was also evaluated. In all effluents, MCs were present in mean amounts of 26,939 +\/- 21,267 cells (Bic\/Lac) and 25,986 +\/- 15,286 cells [Lac, p = nonsignificant (NS)]. Morphology of the MCs was similar with both solutions (87.5% typical). After initial culture, MCs from 6 patients using Bic\/Lac (75%) and 3 patients using Lac (37.5%) reached confluence. At this time, the number of MCs from the 3 patients who showed MC growth with both solutions was slightly higher with Bic\/Lac-buffered fluid (Lac: 1,154,125 +\/- 213,333 cells; Bic\/Lac: 1,198,291 +\/- 806,713 cells). To summarize: 3 patients showed MC growth under both solutions; 3 patients showed MC growth only under Bic\/Lac solution; and 2 patients showed no MC growth at all. After cells were seeded in 24-well plates, the MC growth curve was performed in 4 cases of Bic\/Lac solution use and in 3 cases of Lac solution use. Although no significant differences were observed between the solutions, the final number of MCs obtained was higher with Bic\/Lac solution use. In conclusion, MCs released into peritoneal effluent under bicarbonate\/lactate-buffered peritoneal dialysis solution are associated with a greater ex vivo proliferation capacity than those released under lactate solution in the same patient. This finding may demonstrate better biocompatibility for Bic\/Lac solution.","539":"Studies in the uremic rat indicate that insulin resistance and glucose intolerance leading to dyslipidemia are associated with a hyperparathyroid-induced increase in cytosolic calcium ([Ca++i]). These alterations are reversed with verapamil, but recur after discontinuation of the drug, suggesting that increased [Ca++i] is responsible for the metabolic derangement. To our knowledge, no similar studies have been conducted in humans. We retrospectively examined, over 12-year period, the effects of factors that lower [Ca++i] on total serum cholesterol and triglycerides in 176 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Because the study was retrospective, detailed lipid profiles were not available. We therefore relied on the morbidity and mortality outcome related to atherosclerotic vascular disease. Diabetic patients were excluded from the study, because their dyslipidemia and vascular disease are mediated via a different mechanism. The patients were classified into four groups. Group I [high parathyroid hormone (PTH) in the absence of calcium channel blockers (CCBs), n = 56] represented the highest [Ca++i]. Group II (high PTH in the presence of CCBs, n = 43) and group III (lower PTH in the absence of CCBs, n = 37) represented intermediate [Ca++i]. Group IV (lower PTH in the presence of CCBs, n = 40) represented the lowest [Ca++i]. High PTH was defined as &gt; or = 3.0 times normal; lower PTH, as &lt; 3.0 times normal. Lower [Ca++i] was achieved through the use of CCBs, or through lower PTH, or both. Lower PTH was achieved by parathyroidectomy or calcitriol administration. The four groups showed no differences in age, sex, race, weight, dialysis duration, or primary disease. Group I showed a mean serum cholesterol of 358 +\/- 27 mg\/dL and serum triglycerides of 469 +\/- 41 mg\/dL. Group II showed mean serum cholesterol of 198 +\/- 21 mg\/dL and serum triglycerides of 147 +\/- 17 mg\/dL. Group III showed a mean serum cholesterol of 205 +\/- 20 mg\/dL and serum triglycerides of 174 +\/- 16 mg\/dL. Group IV showed mean serum cholesterol of 184 +\/- 10 mg\/dL (p = 0.008) and serum triglycerides of 103 +\/- 8 mg\/dL (p = 0.005). The cardiovascular morbidity and mortality incidences were: group I, 64%; group II, 27%; group III, 31%; and group IV, 20% (p = 0.002). We conclude that, in non diabetic PD patients, dyslipidemia is related to a hyperparathyroid-induced increase in cytosolic calcium [Ca++i]. Lowering [Ca++i] by decreasing the parathormone level (via parathyroidectomy or calcitriol administration), or by blocking calcium entry into cells (via CCBs), or both, is associated with less dyslipidemia and improved long-term morbidity and mortality related to atherosclerotic vascular disease.","540":"Preservation of residual renal function (RRF) is an important goal. In children, a more rapid decline in RRF has been observed under hemodialysis (HD) therapy as compared with peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy. In adults, however, automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) may cause a more rapid decline of RRF than continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) does. The objective of the present study, a survey in a single center over the last 15 years, was to assess the impact of APD versus hemodiafiltration (HDF) on daily urinary volume (dUV) outcome. We included 97 children who were dialyzed for at least a 12-month period between January 1985 and December 1999, using either HDF (n = 60; 62%) or PD [n = 37; 38% (86% of those on APD)]. The endpoint was anuria occurrence, defined as a dUV below 50 mL\/m2 body surface area (BSA) at three consecutive monthly determinations. Despite the use of HDF as hemodialysis therapy (that is, biocompatible membranes and a very low incidence of vascular instability during ultrafiltration), PD--even predominantly prescribed as APD--was associated with better preservation of residual dUV. At dialysis end, anuria occurred in 65% of the children undergoing HD as compared with 23% of those undergoing PD. The mean age of the children at dialysis start was lower in the PD group. No other significant differences were noted between the groups, either for the rate of uropathies or for the RRF at initiation of dialysis.","541":"Automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) is considered the first-choice chronic peritoneal dialysis modality for pediatric patients. Nighttime APD courses reduce the impact of PD treatment on a patient's and family's way of life, and the wide range of prescription options permit the dialysis schedule to be tailored to the needs of children of varying age and body size. We registered data concerning the dialytic regimens adopted in 12 pediatric dialysis centers for the treatment of 110 children on APD. Of the 110 children, 64 (aged 7.6 +\/- 5.1 years) were on nightly intermittent peritoneal dialysis (NIPD); 29 (aged 9.2 +\/- 4.3 years) were on tidal peritoneal dialysis (TPD); and 17 (aged 8.2 +\/- 4.9 years) were on continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). The main prescription parameters for the various regimens (mean +\/- standard deviation) were these: NIPD--exchanges: 13.0 +\/- 5.8; duration: 10.0 +\/- 1.1 hours; dwell volume: 36.5 +\/- 6.2 mL\/kg body weight (BW); glucose concentration: 1.69% +\/- 0.41%. TPD--exchanges: 23.3 +\/- 8.1; duration: 10.0 +\/- 1.0 hours; dwell volume: 36.1 +\/- 5.9 mL\/kg BW; glucose concentration: 1.63% +\/- 0.37%. CCPD--exchanges: 13.0 +\/- 4.7; duration: 10.1 +\/- 1.3 hours; dwell volume: 37.7 +\/- 5.2 mL\/kg BW; glucose concentration: 1.65% +\/- 0.28%. Tidal volume was 52.2% +\/- 9.0% of initial fill volume. Daytime dwell volume was 54.8% +\/- 17.3% of night volume in CCPD patients, and 56.6% +\/- 13.3% in 9 patients on continuous TPD. Because the patient population in this report varied in age, body size, and metabolic needs, the resulting range in prescription parameters was quite wide. Nevertheless, the duration of nightly PD sessions averaged 10 hours, fill volume averaged 36 mL per kilogram body weight, and daytime volume averaged 50% of nighttime fill volume.","542":"Determining Kt\/V in peritoneal dialysis (PD) requires estimation of total body water (TBW). The Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) guidelines recommend use of the Mellits and Cheek (MC) formulas for the estimation of TBW in children. However, the MC formulas were developed from healthy children and may not apply to children on PD. Re-evaluating the MC data with additional, recent data from healthy infants has led to the development of new formulas. In addition, and as part of a prospective study of children initiating PD, the Pediatric Peritoneal Dialysis Study Consortium (PPDSC) has directly measured TBW using H2[18O]. To assess the impact of various TBW estimates, KPDt\/V values prospectively collected in 24 children were calculated using H2[18O]-measured TBW (O18), MC-derived TBW (MCD), and new-formula TBW (NEW). The mean weekly KPDt\/V by O18 was 2.2; by MCD, it was 2.0; and by NEW, it was 2.0. The results derived using the O18 method varied from both the MCD and the NEW results (p &lt; 0.001). The mean deviation from the measured KPDt\/V using O18 was 9.5% (maximum: 16%) using the MCD estimate and 7.8% (maximum: 18%) using the NEW formulas. Determinations of KPDt\/V are significantly affected by the method of estimating TBW. The PPDSC formulas for children on PD based on the use of H2[18O] offer the most accurate means of calculating TBW and should replace formulas derived from healthy children. The use of Kt\/V itself as a marker of adequacy in children will be validated only in prospective studies.","543":"Delayed use of the peritoneal catheter may be one method of reducing catheter-related complications in chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD); however, the risks and benefits of immediate as compared with delayed use have not been examined in children. We retrospectively analyzed 33 peritoneal catheter placements in 27 children between 1997 and 2000. Eleven catheters were used for PD immediately following insertion (group I); 22 catheters were used only after a delay averaging 20 days (group D). Characteristics of the children in the two groups were similar. Catheter-related complications within the first 3 months after placement--including dialysate leak, fibrin plug, outflow obstruction, cuff extrusion, herniation, exit-site and tunnel infection, peritonitis, and catheter revision and replacement--were evaluated. Rates of individual complications in the two groups were similar, but several trends were noted. Dialysate leaks were more common in group I (rate of 0.36 in group I vs 0.09 in group D), and infectious complications were more common in group D (rate of exit-site or tunnel infection of 0.14 in group D vs 0.09 in group I; rate of peritonitis of 0.36 in group D vs 0.18 in group I). We conclude from this small study that delayed use of the peritoneal catheter does not appear to convey significant advantages over immediate use; however, immediate use may be associated with more frequent dialysate leaks. On the other hand, delayed use may be associated with a greater risk of infection. Further studies involving larger numbers of children will be necessary to confirm these findings.","544":"Milky spots are submesothelial lymphoid structures, essential for the maturation of resident peritoneal macrophages, for peritoneal defense, and for all peritoneal inflammatory and immune processes. We evaluated the number and size of milky spots in omentum of rats subjected to dialysis for 15, 30, and 60 days and in omentum of non dialyzed control rats (5 rats per group). After 15 days of dialysis, the number (4.2 +\/- 1.5\/cm2) and mean size (0.13 +\/- 0.04 mm2) of milky spots were significantly lower than in the control group (7.6 +\/- 2.3\/cm2, p &lt; 0.03; 0.25 +\/- 0.04 mm2, p &lt; 0.01). After 30 days of dialysis, values returned to a level similar to that in controls (6.8 +\/- 1.9\/cm2 and 0.20 +\/- 0.04 mm2). After 60 days of dialysis, values were significantly greater than in all other groups (11.8 +\/- 2.2\/cm2 and 0.41 +\/- 0.07 mm2, p &lt; 0.03). The early decrease in milky spots seems to be due to washing of the peritoneum and replacement of resident white cells at the expense of the white cell population in the milky spots. At 30 days, a process of adaptation seems to establish functional equilibrium. The increase in milky spots after 60 days of dialysis may be due to the chronic inflammatory stimulus of dialysis solutions with poor biocompatibility.","545":"Peritoneal dialysis is often the renal replacement therapy of choice in pediatric patients, but the smaller catheters are at high risk for occlusion by fibrin clots. Tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA) is a recombinant protease specific for fibrin, and has been shown to be an effective thrombolytic for central venous catheters. The present study aimed to demonstrate the effectiveness of t-PA for thrombolysis in occluded peritoneal catheters. Six patients between 3 weeks and 15 years of age presented with 7 episodes of occluded peritoneal catheters. In all cases, t-PA (2 mg in 40 mL normal saline) was instilled into the catheter. Patency was assessed after 60 minutes by rapid instillation and drainage of 10 mL dialysis solution per kilogram patient body weight. Thrombolysis was effective in 4 of 7 attempts. In 2 cases, occlusion occurred in the setting of acute peritonitis. In 2 cases, catheters required surgical replacement. One child developed a leak at the catheter exit site within 24 hours after treatment. No intraperitoneal bleeding was observed, and no changes were observed in systemic coagulation indices [prothrombin time (PT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), fibrinogen degradation products (FDP), and fibrinogen] assessed pre- and post-thrombolysis. In cases of occluded PD catheters, t-PA appears to be an effective and safe treatment.","546":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients lose significant quantities of protein and albumin during the dialysis procedure. The losses are greater in high transporters. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relationship between peritoneal membrane transport characteristics and protein losses. We studied 33 PD patients [14 men, 19 women; mean age: 53.5 years (range: 21-80 years)]. Fourteen patients had diabetes, and 22 were on automated PD. Dialysis adequacy was good, with a mean Kt\/V of 2.63 (range: 1.51-4.89). Patients underwent a standard peritoneal equilibration test (PET). In addition, dialysate albumin (Alb) and protein (Pro) were measured at 0, 1, 2, and 4 hours, after lack of interference from unspent dialysate was ensured. Of the 33 patients, 23 were high or high-average transporters [based on 4-hour dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creatinine (D\/PCr &gt; or = 0.65)]. Protein losses owing to PD ranged from 3.5 g\/day to 13.2 g\/day (median: 5.9 g\/day), of which 1.9-7.14 g\/day (median: 3.21 g\/day) was albumin. The 4-hour D\/PCr correlated with the 4-hour D\/PAlb (r = 0.62, p &lt; 0.01), and 4-hour D\/PPro (r = 0.63, p &lt; 0.01). This finding persisted after correction for volume, indicating that it was not simply a concentration effect. The 4-hour D\/PAlb and 4-hour D\/PPro also correlated with the 24-hour PD albumin and protein losses. These results suggest a strong association between D\/PCr and D\/P for proteins. This observation is consistent with the increased protein losses through PD in high transporters and may be related to the inferior outcomes in this group.","547":"Our study was carried out to investigate changes in nutrition and individual peritoneal membrane transport characteristics in elderly patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), expressed as the personal dialysis capacity (PDC). We performed 376 PDC tests in 229 non diabetic patients who were undergoing CAPD from May 1995 to May 1999 in a multicenter study in Japan. We divided the patients into three groups: elderly (age &gt; or = 65 years, n = 56), middle-aged (age 50-65 years, n = 150), and young (age &lt; 50, n = 170). No significant differences were seen in duration of CAPD and incidence of peritonitis between the groups. We then compared the peritoneal function calculated by PDC test in the groups. Serum levels of albumin in elderly patients were significantly lower than those in middle-aged and young patients (elderly: 3.2 +\/- 0.1; middle-aged: 3.4 +\/- 0.1, p = 0.0447 vs elderly; young: 3.4 +\/- 0.1, p = 0.0272 vs elderly). Plasma protein loss from the peritoneum in elderly patients was significantly higher than in middle-aged and young patients (elderly: 0.11 +\/- 0.01; middle-aged: 0.09 +\/- 0.01, p = 0.0136 vs elderly; young: 0.09 +\/- 0.01, p = 0.0161 vs elderly). No significant differences in ultrafiltration volume and water permeability were seen between the groups. Peritoneal area in the elderly group was significantly higher than in the middle-aged and young groups. Peritoneal creatinine clearance (CCr) and Kt\/V in elderly patients were significantly higher than in middle-aged and young patients. However, no significant difference in protein nitrogen appearance (PNA) or protein catabolic rate (PCR) was seen between the groups. Urea and creatinine generation rates in elderly patients were significantly lower than in the middle-aged and young patients. These data show that elderly patients receiving CAPD are well maintained from the perspective of urea and water metabolism, indicating that CAPD therapy for the elderly is more acceptable than expected. However, caution should be exercised, owing to the lower serum albumin seen in elderly patients.","548":"Acidosis has been implicated in increased protein catabolism and malnutrition of dialysis. The present study examines the effect of acid-base balance on the nutrition status of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. We followed 43 PD patients for one year. Blood chemistries were measured monthly. Patients were divided on the basis of subjective global assessment (SGA) into well-nourished (A), mildly-to-moderately malnourished (B), and severely malnourished (C) groups. Mean serum bicarbonate and albumin concentrations were, for group A (n = 16), 23.5 mmol\/L and 3.96 g\/dL respectively; for group B (n = 17), 27.2 mmol\/L and 3.50 g\/dL respectively; and for group C (n = 10), 25.9 mmol\/L and 2.9 g\/dL respectively. In group A, mean serum bicarbonate was significantly lower, and albumin concentration significantly higher as compared with the other groups. Interestingly, of 9 patients with serum HCO3 &lt; 22 mmol\/L, 6 were in group A and 2 were in group B. Of 6 patients with serum HCO3 &gt; 29 mmol\/L, 5 were in group B and 4 were in group C. The data suggest that well-nourished PD patients tend to be more acidotic. Malnutrition in alkalotic PD patients may be due to low protein intake resulting in decreased acid production; however, an effect of alkalosis on protein metabolism cannot be excluded.","549":"With the aim of evaluating nutrition indices and dialysis adequacy level in patients who started peritoneal dialysis (PD) without residual renal function, we retrospectively studied 19 patients [8 men, 11 women; 3 with diabetes (15.8%); mean age: 44.5 +\/- 10.74 years; 15 on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), 3 on continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), 1 on nightly intermittent peritoneal dialysis (NIPD)]. The mean time spent by these patients on hemodialysis before PD was 62.7 +\/- 54.7 months (range: 8.8-216 months), and the mean time on PD was 46.2 +\/- 21.4 months (range: 10-75 months). In these patients, we measured weekly Kt\/V urea, weekly creatinine clearance (CrC), normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR), body surface area (BSA), urea distribution volume (V), serum albumin, body mass index (BMI), percent lean body mass (%LBM), infusion volume (liters per day), subjective global assessment (SGA), and peritoneal equilibration test (PET). Using the Student t-test at a significance level of p &lt; 0.05, we compared initial body weight (INW), actual weight (AW), and ideal body weight (IBW) according to age, sex, and height. We analyzed actuarial and technique survival (Kaplan-Meier). In regard to patient survival, only death was considered the end point; for technique survival, only technique failure was considered the end point. Data are expressed as mean +\/- standard deviation. Results were: Kt\/V, 2.20 +\/- 0.46 L weekly; CrC, 59.11 +\/- 12 L weekly; nPCR, 1.08 +\/- 0.25 g\/kg daily; BSA, 1.67 +\/- 0.2 m2; V, 33.34 +\/- 7.12; serum albumin, 3.68 +\/- 0.22 g\/dL; BMI, 24.06 +\/- 4.16; %LBM, 64.92 +\/- 10.13; SGA, 94.7% well-nourished; AW, 65.37 +\/- 13.88 kg; IBW, 67.21 +\/- 10.5 kg (AW vs IBW: r = 0.69, p &gt; 0.05); INW, 61.54 +\/- 11.07 kg (INW vs AW: r = 0.92, p &lt; 0.05; INW vs IBW: r = 0.71, p &lt; 0.05). Distribution of transport status by PET was 15.8% high transport, 36.8% high-average transport, 36.8% low-average transport, and 10.5% low transport. Mean infusion volume was 10.41 +\/- 1.36 L in 24 hours. Cumulative survival was 100%, 98%, and 82% after 1, 2, and 6 years respectively. Technique survival was 100% after 6 years. The adequacy results accord with Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) recommendations, and the nutrition indices and actuarial and technique survival are satisfactory for anuric patients.","550":"Our aim was to show, in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, the relationships between zinc (serum level and dietary intake) and adequacy and duration of CAPD, age, and measures of nutrition. Serum zinc (12.2 +\/- 1.8 mumol\/L) was not significantly related to dietary zinc intake (9.9 +\/- 2.5 mg daily), but depended on daily instilled (r = -0.331, p &lt; 0.05) and effluent (r = -0.311, p &lt; 0.05) dialysate volumes and on patient age (r = -0.304, p &lt; 0.05). Positive correlations were seen between serum zinc level and laboratory (but not anthropometric) markers of nutrition: prealbumin (r = 0.349, p &lt; 0.05), iron (r = 0.447, p &lt; 0.05), transferrin saturation [(TSAT) r = 0.374, p &lt; 0.05]. Additionally, zinc intake was positively related to serum ferritin level (r = 0.370, p &lt; 0.05). Serum zinc level positively influenced blood morphology [correlation with hemoglobin (r = 0.287, p &lt; 0.05) and mean corpuscular hemoglobin concentration (r = 0.361, p &lt; 0.05)]. Zinc intake showed negative correlations with serum levels of total cholesterol (r = -0.373, p &lt; 0.05) and vitamin E (r = -0.504, p &lt; 0.05), and a positive correlation with HDL: total cholesterol ratio (r = 0.338, p &lt; 0.05). Mean values of three latter parameters were out of the normal limits (total cholesterol: 219.2 +\/- 47.0 mg\/dL; vitamin E: 1.91 +\/- 0.82 mg\/dL; HDL: total cholesterol ratio: 16.7 +\/- 5.1). We conclude that, in CAPD patients, zinc is a marker of nutrition showing beneficial effect on serum iron parameters, blood morphology, lipid profile, and elevated vitamin E concentration. Zinc supplementation is needed for approximately 16% of CAPD patients, especially older patients and those requiring higher dialysate volumes.","551":"Protein calorie malnutrition (PCM) is a major predictor of morbidity and mortality in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Oxidative stress has been implicated as a contributory cause. The relative lack of ascorbic acid, a plasma antioxidant, has been reported in CAPD patients. We therefore examined the correlation between serum ascorbic acid (SAA) and parameters of PCM in a cross-sectional study of 50 clinically stable adult CAPD patients. The mean age of the study group was 61 +\/- 11 years; 48% of the patients were male; and 64% had diabetes. The parameters assessed were SAA, serum albumin (S Alb), body mass index (BMI), subjective global assessment (SGA), and lean body mass (LBM). The results (mean +\/- standard deviation) were: SAA, 9.44 +\/- 8.79 mg\/L; S Alb, 31.6 +\/- 4.9 g\/L; BMI, 24.4 +\/- 3.4; LBM, 0.66 +\/- 0.14 kg\/kg body weight; SGA, 9 of 50 were considered mildly-to-moderately malnourished (the rest were well-nourished). A significant correlation (p &lt; 0.001) was found between SAA and S Alb only with SAA &lt; or = 9 mg\/L. No correlation was seen between SAA (at any level) and BMI or LBM. The SAA was not significantly different between the groups as graded by SGA. The data suggest that the mechanisms for low serum albumin in these patients may be related to the role of ascorbic acid as a plasma antioxidant.","552":"Oral intake of ascorbic acid is essential for optimum health in human beings. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients have an increased need for ascorbic acid, because of increased loss through dialysate, reduced intake owing to nausea and loss of appetite, and increased oxidative stress. However, optimum intake is still controversial. We studied 50 clinically stable patients to determine the relationship between oral ascorbic acid intake and serum ascorbic acid (SAA) level. Total oral intake ranged from 28 mg daily to 412 mg daily. Only one patient had an oral intake of ascorbic acid below 60 mg per day. The SAA levels ranged from 1 mg\/L to 36.17 mg\/L. Although a strong correlation existed between intake and SAA (p &lt; 0.001, R2 = 0.47), the variation in SAA at any given intake level was wide. Of the studied patients, 62% had an SAA &lt; 8.7 mg\/L, 40% had an SAA &lt; 5.1 mg\/L (below the level in a healthy population), and 12% had a level below 2 mg\/L (scorbutic). None of the patients demonstrated clinical manifestations of scurvy. Our results show that, in CAPD patients, ascorbic acid deficiency can be reliably detected only with SAA measurements, and oral intake may influence SAA level. To maintain ascorbic acid in the normal range for healthy adults, daily oral intake needs to be increased above the U.S. recommended dietary allowance to 80-140 mg.","553":"Hypoalbuminemia is the strongest predictor of death in patients with renal failure. We planned to investigate the factors influencing serum albumin levels in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. We prospectively followed 100 CAPD patients for 18.6 +\/- 12.8 months. The parameters searched for a correlation with serum albumin levels were: peritoneal transport kinetics; presence of nephrotic syndrome; biochemical parameters; anthropometric measurements; and subjective global assessment (SGA). Older patients (age &gt; or = 60 years), patients with diabetes mellitus or amyloidosis, high and high-average transporters, and those with nephrotic syndrome had significantly lower albumin levels throughout the follow-up. In addition, significantly lower albumin levels were found in patients who were in the SGA \"malnourished\" categories and those who had iPTH levels &lt; or = 65 pg\/mL. Albumin level was negatively correlated with age, C-reactive protein (CRP), and fibrinogen level; it was positively correlated with total cholesterol, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level, and triceps skin-fold thickness. By regression analysis, age [risk ratio (RR): 0.2437], presence of diabetes mellitus (RR: 0.1421) and high or high-average transport status (RR: 0.1156) were independent predictors of hypoalbuminemia (&lt; or = 3.5 g\/dL). In conclusion, development of hypoalbuminemia is multifactorial in CAPD patients. Older age, cause of renal failure, transport status, chronic inflammation, presence of nephrotic syndrome, and nutrition status are important determinants of hypoalbuminemia.","554":"We reviewed all peritonitis over the last decade to compare patient outcomes on automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). There were 327 episodes of peritonitis in 198 patients during this period. The rates were 0.57 per patient-year and 0.55 per patient-year on APD and CAPD respectively. For 52% of the episodes, the patients were admitted and managed with a mixture of CAPD and APD, so that no further analysis of outcomes was performed. For 48% (158) of the episodes, the patients were treated as outpatients and remained on their existing modality: 49 on APD and 100 on CAPD (9 catheter-related peritonitis excluded). In the APD group, 5 catheters were eventually removed for recurrent or refractory peritonitis. One other patient died in conjunction with peritonitis. Therefore, the adverse outcome was 12% on APD (6\/49 episodes). In the CAPD group, 5 catheters were removed for refractory or relapsing peritonitis (including 1 for peritonitis with a leak). One other patient with fungal peritonitis died. Therefore, the adverse outcome on CAPD was 6% (6\/100 episodes), which is not statistically different from the 12% on APD (p = 0.21). In summary, the incidence of peritonitis was similar on APD and CAPD, with one half the patients in each group requiring admission. In peritonitis treated on an outpatient basis, failure was twice as high with continuation of APD as compared with continuation of CAPD, but the difference was nonsignificant. Further studies on managing peritonitis in patients on APD are needed.","555":"Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) is recognized as a serious complication of peritoneal dialysis. However, recovery is possible if an appropriate diagnosis and treatment are made. The term SEP is used most often, but is inaccurate, particularly the reference to peritonitis. A more accurate description would be \"encapsulating peritoneal sclerosis\" (EPS). From the therapeutic perspective, the diagnosis should be established before EPS develops. Early diagnosis is important. Furthermore, it is also important to determine the therapeutic tactics for EPS according to the disease stage. Most cases of EPS develop with manifestations of fever, increased levels of C-reactive protein (CRP), and slight ileus symptoms, accompanied by increased ascites (\"inflammatory stage\"). Following precise identification of the inflammatory stage, steroid administration should be initiated immediately with the onset of EPS. Methylprednisolone pulse therapy is recommended during the early stage. If the EPS is not relieved, or if it recurs within 1 month, the steroid dose should be decreased and the patient should be managed by total parenteral nutrition (TPN) (\"encapsulating stage\"). If ileus symptoms remain despite the absence of inflammatory findings and decreased ascites, laparotomy and enterolysis should be considered within 6 months (\"ileus stage\"). However, it is important that the enterolysis be performed without damaging the capsule-covered intestine. To date, we have successfully treated EPS in 18 of 19 patients using these options. In 3 patients, EPS was relieved by steroid administration. In 15 patients, EPS was relieved by total intestinal enterolysis. Enterolysis patients had satisfactory operative outcomes and eventually returned to their previous social activities. One patient experienced perforation of the small intestine and pan-peritonitis, and died of sepsis. In summary, EPS is not an incurable disease. It can be completely overcome by active diagnosis and treatment.","556":"The present study was carried out to investigate changes in the expression of aquaporins (AQPs) in the peritoneum. The effects of the renin-angiotensin system on the expression of AQPs with and without angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) or angiotensin II type 1a receptor blocker (ARB) were then examined. We divided 20 male Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats into four groups, dialyzed with these solutions: saline; 10% glucose (TZ); 10% glucose plus benazepril (ACEI: 4 mg\/kg daily); and 10% glucose plus valsartan (ARB: 10 mg\/kg daily). The ACEI and ARB were administered into the peritoneum for 7 days. Expression of AQP-1-AQP-4 mRNA was studied by semiquantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Ultrafiltration volume (UFV) and peritoneal function were measured by peritoneal equilibration test (PET). In the TZ group, expression of AQP-1 and AQP-4 was enhanced in parallel with an increment in UFV. Expression of AQP-1 and AQP-4 was also observed in the mesothelium by immunofluorescence microscopy. On the other hand, in ACEI- and ARB-treated rats, expression of AQP-1 and AQP-4 was significantly suppressed, accompanied by loss of UFV. Our results suggest that the renin-angiotensin system plays an important role in the regulation of water transport in the peritoneum. Administration of ACEI or ARB in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis should be carried out with caution.","557":"This study aimed to clarify the role of laminin (a component of the extracellular matrix) in the mechanism of peritoneal fibrosis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, and the effect of prednisolone on such fibrosis. We used semiquantitative reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and ELISA to study laminin mRNA expression and laminin protein production by human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) cultured under various conditions. After 6 hours, medium 199 with a high glucose content (4.0%) increased laminin mRNA expression by 1.38-fold relative to control medium (0.1% glucose). Prednisolone (1 mumol\/L) suppressed this increase by 92.9%. The laminin protein level in culture supernatant was increased 1.83-fold after incubation for 24 hours in high-glucose medium. Prednisolone (1 mumol\/L) suppressed this increase by 58.3%. The effects of prednisolone were prevented by a glucocorticoid receptor antagonist (RU486) at 100 mumol\/L. We conclude that culture of HPMCs in high-glucose medium increases laminin mRNA and protein expression, while prednisolone suppresses these changes via the glucocorticoid receptor, suggesting that prednisolone may prevent peritoneal fibrosis in CAPD patients.","558":"The present study evaluates the long-term effects of single peritonitis episodes on peritoneal equilibration test (PET) results in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Twenty-five patients (10 men, 15 women) with a mean age of 37.4 +\/- 18.7 years were enrolled in this study because all had uneventful peritoneal dialysis periods for more than one year after a first peritonitis episode. Data from a total of 69 PETs were available [25 from before the first peritonitis episode (initial PET), 23 within 1 year after the episode (1-year PET), and 21 within 1-2 years after the episode (2-year PET)]. The changes in the PET results were evaluated using the dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creatinine (D\/PCr) and the dialysate-to-instilled glucose ratio (D4\/D0) after a 4-hour dwell. The mean values of D\/PCr and D4\/D0 showed no statistically significant changes between the initial PETs, 1-year PETs, and 2-year PETs. However, analysis of the results for patients with culture-positive peritonitis (n = 17) revealed significant changes in the mean values of D\/PCr and D4\/D0 between the initial PET and the 2-year PET (0.63 +\/- 0.06 vs 0.70 +\/- 0.09, p = 0.01; and 0.41 +\/- 0.05 vs 0.37 +\/- 0.06, p = 0.04, respectively). The long-term effect of a definite bacterial peritonitis episode seems to be an increase in small-molecule transport. In patients with culture-negative peritonitis, the episode had less impact on peritoneal transport.","559":"Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) is a serious complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Previous reports place the prevalence of SEP at 0.54%-7.3%. We estimated the prevalence of SEP in our unit to be 1.4% over the period 1989-1999. We here present the 6 identified cases. All of the patients presented with small-bowel obstruction; hemorrhagic ascites was identified in 3 cases. All 6 patients experienced ultrafiltration inadequacy, and 5 were treated with glucose polymer (icodextrin; duration of treatment: 1 month-2.5 years). Peritoneal dialysis was stopped at the time of diagnosis in 2 cases. In the other 4 cases, PD had been withdrawn some time prior to the SEP being diagnosed (2 weeks-5 years). Five of the patients have died; the 6th currently uses hemodialysis.","560":"Among several regimes used in the oral treatment of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)--related peritonitis, ciprofloxacin and ofloxacin showed the higher treatment efficacy, with an overall cure rate of 80% over a treatment duration of 10-16 days. The antimicrobial activity of these agents against gram-positive episodes was equal to or even higher than that against other peritonitis episodes, and the effectiveness of oral ciprofloxacin can be further increased either by an additional intraperitoneal dose for the first 1-5 days, or by a simultaneous intraperitoneal dose of vancomycin in the first 24 hours. Clinical resistance to the new quinolones has been uncommon. The possibly increasing resistance to ciprofloxacin is a consequence of suboptimal dosing, with the resulting low local concentrations of the antibiotic. Oral treatment with quinolones provides a good therapeutic alternative to more widely used antibiotics for initial treatment of peritonitis episodes. However, more extensive data from comparative randomized studies with agents administered orally and intraperitoneally would be able to clearly elucidate the overall safety and success of oral treatment of PD-related peritonitis with quinolones or any new agent.","561":"We report four episodes of non Candida albicans peritonitis (NCAP) in 3 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Risk factors for NCAP included diabetes mellitus and prior antibiotic use in half of the cases. The antibiotic treatment was prescribed for exit-site infection (ESI) or peritonitis in the patient. Treatment for NCAP included antifungal therapy with oral fluconazole or intravenous amphotericin B. The NCAP resulted in catheter loss in 100% of the patients over time. Initial catheter salvage in one patient was followed 6 months later by catheter loss following treatment of a bacterial peritonitis that was complicated by the development of Candida (Torulopsis) glabrata peritonitis unresponsive to treatment with intravenous amphotericin B. Although the literature suggests that Candida peritonitis responds to oral fluconazole with and without catheter removal, this series suggests that the treatment of NCAP includes removal of the peritoneal dialysis catheter with appropriate antifungal agents.","562":"Exit-site infections (ESIs) are frequently due to gram-positive organisms and occasionally to gram-negative organisms. Initial empiric antibiotic therapy is therefore directed against these organisms until culture reports are available. Two cases of ESI associated with Mycobacterium are here reported. The first patient, a 63-year-old man with type 2 diabetes, recently treated for Staphylococcus epidermidis peritonitis, presented with acute purulent drainage at the catheter exit site, accompanied by pain and erythema. No tunnel abscess was identified by ultrasound. Empiric antibiotic therapy was initiated with ofloxacin and vancomycin. A rapid-growing acid-fast bacillus (AFB) noted four days after culture was eventually identified as Mycobacterium fortuitum. Ofloxacin was continued, vancomycin was discontinued, and clarithromycin was added. The ESI initially showed improvement; therapy was therefore continued for several months. However, cultures remained positive for M. fortuitum, and the catheter was removed 5 months after therapy was initiated. The second patient, a 28-year-old woman, presented with severe pain and tenderness at the exit site without erythema or drainage. Empiric therapy with cefazolin, gentamicin, and cephalexin was initiated. Gram-positive cocci and an AFB were identified from the exit-site culture, and antibiotics were initially changed to clarithromycin, trimethoprim\/sulfamethoxazole, and ofloxacin. The organisms were subsequently identified as M. chelonae-M. abscessus complex and coagulase-negative Staphylococcus. The patient continued to improve after 3 weeks of antibiotic therapy. However, despite the initial improvement in the ESI, the M. chelonae-M. abscessus complex continued to grow, and amikacin was added intravenously. Despite continued treatment, the ESI did not resolve, and the catheter was removed after 4 months of therapy. Despite unusual exist-site infections with rapidly growing AFBs, both patients continued continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) while undergoing treatment for ESI. Catheters were left intact, as improvement was initially seen with no evidence of tunnel infection or peritonitis. Rapid-growing AFB should be considered another possible causative agent for ESI. Two cases of atypical mycobacterial exit-site infection are presented to illustrate the difficulties in managing this complication of peritoneal dialysis. Ofloxacin--or other quinolones--may provide a better spectrum of coverage when choosing empiric therapy in patients presenting with ESI.","563":"Microbial colonization and infection of dialysis catheters is the major cause of catheter failure. The present study aimed to develop a method to permit the study of microbial biofilm formation and antibiotic prophylaxis and therapy. Standard silicon rubber and silver-impregnated catheters were sectioned into 1 mm slices and placed into 1-cm x 2-cm culture slide chambers. Fresh clinical isolates were obtained from infected patients and suspended in concentrations of 10(3), 10(6), and 10(9) colony forming units (CFU) per milliliter in a variety of liquid suspending culture media, which included serum protein constituents. Antibiotics could be added to the suspending fluid to determine prophylactic activity, or at any time thereafter to determine therapeutic activity. The catheter sections were incubated with the microbial challenge for 6 hours, 12 hours, 24 hours, and 48 hours and then washed in flowing distilled water to remove unattached biofilm. They were then stained with acridine orange, which fluoresces microbial DNA, and were examined by confocal scanning laser microscopy. Biofilm formation, representing colonization and infection, were quantified by comparing the fluorescent pixel analysis of the uninoculated control with the challenged catheter. The method was reproducible and permitted quantitative analysis. Standard silicon rubber catheters demonstrated greater biofilm formation than silver-impregnated catheters. The method examines the factors involved in microbial colonization and infection, and in antibiotic prophylaxis and therapy.","564":"In continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, peritonitis is a dangerous complication. Chemical examinations in the dialysate can be successfully used to assess permeability disturbances, hemostatic balance, and (for early detection and follow-up) cellular inflammatory reaction. In 7 CAPD patients (age: 50 +\/- 15 years; dialysis duration: 40 +\/- 24 months) with peritonitis episodes, and in 17 age-matched CAPD patients (age: 50 +\/- 13 years; dialysis duration: 29 +\/- 18 months) without peritonitis, we examined daily dialysate cell count (CC) and concentrations of albumin (ALB), immunoglobulin G (IgG), thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), D-dimer (DD), and interleukin-6 (IL-6) after the long dwell (8-10 hours) over an interval of at least 14 days. In CAPD patients with peritonitis episodes, all parameters (CC, ALB, IgG, TAT, DD, IL-6) were significantly increased in the first days [IL-6 mean: 25,190 pg\/mL (range: 2560-52,708 pg\/mL) vs 66 pg\/mL (range: 21-163 pg\/mL)]; then, up to day 14 after successful therapy with antibiotics, the levels showed no differences as compared with CAPD patients without peritonitis. In the case of relapse of peritonitis (4 cases), concentration of IL-6 rose again on day 14, 1 day earlier than did the other parameters. Determination of IL-6 in the dialysate is a reliable prognostic parameter for the course of peritonitis (start, end, relapse) in CAPD patients.","565":"The aim of the present study was to examine the association between 4-hour dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creatinine (D\/PCr), erythropoietin (EPO) responsiveness [EPO (U\/week)\/hemoglobin (g\/L)], and C-reactive protein (CRP). Subjects were 54 prevalent peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients [mean age: 58 years; 30 women, 24 men; 28 with diabetes; 15 on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD); 39 on continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD); mean Kt\/V: 2.44]. In 17 patients, CRP was elevated (&gt; 15 mg\/L), and in 39 patients, 4-hour D\/PCr was high or high-average (&gt; or = 0.65). Mean hemoglobin (Hb) was 115.5 +\/- 12.9 g\/L; median EPO dose was 2800 U\/week, and median EPO\/Hb was 24.5. A nonsignificant negative correlation was noted between CRP and hemoglobin (r = -0.25, p = 0.07), but no correlations were seen between CRP and 4-hour D\/PCr, or hemoglobin and 4-hour D\/PCr. No correlation was seen between EPO\/Hb and 4-hour D\/PCr or CRP. Multiple linear regression (stepwise, alpha = 0.05) was performed with outcome hemoglobin and independent variables EPO [U\/week (forced in)], percent transferrin saturation [TSAT (forced in)], age, sex, diabetes mellitus, serum albumin, CRP, time on PD, 4-hour D\/PCr, normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR), ferritin, intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), aluminum, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (ACEI) use. Serum albumin (1.27, p &lt; 0.01) and diabetes mellitus (-6.69, p = 0.04) were the only significant predictors of hemoglobin. With serum albumin removed from the model, age (but not CRP) became significant. These results do not support an association between peritoneal transport and EPO responsiveness, mediated by inflammation. The association between serum albumin and hemoglobin appears to be confounded by age more than by inflammation.","566":"The present study investigated the role of heme oxygenase-1 (HO-1) in regulating the vascular tone of the peritoneum undergoing peritoneal dialysis. First, we used reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to measure changes in the expression of HO-1 mRNA in the peritoneum of dehydrated Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats. Second, we used a charge-coupled-device (CCD) camera to measure changes in the diameter and blood flow in the small artery of the peritoneum after intravenous administration of saline, hemin (4-12 mumol\/kg), and tin-protoporphyrin (4-12 mumol\/kg) in dehydrated WKY rats. In non dehydrated rats (control), no expression of HO-1 mRNA in the peritoneum was seen. In dehydrated and 10% glucose-treated dehydrated rats, HO-1 expression was significantly enhanced as compared with the control rats. Intravenous administration of saline induced no significant changes in the diameter of the small artery in dehydrated WKY rats. Intravenous administration of hemin induced a significant increase in the diameter of the small artery in dehydrated WKY rats. Intravenous administration of tin-protoporphyrin induced a significant reduction in the diameter of the small artery in dehydrated WKY rats. Our results suggest that 10% glucose injection into the peritoneal cavity induces overexpression of HO-1 in the peritoneum of dehydrated rats. In addition, HO-1 regulates peritoneal function by the regulation of vascular tone in the peritoneum.","567":"Protein malnutrition is now well established as an important contributory factor to the high mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Low dietary protein calorie intake is one of the factors leading to protein malnutrition. If PD patients develop difficulty eating, percutaneous endoscopic gastrostomy (PEG) feeding may prove beneficial in providing adequate nutrition. Studies on the effectiveness of PEG feeding in PD patients are limited to pediatric patients. The objective of the present study was to assess the outcome of PEG feeding in adult patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on PD. We retrospectively reviewed charts from May 1992 to February 2000 of 10 consecutive patients in our center who had had feeding tubes inserted. The patients' ages ranged from 37 to 81 years, with mean age of 65. Of the 10 patients, 7 were male, 5 were diabetic, and 1 was infected with the human immunodeficiency virus. Two patients had cerebrovascular accident (CVA) with dysphagia, 3 had multi-infarct dementia, 2 had anoxic encephalopathy, 2 had dementia, and 1 had calciphylaxis with anorexia. Of the 10 patients, 9 failed to eat because of neurologic disorders. Two patients who had functioning PEG feedings before starting PD had no complications. Only 2 of 8 patients already on PD continued with long-term PD after a PEG was inserted. Both patients whose PD was not interrupted at the time of PEG placement immediately developed peritonitis. Of the 6 patients who were maintained on hemodialysis (HD), 2 developed peritonitis within one week of starting PEG feedings. The other 4 had no complications from PEG feedings while being maintained on HD, but 1 developed peritonitis when PD was resumed. Of the 5 patients who developed peritonitis, 3 experienced fungal peritonitis. In PD patients, PEG feeding is associated with frequent complications. However, PEG placement prior to PD initiation appears to be safe. Maintaining patients on HD for at least 6 weeks appears to decrease the incidence of peritonitis, but does not eliminate it. Use of anti-fungal prophylaxis and maintenance of the patient on HD for longer than 6 weeks may produce better results.","568":"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients frequently have multiple comorbidities, and cardiovascular disease remains the leading cause of death in these patients. The objectives of the present study were (1) to characterize the number and severity of cardiovascular comorbidities at the start of peritoneal dialysis (PD), and (2) to determine the impact of these comorbidities on mortality. We retrospectively studied all ESRD patients starting peritoneal dialysis at our center between 1990 and 1999. The baseline cardiovascular comorbid factors were categorized as ischemic heart disease, congestive heart failure, arrhythmia, peripheral vascular disease, and cerebrovascular disease. The severity of each factor was scored from 0 to 3. The number of comorbidities and the total cardiovascular comorbidity severity scores were determined for each patient. Cardiovascular deaths included those attributed to sudden death, cardiac disease, cerebrovascular disease, and complications of peripheral vascular disease. Of the 191 patients, 105 were men, and 105 (55%) had diabetes mellitus. The mean age was 60.8 +\/- 13.3 years and the mean time on PD was 18.8 +\/- 16.3 months. As the number of cardiovascular comorbidities increased, the proportion of patients who died of cardiovascular causes increased eighteen-fold. At each level of cardiovascular comorbidity, diabetic patients starting dialysis were younger, and their survival time was shorter as compared with non diabetic patients. Baseline comorbidity determination is important, as comorbidities are prognostic harbingers of eventual complications.","569":"Displacement of the peritoneal catheter tip is one of the most frequent causes of catheter malfunction. As a consequence, appropriate peritoneal effluent drainage is impossible. Alternatives to catheter exchange or invasive abdominal intervention did not appear until the alpha maneuver was described by Yoshihara et al. We review our experience with this maneuver over the last 7 years. We used the alpha maneuver in 24 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients (13 men and 11 women) with a mean age of 52 +\/- 16 years. Some patients required several repeat procedures (total procedures: 32). The mean time between placement of the catheter and performance of the alpha maneuver was 6.5 +\/- 7.9 months. In all patients, the technique was indicated for problems with peritoneal effluent drainage, after verification of catheter tip displacement by radiologic examination. In 6 patients, the initial maneuver was unsuccessful and had to be repeated. The first maneuver was effective in 11 of 24 cases (46%) and unsuccessful in the other 13 (54%). No differences in sex, renal disease, or age were seen between the two groups. The mean time between catheter placement and tip displacement detection was significantly lower in the cases of ineffective maneuver (2.7 +\/- 4.3 months) than in those that met with success (10.8 +\/- 9 months). In other words, 84% of unsuccessful maneuvers were performed in the first 3 months of catheter life. Of the 11 patients successfully treated, 6 continued on PD for 14.7 +\/- 6.3 months. Two other patients were transplanted with normal-functioning catheters, and two more left PD (after 10 and 17 months) for reasons unrelated to the catheter. One patient required a catheter change owing to breakdown in the Silastic after disruption by the metallic guide, which perforated the catheter wall. The 13 ineffective maneuvers involved 7 omentum entrapments, 1 procedure that was repeated effectively 15 days later, and 5 definite failures requiring catheter change. The failure rate may therefore be considered to be 20.8%, taking into consideration that omentum entrapment should not be an indication for the procedure. We conclude that the alpha maneuver for a displaced peritoneal catheter is a simple and effective procedure that can be applied at the patient's bedside. In consequence, it should be the technique of first choice in these situations. Only when the alpha maneuver fails should invasive methods, including catheter change, be considered.","570":"Laparotomic correction with or without omentectomy is occasionally required for malposition of a peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter. We reviewed the incidence of incisional hernia following laparotomic PD catheter correction with or with omentectomy. From January 1996 to December 1998, PD catheters were implanted by non open-dissection technique using a trocar in 148 patients. Laparotomy for PD catheter malposition was required in 20 of the 148 patients. Omentectomy was performed simultaneously in 11 patients. After laparotomy, the wound was closed with interrupted or continuous layered polyglycolidelactide polymer sutures. Dialysis was resumed after the third or fourth day. Incisional hernia developed in 30% (6\/20) of all patients undergoing laparotomy, but in none of the patients not undergoing laparotomy. The incidence increased when omentectomy was performed [5\/11 (45.5%) vs 1\/9 (11.1%)]. Multiparity, female sex, and laparotomy at a later time also predisposed to development of incisional hernia. Among the patients with incisional hernia, 2 patients showed multiple recurrences and 1 patient showed later leakage; PD catheters were lost in these patients. Another 3 patients continued continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) without a recurrence. The results suggest that incisional hernia is prevalent following laparotomic PD catheter correction, especially when omentectomy is performed simultaneously. Situations that seem to increase the risk of incisional hernia--inevitably encountered during corrective laparotomic omentectomy--are discussed. An evaluation is necessary concerning whether omentectomy acts as an independent risk factor for incisional hernia, and whether incisional hernia occurs more frequently when omentectomy is performed after a period on CAPD as compared with when it is performed at the time of PD catheter implantation. Laparotomic omentectomy should be performed as a last resort for the correction of PD catheter malposition.","571":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients have been shown to require less erythropoietin as compared with hemodialysis (HD) patients to maintain similar hemoglobin values. In our unit, we observed that diabetic PD patients required less erythropoietin treatment than did other PD patients. We therefore compared the amount of erythropoietin needed in diabetic and non diabetic patients on PD to maintain a similar hemoglobin value. All polycystic patients were excluded from the study because they rarely require erythropoietin. We also excluded patients with bone marrow disease, active gastrointestinal bleeding, or patients very resistant (requiring more than 25,000 U per week) to Eprex (recombinant human erythropoietin: Janssen-Cilag, North York, Ontario, Canada). Patients not requiring Eprex were also excluded from the study. We calculated the weekly erythropoietin dose in the two groups. We also compared hemoglobin level, iron transferrin saturation, vitamin?12 level, and serum folate. Diabetic patients required a lower weekly erythropoietin dose. Diabetic PD patients in our unti receive an average 4497 U per week compared with 7593 U per week for non diabetic PD patients. The difference (approximately 3000 U per week) is statistically significant.","572":"Intraperitoneal (i.p.) bleeding causes intense inflammatory reactions and extensive adhesions. The relationship between i.p. bleeding and adhesions is well documented in both animal and human studies. Over an 8-year period, we performed 362 permanent peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter placements in 317 patients, using the laparoscopic technique. In the first 203 procedures (group I), we observed intra-operative bleeding in 12 patients (intra-operative i.p. bleeding seen laparoscopically, and significant blood-tinged dialysate irrigation). Patients were left dry for 3-5 days before dialysate instillation during the break-in period. During the break-in period, 7 of the 12 patients (58%) developed primary catheter failure requiring catheter removal (p = 0.03). All 7 patients underwent repeat laparoscopy for placement of a new catheter. In all 7 patients, laparoscopy showed significant adhesions. In the subsequent 159 procedures (group II), we observed intra-operative bleeding in 10 patients. We irrigated the peritoneal cavity repeatedly, until clear dialysate was obtained, then instilled 500-1000 mL 1.5% Dianeal solution (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.) and capped the catheter. These patients were then placed on low-volume continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis [(CCPD) 700-1200 mL, based on the patient's size, every 2 hours, until the effluent became clear]. Following this, patients underwent daily irrigation and PD fluid cell count, and were left with 700-1200 mL dialysate to dwell. The process was continued until PD fluid drainage showed no red blood cells or until the patient was started on routine peritoneal dialysis. None of these patients were drained dry. Compared with group I, no patient among the 10 in group II developed catheter failure (p = 0.001), and mean catheter survival was 31 +\/- 7 months. Of the 10 patients, 2 developed exist-site leaks, both after clearance of red blood cells from the drained dialysate. None developed peritonitis. We conclude that intra-operative i.p. bleeding associated with significant blood-tinged dialysate irrigation may lead to local adhesions if the peritoneum is drained dry. The result may be loss of the PD catheter in about 60% of cases. Continuous irrigation, combined with a moderate amount of Dianeal solution left to dwell, or early initiation of low-volume PD, or both, prevents this complication.","573":"Compared with countries worldwide, the United States currently has one of the lowest peritoneal dialysis (PD) populations as compared with its hemodialysis (HD) population. Approximately 12% of the total dialysis population in the United State is on PD. This figure correlates with the take-on rate [percentage of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients enrolling in PD programs] of about 12%-15% in the United States. Over a two-year period, we prospectively examined the role that developing a comprehensive infrastructure and support system had on expanding our PD program. The changes made included these: nephrologists placing PD catheters using the laparoscopic method; active identification of, and training for, family members and personnel in nursing homes and daycare centers to perform PD; improvements in home conditions through support by social workers; early ESRD patient education; and provision of in-center intermittent PD (IPD) for selected patients. We then compared the results from the two years after commencement of the changes against the two years before the changes were made. Training of personnel in nursing homes increased enrollment from 3 to 11 patients (p = 0.01); training of personnel in daycare centers increased enrollment from 0 to 5 patients (p = 0.05); training family members and providing family support increased enrollment from 4 to 15 patients (p = 0.03); early patient and family education increased enrollment from 4 to 24 patients (p = 0.008); improving home conditions increased enrollment from 1 to 14 patients (p = 0.01); and providing an IPD program for selected patients added 6 patients (p = 0.05). Introducing a program for nephrologists to place PD catheters by the laparoscopic technique decreased catheter mechanical failure (and subsequent transfer to HD), from 22 to 3 patients (p = 0.005). Our PD take-on rate (percentage of ESRD patients choosing PD modality) increased from 19% to 76% (p = 0.002). The total number of patients in the PD program over the two years after initiation of the changes increased from 33 to 93 (p = 0.01), while the number of HD patients decreased from 168 to 142 (p = 0.05). Developing a comprehensive infrastructure and support system for PD programs permits enrollment of patients who otherwise would have been excluded as PD candidates and eliminates loss of PD patients to HD. Implementation of such programs can contribute considerably to enhancing the PD population growth rate.","574":"Three recent studies using registry data from the United States, in comparing the mortality risks between peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD), have consistently found that elderly diabetic women on PD have a higher mortality risk as compared with their counterparts on HD. Though the cause for this observation is not clear, the phenomenon may be unique to the United States. Alternatively, a selection bias impossible to decipher may be at work in these studies, as none of them have data on comorbidity, nutrition, or adequacy of dialysis. Finally, the possibility that elderly diabetic women are, for some reason, more vulnerable to the ill effects of peritoneal dialysis should be considered. We report here a retrospective analysis of 47 diabetic women, above 55 years of age, with end-stage renal disease, who were started on PD and who later died on dialysis. The primary outcome of interest was cause of death. Demographic details about the patients, comorbid conditions, dialysis adequacy, and biochemical parameters at the start of PD were noted. Death in these patients was attributed mainly to vascular causes, and there appeared to be a high prevalence of peripheral vascular disease. Infection was the next major cause of death, being the primary cause in 14 patients. Of these, only 5 patients had peritonitis. On a Cox regression analysis, only patient age and duration of diabetes at onset of dialysis were found to be predictive of vascular death. No factor was found to be predictive of death from infection. It appears that elderly diabetic women on PD die mainly of the long-term complications of diabetes.","575":"It is generally believed that, to achieve adequacy targets, anuric patients with a low-transport membrane should be treated by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or CAPD with a night-exchange device. If adequacy targets are not reached, it is suggested that patients should be changed to hemodialysis. We would like to show that a role still exists for cycler + therapy (cycler therapy with a wet day or with only one manual exchange) in these patients, both for obtaining target Kt\/V and for lifestyle. Using the PD Adequest computer program (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.), we compared a night-exchange device [3 exchanges during the day and 2 exchanges during the night (3 + 2)] to various regimes of cycler + therapy. In all cases, the night-exchange volume exceeded the day-exchange volume by 500 mL. Using cycler + therapy in anuric patients with a low-transport membrane, with 6-7 exchanges over 9 hours, Kt\/V can be increased by 10%-25%. A role therefore still exists for cycler + therapy in anuric patients with a low-transport membrane for lifestyle or to achieve a better Kt\/V. Unfortunately, we saw no significant improvement in creatinine clearance.","576":"Chronic renal failure (CRF) causes deterioration of the fluid, electrolyte, and acid-base balances, azotemia, and impairment of the structure and function of many systems. In the skeletal system, CRF changes both the quality and quantity of the bone through its multifactorial influence on bone metabolism, leading to osteopenia, osteoporosis, and increased risk of fracture. The aim of the present study was to work up the quickest and most sensitive schedule for detecting osteoporosis in chronic renal insufficiency patients treated with CAPD. Thirty-seven uremic patients were included in the study. Bone mineral density was measured by dual-energy x-ray absorptiometry in lumbar spine, femoral neck, forearm (33% distal and ultradistal sites), and total body. Analyzing all five sites, we made the assessment that the prevalence of osteoporosis in our group of patients reached 48.6%. If only one site was evaluated, the ultradistal part of forearm yielded the highest frequency of diagnosis of osteoporosis (37.8%). Next came the femoral neck and total body (21.6% each). When the two sites in the forearm were taken into account together, the incidence of osteoporosis reached 40.5%. We conclude that the quickest and most sensitive method of detecting osteoporosis in CAPD patients is to measure bone mass in both forearm sites (33% distal and ultradistal), then in the femoral neck.","577":"In peritoneal dialysis patients, polyglucose dialysis solution (PG-DS) influences serum levels of sodium, amylase, and lipase, and of iron parameters. We aimed to examine, in the blood or serum of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients treated with PG-DS, changes in the concentrations of Na+, K+, Ca++, total Ca, phosphorus, urea nitrogen, creatinine, uric acid, total protein, albumin, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH); in lipid profile [total cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol, low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol, triglycerides, HDL:total cholesterol ratio]; and in acid-base status. We started studies in 14 CAPD patients in whom 7.5% PG-DS was applied for the overnight 2-L exchange (duration: about 10 hours). Determinations of blood chemistry were carried out at 1.6 +\/- 0.8 months before the introduction of PG-DS (period I, n = 14); after 1.2 +\/- 0.6 months (period II, n = 14), 4.4 +\/- 0.8 months (period III, n = 11), and 8.8 +\/- 2.4 months (period IV, n = 9) of PG-DS administration; and 2.0 +\/- 0.6 months after PG-DS discontinuation (period V, n = 11). The most pronounced (significant) differences in the examined parameters were seen between periods I and III or periods I and IV for Na+ (140 +\/- 3 mmol\/L vs 136 +\/- 4 mmol\/L), K+ (4.2 +\/- 0.6 mmol\/L vs 4.8 +\/- 0.6 mmol\/L), total Ca (9.4 +\/- 1.1 mg\/dL vs 10.5 +\/- 1.3 mg\/dL), urea nitrogen (61.3 +\/- 25.9 mg\/dL vs 79.4 +\/- 20.9 mg\/dL), creatinine (10.7 +\/- 2.6 mg\/dL vs 12.8 +\/- 4.3 mg\/dL), uric acid (4.8 +\/- 2.3 mg\/dL vs 7.1 +\/- 1.7 mg\/dL), and total protein (61.7 +\/- 10.8 g\/L vs 70.5 +\/- 8.0 g\/L). Serum lipid levels were stable during PG-DS administration, but they increased after discontinuation of the PG-DS. Other studied parameters usually returned to pre-treatment values after PG-DS discontinuation. All patients were in good clinical status during the study. The changes in blood chemistry did not cause clinical intervention. Our results indicate that PG-DS influences blood chemistry. The observed differences need to be clinically analyzed.","578":"The present study evaluated whether estimation of lymphocyte subset counts can be more helpful than total lymphocyte count (TLC) in earlier diagnosis of immune and nutritional changes in the course of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). For the study, 50 CAPD patients were divided into four groups depending on dialysis duration. Group I consisted of patients treated for 6-12 months (n = 15); group II, for 13-24 months (n = 16); group III, for 25-36 months (n = 12); and group IV, for more than 36 months (n = 7). Thirteen patients, being 8 +\/- 7 days before CAPD initiation, were included in group 0. Flow cytometry was used for estimation of lymphocyte subsets (determination of CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, and CD16 + 56 antigens). Our uremic patients started CAPD therapy with decreased TLC and lymphocyte subset (excluding CD16 + 56) counts. After 6-12 months of CAPD therapy, a significant increase in TLC, CD4:CD8 ratio, and all examined lymphocyte subset counts was observed. In the next years of CAPD therapy, TLC, CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD19 cell counts decreased. In patients on CAPD for more than 36 months, CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD19 cell counts were below the normal range, but mean TLC was maintained in the normal range, and CD16 + 56 exceeded the upper limit of normal. A significant negative correlation between CD19 cell count and dialysis duration was seen (r = -0.298, p = 0.035, n = 50). In conclusion, the first months of CAPD therapy see an improvement in immune and nutritional status as expressed by an increase in TLC, lymphocyte subset counts, and CD4:CD8 ratio. Repeat determinations of CD3, CD4, CD8, and CD19 cell counts indicate that these counts decrease earlier than an evaluation of TLC indicates. We recommend lymphocyte subset determinations for detection of immune and nutritional abnormalities in the course of CAPD treatment. An increase in natural killer cells above the normal range may reflect chronic sterile or infectious inflammatory response, which deteriorates nutritional status.","579":"","580":"","581":"Peritoneal mesothelial cells are important for local host defense and membrane integrity. Dialysate cancer antigen 125 (dCA125) has been shown to be a good marker for the mesothelial cell mass in adult peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. In children on PD, no information is available yet. We measured dCA125 in 65 dialysate samples from 24 PD children with a median age of 9.2 years (range: 2-18 years) and a median treatment time of 2.6 years (range: 0.1-9.3 years) on PD. The median dCA125 concentration was 8 U\/mL (range: 2.3-30.7 U\/mL), and the CA125 appearance rate (CA125AR) was 66.5 U\/min\/1.73 m2 (range: 18-282 U\/min\/1.73 m2). On cross-sectional analysis, a negative correlation was found between dCA125 and duration of PD treatment (r = -0.3, p = 0.04). No relation was found between age and dCA125 or CA125AR when the first measurement from each child was considered. No correlation was found between dCA125 and the mass transfer area coefficient of creatinine (MTACcreat). Longitudinal analysis showed a negative trend in CA125AR with duration of PD treatment (p = 0.03). No relation was found between peritonitis incidence and dCA125 or CA125AR. In conclusion, no influence of age on dCA125 and CA125AR was found. Levels of dCA125 declined with the duration of PD treatment, reflecting mesothelial cell mass, but they did not correlate with the MTACcreat or the peritonitis incidence in stable PD children.","582":"Nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus is a risk factor for catheter-related infections with S. aureus in patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD). In children, S. aureus may transmitted to the catheter either from the patients' nares, or from the nares of caregiving carriers. As part of a prospective trial on the efficacy of mupirocin prophylaxis in children on CPD and their caregivers, we evaluated the prevalence of S. aureus carriage in 92 families of pediatric CPD patients. Patients and their caregivers (usually both parents) were screened by three nasal cultures obtained within four weeks. In 62% of the families, neither the patients nor any caregiver carried S. aureus. In 23%, the patient or at least one caregiver (sometimes both) was identified as a carrier. In 15%, at least one caregiver, but not the patient, was colonized with S. aureus. During further follow-up by once-monthly nasal cultures, 5 of the 57 initially negative patients developed S. aureus colonization, and in two families, at least one caregiver turned positive. Including these \"occasional\" carriers, the cumulative likelihood of one or several family members carrying S. aureus gradually increased to a plateau of about 55% after 6 observation months. Susceptibility rates of cultured S. aureus were 100% for vancomycin, 99% for aminoglycosides, 95% for piperacillin\/tazobactam, 94% for cephalosporins, and 15% for ampicillin. In two patients and two caregivers (four different families), methicillin-resistant S. aureus was found. Three isolates from three different families were resistant to mupirocin. We conclude that S. aureus colonization is common in families of children on CPD. While 85% of carrier families are detected by 3 sequential nose cultures in patient and caregivers, up to 9 cultures may be required in \"occasional\" carriers.","583":"In the last decade, it has became apparent that the prescribed fill volume (IPV) in children on peritoneal dialysis (PD) should be expressed per body surface area (BSA in square meters) to avoid a false perception of peritoneal hyperpermeability as determined during a peritoneal equilibration test [PET, dialysate-to-plasma (D\/P) ratio]. Nevertheless, the optimal IPV in terms of both tolerance and effectiveness remains under discussion. An individual approach to IPV prescription might balance the measurement of the intraperitoneal pressure, the use of the mass transfer coefficient despite the D\/P ratio, and a determination of the effective peritoneal area available for exchanges. Considering these parameters, we usually found the individual optimal fill volume to be less than 1400 mL\/m2.","584":"The presence of a colostomy in infants with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) is associated with an inherent risk for contamination and the development of a PD catheter-associated infection. A two-piece presternal catheter designed to reduce the incidence of such infections has been used in a small number of children, but the implantation of the catheter is technically difficult, and there is a risk of disconnection of the two parts secondary to rapid patient growth in the first year of life. Alternatively, a conventional Swan neck catheter, larger than typically required, can be placed with its exit site located on the chest wall. Over the past three years, we adopted this novel approach in two patients with ESRD and a colostomy in whom PD catheters were placed at ages 4 days and 12 days, respectively. During a combined follow-up of 50 months, only one episode of peritonitis and no episodes of exit-site or tunnel infection have been observed. This experience supports the use of this unique approach to PD catheter placement in infants with ESRD and a colostomy.","585":"This study examined the effect on patient lipid profile of commencing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). We followed eighteen non diabetic, non nephrotic patients for 9 months before and after dialysis commencement and compared lipid profiles. Mean cholesterol levels rose from 4.98 mmol\/L to 5.42 mmol\/L (p &lt; 0.05). This change was chiefly due to a rise in low density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol. The LDL cholesterol rose after dialysis commencement and continued to rise up to 9 months later. High-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol remained stable. Serum albumin and body weight fell during follow-up, suggesting that the rise in cholesterol was not a reflection of enhanced nutritional status. This study highlights the pro-atherogenic change in lipids that results from commencing CAPD. This phenomenon is not seen in hemodialysis, and it should be considered when selecting a dialysis modality, given the increased risk of cardiovascular disease in the dialysis population.","586":"Polyneuropathy is one of the most frequent manifestations in chronic uremia. Among the factors related to polyneuropathy, vitamin B6 deficiency is well known. The exact prevalence of vitamin B6 deficiency related to neurological manifestations has not been previously reported. We studied vitamin B6 status, collected self-reported symptoms, and carried out full neurological examinations in 66 patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis. Vitamin B6 status was estimated by direct measurement of pyridoxal phosphate. In general, symptoms related to vitamin B6 deficiency are peripheral neuropathies, such as paresthesia, burning and painful dysesthesias, and thermal sensations. These symptoms were reported and assigned one of five grade scores. Of our 66 patients, 12 patients complained at least one sensory abnormality. The levels of vitamin B6 in the patients varied between 1.0 ng\/mL and 30 ng\/mL. Patients who complained of neurological symptoms owing to vitamin B6 deficiency were significantly older than the other patients. In analyzing the symptomatic cases before and after vitamin B6 supplementation, a significant correlation was seen between the level of vitamin B6 and symptoms. Within one month after initiation of oral vitamin B6 supplementations (30 mg daily), levels of pyridoxal phosphate rose, and sensory abnormalities improved in 8 of 12 patients. When peripheral neuropathy is suspected in elderly patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis, vitamin B6 deficiency should be taken into consideration as the cause. If vitamin B6 deficiency is appropriately treated by oral supplementation, sensory abnormalities can be eliminated.","587":"Controversy exists among various studies in regard to the efficacy of oral (p.o.) versus parenteral calcitriol. Some studies suggest that intravenous (i.v.) calcitriol is superior to p.o. calcitriol for treating renal osteodystrophy in hemodialysis patients; others suggest that these routes of administration are equivalent. To our knowledge, no large, prospective, randomized study compares intraperitoneal (i.p.) to p.o. calcitriol in adult peritoneal dialysis patients. We conducted a prospective randomized study in 76 patients (38 on i.p. calcitriol and 38 on p.o. calcitriol), whom we followed for 48 months. Of the 76 patients, 34 (18 in the i.p. group and 16 in the p.o. group) completed the 48-month study period. Calcitriol dosing was similar in both groups (3-6 micrograms per week in three divided doses). Dose adjustments were made depending on levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH), serum calcium, phosphorus, and calcitriol. No significant difference was seen between the groups in regard to age, sex, race, body mass index, dialysis duration, or cause of ESRD. Neither was any difference in the incidence of peritonitis seen between the groups. In the first 3-6 months, PTH decreased equivalently in both groups. The PTH level remained suppressed in the i.p. group throughout the remainder of the study, but, in the p.o. group, PTH returned to its pretreatment level after 3-6 months. Mean serum calcium was not different in the two groups. In the p.o. group, a considerably higher mean follow-up phosphorus level (6.8 +\/- 2.3 mg\/dL versus 4.7 +\/- 1.4 mg\/dL, p = 0.008), PTH level (384 +\/- 146 pg\/mL versus 162 +\/- 64 pg\/mL; p = 0.005), and alkaline phosphatase level (178 +\/- 37 IU\/L versus 72 +\/- 21 IU\/L, p = 0.02) were seen as compared to the i.p. group. In the i.p. group, resolution of osteodystrophy occurred in all patients at the end of the study; in the p.o. group, 5 patients maintained or developed osteodystrophy by the end of the study (p = 0.016). We conclude that i.p. calcitriol is more effective than pulse p.o. calcitriol in lowering PTH and alkaline phosphatase levels and in resolving renal osteodystrophy, and that i.p. calcitriol is associated with a lower incidence of hyperphosphatemia and elevated Ca x PO4 byproduct.","588":"This study was carried out to investigate the role of aquaporin (AQP) in the peritoneum undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Furthermore, we examined the effects of treatment with prednisolone (PSL) in a rat model of peritoneal sclerosis. We modelled peritoneal sclerosis by using dialysis solution with the addition of 0.1% chlorhexidine gluconate (CHG) for 10 days. Twenty male Wistar Kyoto (WKY) rats were divided into four groups and dialyzed with various solutions: (1) saline (NS group, n = 5); (2) 10% glucose (TZ group, n = 5); (3) 0.1% CHG (CHG group, n = 5); and (4) 0.1% CHG plus PSL (CHG + PSL group, n = 5). Expression of mRNA of AQPs (AQP-1-AQP-4) was studied by semi-quantitative reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Expression of AQP-4 was also measured by Western blot analysis. Ultrafiltration volume and peritoneal function were measured by the peritoneal equilibration test. In the TZ group, expression of AQP-1 and AQP-4 were significantly enhanced, in parallel with an increment in ultrafiltration volume. On the other hand, in the CHG group, expression of AQP-1 and AQP-4 were significantly suppressed, and ultrafiltration volume was lost. The use of PSL with CHG completely restored the expression of AQP-1 and AQP-4, and peritoneal function improved. No expression of AQP-2 and AQP-3 was seen in the peritoneum. Our results suggest that AQP-1 and AQP-4 may be important factors in water transport in patients undergoing CAPD. PSL might be an effective treatment to prevent the progress of peritoneal sclerosis in patients undergoing CAPD.","589":"Adynamic bone disease (ABD) has an increasing prevalence in the dialysis population, more so in peritoneal dialysis patients. Anemia in patients with high turnover bone disease and high intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) tends to be resistant to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). The same problem may occur in patients with ABD; however, data are scarce. This study evaluates the effectiveness of rHuEPO in 32 chronic peritoneal dialysis patients, 9 with iPTH levels below 100 pg\/mL for more than 6 months (group A, with ABD) and 23 with iPTH levels above 100 pg\/mL (group B, without ABD). In group A and group B respectively, the dosage of rHuEPO was 141.8 +\/- 59 U\/kg\/week and 144.8 +\/- 77 U\/kg\/week, and hematocrit was 33.2% +\/- 4.3% and 31.7% +\/- 4.5% (p &gt; 0.05). Iron indices, nutritional parameters, and bone indices were similar, except that group A had lower alkaline phosphatase and serum ferritin levels. The data suggest that patients with ABD may not be resistant to rHuEPO, but may even have a slightly better hematocrit at a similar rHuEPO dosage. Further studies in a larger number of patients are needed to confirm these findings.","590":"Malnutrition is an important determinant of outcome in patients on dialysis. Its cause is multifactorial and its detection is important when patients embark on dialysis. In this study, we used various indices to assess the prevalence of malnutrition as reflected in protein intake, anthropometric effect, and serum protein level. To avoid the effect that dialysis has on malnutrition, we studied 37 patients who had just started continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Of these new patients, 42% had a residual urea clearance below 1.0 mL\/min. In 51% of the patients, serum albumin level was below 33 g\/L; in 14%, body mass index was below 19; and in 39%, dietary protein intake was below 0.8 g per kilogram of body weight per day. A total of 76% of our patients had at least one of these three indices. In 8% of the patients, lean body mass was below 60%. We conclude that protein malnutrition is a significant problem in our patients starting CAPD. Dialysis-dependent factors were not implicated, as the patients were studied at the start of dialysis. Low intake of protein was a major problem and may have contributed significantly to malnutrition. The low residual urea clearance implied that dialysis was started relatively late and may have contributed to the low protein intake.","591":"The index patient is a 23-year-old female with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) secondary to chemotherapeutic agents. Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) has been the renal replacement therapy for the past 5 years since a failed cadaveric renal transplant. Past medical history was significant for diabetes mellitus, hypertension, anemia, bilateral subclavian vein thrombosis with superior vena cava syndrome, secondary hyperparathyroidism, leukemia (at age 8), and hyperlipidemia. On presentation, soft tissue nodules were noted in the anterolateral surfaces of the legs. After 3 months of continued low-calcium-dialysate CCPD, calcitriol, and oral phosphate binders, a 2 x 3 cm nodule was noted on the posterior aspect of the thorax at the scapula. The only complaint at this time was shoulder pain at the acromioclavicular joint. Radiological examination revealed a 3 x 4 cm soft tissue opacity in the superior segment of the left lower lobe laterally. Despite a prior subtotal parathyroidectomy, phosphate binders, and calcitriol, the parathyroid hormone levels continued to increase, with development of tumoral calcinosis, worsening renal osteodystrophy, and calciphylaxis. Computed tomography examination revealed extensive soft tissue calcification consistent with tumoral calcinosis. An ulcerative lesion (1 cm) developed on the lateral aspect of the upper thigh owing to warfarin necrosis versus calciphylaxis. At this time, the phosphate binder was changed from calcium acetate to sevelamer hydrochloride. Aggressive wound treatment and aggressive calcium and phosphate control added to the treatment regimen has resulted in healing of the single ulcer and a decrease in the size of the tumoral lesions. In conclusion, early recognition and aggressive treatment of calciphylaxis can result in reduced morbidity and mortality from calciphylaxis in ESRD patients.","592":"Peritonitis is the most common complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) and accounts for the most drop-out from PD among patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Antibiotic protocols to treat peritonitis recommend initial treatment for both gram-positive and gram-negative infections, pending culture results. Current literature also suggests comparable therapeutic success using bolus (single-dose) parenteral aminoglycosides to treat systemic gram-negative infections compared to conventional divided-dose aminoglycosides. The single bolus dose antibiotic regimen has the potential for reduced nephrotoxicity and ototoxicity. We therefore hypothesized that intermittent bolus dose intraperitoneal (i.p.) aminoglycosides may be superior to conventional continuous dose i.p. aminoglycosides in treating dialysis-associated peritonitis, and have fewer side effects. Six patients with clinical peritonitis were treated with single, bolus-dose, i.p. gentamicin or tobramycin (5 mg\/kg ideal body weight), range 250-440 mg (mean: 355 +\/- 68.25 mg) at the start of therapy. No patient grew gram-negative organisms; aminoglycosides were therefore not repeated. Three patients used four continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) exchanges per day; three patients used six nightly continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) exchanges with a daytime dwell. Mean PD aminoglycoside clearance was 6.75 +\/- 2.27 mm3\/min; mean urinary aminoglycoside clearance was 5.75 +\/- 1.14 mm3\/min. Mean blood aminoglycoside elimination t1\/2 was 29.27 +\/- 3.55 hours, with a mean blood level of 3.18 +\/- 1.45 micrograms\/mL 72 hours after initial therapy, and 1.52 +\/- 0.81 micrograms\/mL 96 hours after initial therapy. Peritoneal equilibration test (PET) scores before and after aminoglycoside administration (performed a mean of 4.6 months apart) were 0.672 +\/- 0.097 and 0.705 +\/- 0.092 respectively (p = 0.321). Comparative audiograms using pure-air tone conduction with frequencies from 250-12,000 Hz were done within 24 hours of aminoglycosides and again when therapy was complete (mean: 17 days). No significant changes were seen. While efficacy of bolus versus conventional-use aminoglycosides could not be definitely established, the kinetics of bolus aminoglycosides suggests that therapeutic blood levels persist for 72-96 hours and that the risk for oto\/vestibular toxicity is negligible. We conclude that use of bolus i.p. aminoglycosides is safe, achieves therapeutic blood levels for extended intervals, demonstrates no clinical oto\/vestibular toxicity, is cost-effective, and is a convenient strategy for patients and nursing staff.","593":"We conducted a prospective bacteriologic study of 89 peritoneal catheters removed from 77 peritoneal dialysis patients. Reasons for catheter removal included severe peritonitis (n = 36, Group A), persistent exit-site infection (n = 29, Group B), and dormant, seemingly uninfected catheters (n = 22, Group C). We studied the external cuff (EC) and internal cuff (IC) as well as the catheter tip. In Group A, microbial growth was seen in 86.1% of ECs, 66.7% of ICs, and 67.6% of tips. In cases of positive isolation, concordance was 91.7% IC versus EC, 84.2% IC versus tip, and 80.0% EC versus tip. The peritonitis agent was recovered from 61.1% of ECs, 50.0% of ICs, and 55.6% of tips. In Group B, colonization was seen in 72.4% of ECs, 44.8% of ICs, and 31.0% of tips. When an isolation was obtained from both EC and IC, concordance was 81.8%. The exit-site infection agent was recovered from 69% of ECs and 24% of ICs. In Group C, microbial growth was observed in 77.3% of ECs, 45.5% of ICs, and 31.8% of tips. Gram-positive bacteria predominated, with the same bacteria colonizing EC and IC in 66.7% of cases. In conclusion, removed peritoneal catheters present a high prevalence of extensive microbial colonization, even in the absence of overt infection.","594":"Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage (SANC) is a risk factor for development of S. aureus dialysis-related infections. Reported here are results of a SANC surveillance and treatment program employed by our dialysis unit over a two-year period. Surveillance nasal cultures were performed at 3-month intervals in 129 peritoneal dialysis patients. Those with SANC applied mupirocin ointment intranasally 3 times daily for 5 consecutive days for 3 consecutive months. Treatment was repeated only when subsequent cultures showed SANC. Infection and catheter loss rates were compared to 63 historical controls, and between SANC and non SANC patients of the study group. Patients who were initially non carriers showed increasing probability for acquiring SANC throughout the study period. Following treatment, the probability for recurrence of SANC was 26%, 41%, 58%, and 62% at 1, 3, 6, and 12 months. The rates of S. aureus exit-site or tunnel infection (p = 0.36), peritonitis (p = 0.0002), and catheter loss (p = 0.01) were lower in the study group as compared to controls. Despite treatment, SANC patients demonstrated a twofold increase in exit-site\/tunnel infection rate (p = 0.03) and a threefold increase in catheter loss rate (p = 0.1) as compared to non SANC patients. The high rate of SANC recurrence and the long interval between surveillance cultures may explain the failure of the current protocol to completely eliminate the risk for S. aureus infections. The results support a change in the treatment plan to that of continuing the monthly mupirocin regimen indefinitely once SANC has been identified.","595":"Various authors have found peritonitis rates in older peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients to be higher, similar, or even lower when compared to rates in younger populations. We prospectively analyzed all episodes of peritonitis registered in the 381 patients (219 males, 162 females; mean age, 55.5 +\/- 17.0 years) who were treated with PD during four years (1993-1996) in our multicenter group. Patients were distributed into two groups. Group A included 138 patients aged 65 years or over (mean age: 72.3 +\/- 5.1 years); group B included 243 patients aged below 65 years (mean age: 46.0 +\/- 13.6 years). No differences were seen in general PD characteristics. Normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) was higher in younger patients (p = 0.001). Patients in group A experienced more peritonitis (135 episodes; 1 episode per 16.7 patient-months) than patients in group B (198 episodes; 1 episode per 21.7 patient-months; p = 0.01). Although no differences were seen in the general characteristics of the peritonitis episodes, gram-negative peritonitis and peritonitis not achieving a cure were more commonly secondary to enteric bacteria in group A (p = 0.03). We conclude that PD patients aged 65 years or over are at higher risk of peritonitis. Also, in this age group, gram-negative peritonitis and peritonitis with any evolution except cure are more likely to be due to enteric bacteria.","596":"We studied acute and chronic intraperitoneal inflammation during dialysis performed in rats injected with phosphate-buffered saline alone (PBS) or PBS supplemented with glucose (Glu) or with mannitol (Man). In acute experiments, the result of a first dialysis with PBS in every rat (dialysis I) was compared with a second dialysis performed 24 hours later (dialysis II) using a different dialysis fluid: either PBS with 3.86 g\/dL Man or PBS with 3.86 g\/dL Glu. In rats exposed to hypertonic dialysis solutions (both Glu and Man), inflammatory reaction was decreased (cell count: p &lt; 0.05; nitric oxide secretion: p &lt; 0.05; protein in dialysate: p &lt; 0.05). In control animals treated only with PBS (dialysis I and dialysis II), the inflammatory reactions during dialysis I and dialysis II were comparable. In chronic experiments, rats were dialyzed with the tested fluids for four weeks. Weekly, dialysate samples were taken and analyzed. At the end of the study, cell counts and protein losses were higher in the PBS-treated rats than in the other groups (cell count: p &lt; 0.05, Glu vs PBS, and p &lt; 0.05, Man vs PBS; protein in dialysate: p &lt; 0.001, Glu vs PBS, and p &lt; 0.01, Man vs PBS). We conclude that hypertonicity of the dialysis fluid inhibits the inflammatory reaction in the peritoneal cavity during peritoneal dialysis.","597":"The objective of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of mupirocin on Staphylococcus aureus with regard to peritoneal dialysis (PD)-catheter exit-site infections (ESI), tunnel infections (TI), and peritonitis episodes (PE). The study was performed on 42 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients (group I) treated from April 1998 to July 1999. These patients were instructed to apply mupirocin daily at the catheter exit site as part of their exit-site care. The control was the same group's historical infection data. Results were also recorded for a second group of 16 patients (group II) with newly implanted PD catheters were also instructed to apply mupirocin at the exit site daily. During the control period (before daily mupirocin application), group I recorded 16 episodes of ESI (0.30 episodes per patient-year), 6 episodes of TI (0.11 episodes per patient-year), 15 episodes of PE (0.28 episodes per patient-year), and one case of catheter removal (0.019 episodes per patient-year) owing to S. aureus exit-site infection coexisting with peritonitis. The rate of S. aureus exit-site infection during this period was 0.11 episodes per patient-year; of S. aureus tunnel infection, 0.057 episodes per patient-year; and of S. aureus peritonitis, 0.076 episodes per patient-year. During the mupirocin period, infections and peritonitis owing to S. aureus dramatically decreased (p &lt; 0.01 and p &lt; 0.001 respectively). The rate of S. aureus exit-site infection was 0.02 episodes per patient-year, with no S. aureus tunnel infections, and no catheter removals owing to S. aureus peritonitis. Similarly, in group II, no episodes were recorded of any ESI, TI, or PE owing to S. aureus, although 4 episodes of ESI (0.37 episodes per patient-year, 2 with other gram-positive bacteria, and 2 with gram-negative bacteria) and 8 PEs (0.75 episodes per patient-year) were seen. We conclude that mupirocin application provides excellent prophylaxis for catheter-related infections owing to S. aureus, and that reduction of these infections may improve the long-term survival of patients on CAPD.","598":"Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) is recognized as a serious complication of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). To date, in our hospital, 12 cases of SEP have been successfully treated by active intervention. The development of SEP was observed in these patients after removal of a peritoneal catheter. SEP was relieved by steroid administration in 3 of these patients, and by total parenteral nutrition (TPN) performed after exploratory laparotomy in 1 patient. In the remaining 8 patients, SEP was relieved by total intestinal enterolysis. In patients who underwent total intestinal enterolysis, the severity of encapsulation and adhesion varied. White, rigid encapsulation was observed in 4 patients who had been treated by peritoneal dialysis (PD) for less than 10 years. Seemingly normal serosae were observed under the capsules, and total intestinal enterolysis was easily performed in these patients. In the patient who underwent renal transplantation, more severe intestinal adhesion was observed, although the duration of PD was limited to 70 months and the intestinal serosae were seemingly normal. These findings were considered specific to SEP developing after immunosuppressant administration. In 3 patients who had undergone PD for more than 10 years, degeneration of the visceral peritoneum was observed, together with an ill-defined boundary between the capsules and the serosae. Therefore, total enterolysis was performed in these patients, including a wide area of the muscular layer. Furthermore, calcification was observed in several regions, where the capsules were severely adherent to the parietal peritoneum. The post-operative course for all 8 patients was satisfactory, and these patients finally returned to their previous social activities. We conclude that when SEP symptoms are not improved by steroid administration or TPN, active total intestinal enterolysis should be performed. However, it is absolutely important to avoid inducing anastomosis or impairing the intestine.","599":"Staphylococcus aureus is frequently isolated from patients with infections related to continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). In many cases, the organism is also isolated simultaneously from the anterior nares. To clarify the transmission trail of S. aureus, we used DNA analysis to identify clonotypes of clinical strains. The nares and exit sites of 32 CAPD patients were swabbed, and PD fluid samples were taken for pathogen culture. Genome DNA of S. aureus was digested with restriction enzyme Sma I for pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. We also asked the patients how they usually performed the PD procedure. S. aureus was isolated from 4 patients, including 3 who hosted two strains isolated separately from different sites. The DNA patterns of the strains isolated from these latter 3 patients were identical. However, the clonotypes from all 4 patients were different. Most of the patients did not wash their hands and wear masks while exchanging PD bags and caring for their exit sites. After the patients were disinfected and re-educated in proper procedures, S. aureus was not detected in any of them. These data suggest that no outbreak occurred in our hospital and that the vectors of endogenous infection were the patients themselves, probably their hands. A bacteriological study presents an efficient opportunity to re-educate patients in PD procedure.","600":"Many factors contribute to the development of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) peritonitis. The role of climate in CAPD peritonitis has received relatively little attention. We retrospectively analyzed the incidence of CAPD peritonitis according to temperature and relative humidity. Data from 80 patients were examined. The monthly mean temperature and relative humidity during study period varied between -3.4 degrees C and 25.4 degrees C and between 61% and 81%, respectively. In 1123 patient-months, 53 cases of peritonitis occurred. The occurrence of peritonitis paralleled temperature and relative humidity, being the highest (0.180 episodes\/patient-month) in July (mean temperature, 24.6 degrees C; relative humidity, 81%) and lowest (0.013 episodes\/patient-month) in November (mean temperature, 6.6 degrees C; relative humidity, 66%). Significant correlations were seen between the monthly frequency of CAPD peritonitis and temperature (r = 0.53, p &lt; 0.05) and relative humidity (r = 0.59, p &lt; 0.05). The incidence was higher in the warm season (months with a mean temperature &gt; or = 15 degrees C, that is, May-September) than in the cold season (months with a mean temperature &lt; 15 degrees C, that is, October-April), at 0.074 episodes\/patient-month versus 0.024 episodes\/patient-month, p &lt; 0.05. We also found a tendency for gram-negative peritonitis to occur uniformly throughout the year, but for gram-positive peritonitis to increase during hot and humid months, especially the rainy month of July. Gram-positive organisms caused 50% of peritonitis from March to August, but just 17.7% from September to February. Gram-negative organisms caused 7.3% and 29.4% of peritonitis during the same periods (p &lt; 0.05). The results indicate a clear seasonal change in the rate of CAPD peritonitis and in the causative micro-organisms. The observation that CAPD peritonitis increases in the season of high temperature and high humidity suggests the influence of climate on CAPD peritonitis in the temperate zone.","601":"We encountered two hemodialysis (HD) patients with recurrent infections and complete immunoglobulin A deficiency (IgAD). To survey the possibility of a similar occurrence in other populations, we conducted the present study. We used nephelometry to examine the levels of immunoglobulins G (IgG), A (IgA), and M (IgM) in 42 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, 246 HD patients, 56 chronic renal failure (CRF) patients, and 250 normal adults. Four CAPD patients (9.5%) and five HD patients (2.0%) were found to be completely IgA deficient (IgA &lt; 6.67 mg\/dL). Peritoneal dialysis patients therefore had a significantly higher prevalence of IgAD compared with HD and CRF patients. The underlying diseases leading to dialysis therapy in the IgAD patients varied. Their dialysis durations also varied. The occurrence rate of peritonitis in CAPD patients with IgAD was no higher than in patients without IgAD. The clinical significance of IgAD was focused on mucosal immunity, but the exact prevalence of infection was difficult to define. However, these patients' medical records did suggest more frequent respiratory tract infections and cellulitis events than did the records of patients without IgAD. Two PD patients with IgAD died of pneumonia. Immunodiffusion and indirect ELISA methods were used to detect the presence of auto-antibodies, successfully identifying them in three patients. Further research is needed to study other mechanisms of IgAD.","602":"Some studies have demonstrated the efficacy and safety of intraperitoneal (i.p.) urokinase in the resolution of recurrent or relapsing peritonitis, while others have not. Most studies were small, and they varied in methodology. Furthermore, the role of i.p. urokinase in shortening the duration of peritonitis or in preventing recurrence after initial peritonitis has not been examined. In addition, no previous studies have examined the role of i.p. urokinase in preventing, after first infection, catheter loss due to unresolving (resistant) peritonitis. Over a period of 3 years, we prospectively randomized into two groups all peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients who developed a first episode of peritonitis. Group I (n = 40) received i.p. urokinase on the first day of diagnosis (5000 IU intraluminally in the peritoneal catheter and left for 4 hours before next exchange). Group II (n = 40) received no urokinase. The duration of peritonitis was assessed by daily PD fluid white blood cell (WBC) count. Indications for catheter removal were: persistent peritonitis after four days from initiation of antibiotic therapy, or peritonitis with multiple organisms, suggesting bowel perforation. No statistically significant difference was seen between the two groups in regard to primary cause of end-stage renal disease (ESRD), age, sex, race, weight, type of dialysis [continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), automated peritoneal dialysis (APD), continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD)], or duration of dialysis prior to first peritonitis. No statistically significant difference was seen between the two groups in the duration of peritonitis or in the severity of symptoms and signs of peritonitis. Neither was any difference seen in the peritonitis recurrence or relapse rate (10% in the urokinase group vs 7.5% in the control group). Nine patients lost their catheters (3 in the urokinase group: 1 Pseudomonas aeruginosa and 2 Candida tropicalis; 6 in the control group: 1 Klebsiella pneumonia, 1 enterococcus, 2 Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and 2 Candida tropicalis). The difference in the rate of catheter loss between the two groups was not statistically significant; it appeared to relate to the type of organism rather than to the response to urokinase. In conclusion, i.p. urokinase plays no significant role in shortening the course of peritonitis or in preventing recurrence or loss of the PD catheter. Loss of PD catheters in patients having their first peritonitis appears to be related primarily to the type of organism causing the infection.","603":"The increased use of automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) and the inherent differences between continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and APD have generated interest in the treatment of peritonitis in cycler patients. This review considers variations in the incidence of peritonitis and in its microbiological spectrum among CAPD and APD patients, and discusses the potential causes for these variations, with emphasis on recent literature. Flow-pattern variances between CAPD and APD demand special considerations in the diagnosis of peritonitis. Multiple alternatives for the management of peritonitis in APD are discussed in light of recent clinical experiences and pharmacokinetic considerations.","604":"A variable degree of diffuse peritoneal fibrosis has been documented in all patients who have been on long-term peritoneal dialysis. Peritoneal dialysis-induced diffuse peritoneal fibrosis varies from opacification and \"tanning\" of the peritoneum, which may have only a moderate detrimental effect on peritoneal transport kinetics, to a progressive, sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP), which may lead to cessation of peritoneal dialysis and to death. Fewer than 1% of peritoneal dialysis patients develop overt SEP as manifested by combinations of intestinal obstruction, weight loss, and ultrafiltration failure. The diagnosis of SEP depends on a combination of laparotomy and radiological features in suspected cases and consequently the true incidence of SEP is most likely underestimated. Several predisposing, interrelated risk factors for both peritoneal fibrosis and sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis have been identified: prolonged duration of peritoneal dialysis, history of severe or recurrent episodes of peritonitis, and higher exposure to hypertonic glucose-based dialysis solutions. Nevertheless, the etiology of SEP is unknown and several causal factors may simultaneously or sequentially initiate and maintain a low-grade serositis that leads to uncontrolled fibroneogenesis. The high mortality rate of SEP has emphasized the need to develop preventive strategies. These strategies include early peritoneal catheter removal to avoid refractory peritonitis, the development of more biocompatible dialysis solutions, restriction of the use of hypertonic glucose-based dialysis solutions during and after episodes of peritonitis, and, perhaps, limiting the duration of peritoneal dialysis in at-risk patients. This approach was followed in a Japanese unit where a subgroup of all patients who had been on peritoneal dialysis for more than 5 years and who had poor ultrafiltration and peritoneal calcification on computed tomography (CT) scan were shown to have peritoneal sclerosis on peritoneal biopsy and were therefore electively transferred to hemodialysis. This acquired spectrum of peritoneal fibrosing syndromes leads to long-term complications in peritoneal dialysis, whereas localized fibrous adhesions secondary to prior abdominal surgery may prevent the successful initiation of peritoneal dialysis.","605":"Peritonitis and exit-site infections are the main causes of complications in peritoneal dialysis. Death due to infectious complication is also one of the major causes of drop-out. The underlying cause of infection may include malnutrition. Total creatinine appearance (TCA) may reflect overall nutritional status. We determined TCA from the daily dialysate, urine, and estimated gut creatinine of patients and normalized it to actual body weight (nTCA). We examined the relationship between nTCA and the incidence of infection, and between nTCA and infection-related survival. The study included 323 adult patients in a single dialysis center. The mean nTCA of all patients was 19.73 +\/- 4.75 mg\/kg\/day. The patients with an nTCA below 1 standard deviation from the mean (nTCA &lt; 14.98 mg\/kg\/day) had a significantly higher peritonitis and exit-site infection rate (p &lt; 0.01) and a higher chance of drop-out owing to infection-related complications (p &lt; 0.0001). Our study concluded that the adult patient with malnutrition (nTCA &lt; 14.98 mg\/kg\/day) has higher risk of infection.","606":"Anti-alpha-galactosyl antibodies (anti-Gal) seemingly mediate rejection of pig organs transplanted into humans and Old World monkeys. These natural antibodies appear to be produced by a subpopulation of B cells residing in the peritoneum. Therefore, peritoneal dialysis (PD) may have an impact on anti-Gal levels. In this cross-sectional study, blood anti-Gal levels were quantified by ELISA in 17 patients undergoing PD and 18 patients undergoing hemodialysis (HD), and the results were compared with those from a control group of 30 healthy blood donors. The effects of the mode of dialysis therapy and other epidemiologic variables on anti-Gal levels were also evaluated. The PD and HD patients were comparable with regards to age, sex, percentage having diabetes, time on dialysis, distribution of blood groups, and total serum levels of immunoglobulins A (IgA), G (IgG), and M (IgM). In patients and controls, IgG anti-Gal levels were not significantly different, but IgM anti-Gal levels were significantly lower in both PD and HD patients compared with controls. A nonsignificant trend toward lower IgM anti-Gal levels in PD patients compared with HD patients was also observed. IgG anti-Gal levels correlated positively with time on dialysis in the HD patients, but not in the PD patients. IgG anti-Gal levels also were found to be markedly elevated in three patients with chronic liver disease, but no other scrutinized variable appeared to influence IgG or IgM anti-Gal levels.","607":"CD40-CD40 ligand (CD40L) interaction plays an important role in macrophage\/monocyte-mediated inflammatory processes by up-regulating cytokine production by macrophages\/monocytes and by preventing macrophage apoptosis at the inflammation sites. The present study investigated the possible regulation of CD40L expression in peritonitis during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). We used fluorescence-activated cell sorter (FACS) analysis to detect CD40L expression on macrophages obtained from peritoneal dialysate. Our results showed that CD40L expression on macrophages was significantly increased in a peritonitis group (4.62 +\/- 6.54) as compared to a control group (0.76 +\/- 0.30, p &lt; 0.01). The CD40L-positive cells were also significantly increased during peritonitis (97.86% +\/- 1.67% in the peritonitis group as compared to 73.10% +\/- 26.94% in the control group, p &lt; 0.05). After successful treatment, the expression of CD40L was significantly reduced (3.66 +\/- 1.12 vs 1.05 +\/- 0.02, p &lt; 0.05). We conclude that functionally expressed CD40L on macrophages may take part in acute inflammatory response during peritonitis in CAPD and may play an important role in the local defense against infection in the peritoneal cavity.","608":"A new connection system for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) has been established, and its efficacy in preventing microbial contamination of the peritoneal cavity has been tested in vitro. The system consists of a Y-shaped channel formed in the bottom of a Plexiglas cup. The Luer-lock shaped ends of the Y-shaped channel are designed to host the connectors from the drainage bag, the catheter transfer set, and the bag of fresh dialysate. Because the connectors from the catheter transfer set and the fresh bag are located at the inner surface of the cup bed, and because the cup is filled with disinfectant during the entire exchange procedure, all at-risk steps are continuously protected by disinfectant (that is, removal of the caps from the connectors, connection and disconnection, replacement of the caps). Still, because the patient could inadvertently extract and contaminate one of the two connectors (although such a possibility is unlikely), the disinfecting efficacy of the system was tested in vitro. Despite contamination with various micro-organisms at the highest possible concentrations, all tests showed negative bacterial growth, thus confirming the absolute efficacy of the system in preventing exogenous transluminal peritonitis.","609":"The definition of peritoneal sclerosis encompasses a vast range of peritoneal alterations induced by peritoneal dialysis. The morphology, clinical correlations and pathophysiology of, and experimental animal models for, this condition show such striking differences from case to case as to suggest the existence of two nosological entities: simple sclerosis and sclerosing peritonitis.","610":"The role of vancomycin and other antibiotics in treatment of acute peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients is well established. However, the role of preoperative vancomycin or cephalosporins in preventing early infection in newly placed peritoneal dialysis catheters remains controversial. We performed a prospective randomized study to examine the role of vancomycin or cefazolin prophylaxis in decreasing the incidence of postoperative peritonitis. Over 8-year period, 265 patients undergoing 305 permanent peritoneal catheter placement procedures were randomized into three groups. Group I (103 procedures) received a single intravenous (i.v.) dose of 1000 mg vancomycin 12 hours before the peritoneal catheter placement procedure. Group II (102 procedures) received a single i.v. dose of 1000 mg of Ancef (cefazolin) 3 hours before the procedure. Group III (100 procedures) received no antibiotics preoperatively for a least one week before the procedure. Patients were monitored for peritonitis during the following 14 days. Peritonitis developed in 1 patient (1%) in Group I (vancomycin group) compared to 12 patients (12%) in Group III (control group), p = 0.002, and in 9 patients (9%) in Group II (cefazolin group) compared to Group III, p = 0.68. We conclude that the use of preoperative single-dose i.v. vancomycin prophylaxis for permanent peritoneal dialysis catheter placement reduces the risk of postoperative peritonitis. Cefazolin did not achieve a statistically significant difference from the control group and may not provide adequate prophylaxis.","611":"Exit-site infection (ESI) refractory to medical therapy is an important complication of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Between July 1994 and June 1998, 28 patients in our hospital underwent simultaneous removal and reinsertion of Tenckhoff catheters for the treatment of refractory ESI. The ESI was caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 22 patients (78%), methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus in 5 patients (18%), and diphtheroid bacilli in 1 patient (4%). The patients had received antibiotic treatment for a mean duration of 11.6 +\/- 5.8 weeks (range: 3-28 weeks) before their operations. During each operation, the old Tenckhoff catheter was removed and a new catheter was inserted in the opposite side of the abdomen. CAPD was resumed after two weeks of intermittent peritoneal dialysis. All patients received intravenous antibiotic cover for seven days after the operation. Early post-operative complications were uncommon. At one year after the operation, 22 patients (78%) were free of ESI. Six patients (22%) had a recurrence of ESI 21.3 +\/- 6 weeks (range: 16-32 weeks) after their operation. All new infections were treated successfully with antibiotics. Seven patients (25%) had one episode of peritonitis each, all of which resolved with intraperitoneal antibiotic treatment. We conclude that simultaneous removal and reinsertion of Tenckhoff catheters is a safe and effective method for the treatment of refractory ESI. The procedure alleviates the need for temporary hemodialysis and allows an early return to CAPD.","612":"We have developed a new telemedicine system to monitor elderly and handicapped patients that use an automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) system to perform continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) at home. The system has two parts: (1) a data collection and transport system, and (2) an interview system (\"View Send\" system). The former is assembled from the APD cycler, an automated blood-pressure recorder, and a scale. The latter is a combination of a digital camera, television, and set-top box (a kind of computer). The APD system contains recording and data transport junctions, a monitoring device, and a data tabulation function. All data collected by the APD system are sent directly in real time to the physician's office. Patients can easily use this telemedicine system to contact the medical staff at the Saitama Medical School CAPD center and to consult concerning their condition. Furthermore, the staff can directly change the CAPD schedule (dose and duration). Seven patients, including some who are older than 90 years or who are handicapped, have been using this telemedicine system for between 1 and 6 months (average: 3 months). From our recent experience, our tentative conclusions are that (1) elderly and handicapped patients benefit from this system by being able to maintain CAPD without major problems and accidents; (2) other problems are mainly due to simple mistakes such as accidentally pushing the on and off switches; (3) quality of life is improved for the patients.","613":"Therapeutic compliance and patient education are presently considered crucial parts of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) therapy. In the center where Italian home and self-care dialysis treatment started, an education program was designed as multi-step pathway--following patients from chronic renal failure to dialysis and eventual graft--employing lessons, booklets, and books. Each step was validated in various subsets of patients. Lessons involved two hours of informal discussion on the main aspects of ESRD and renal replacement therapy (RRT); booklets were created from tape recordings of the lessons. Patient participation was good, with 28 of 33 patients on charge in the center for 6 months or more taking part in more than one lesson in 1999. In 16 of 16 patients who answered a questionnaire after two lessons, expressed opinion was \"good\" to \"fair.\" All asked for further material. With regard to books, 500 copies of the book What does dialysis mean? were given out in the region; this book was validated in 22 patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and 18 on hemodialysis (HD). It helped patients to accept dialysis in 65% of cases and to comprehend it in 90%. Four thousand copies of the book Stories, containing 18 interviews on transplantation, were printed, and this book was validated in 21 patients on self-care and 35 on hospital dialysis (potential candidates for graft). Of 56 patients, 53 asked for further material; 19 changed their initial opinion (10 choose transplantation, despite initial skepticism; 9 put off transplantation, despite initial acceptance). On a local scale, the program led 12 of 18 new patients, who followed at least part of the program, to choose self-dialysis (PD, home, and self-care dialysis).","614":"In August 1999, an earthquake of magnitude 7.8 on the Richter scale hit northwestern Turkey. The epicenter was in Izmit, an industrial town about 60 km from Istanbul. This paper presents data about the fate of CAPD patients who were living in that region at the time of the earthquake. A total of 42 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients (14 females, 28 males; 37 adult patients, 5 pediatric patients) were permanent residents of the earthquake region. They were followed in the CAPD units of Marmara University Hospital (n = 6), Gata Military Hospital (n = 2), and Goztepe SSK Hospital (n = 10, including the 5 pediatric patients) in Istanbul, and in Uludag University Hospital in Bursa (n = 6) and Kocaeli University Hospital in Izmit (n = 18). Two CAPD patients, together with their families, died under the rubble in the city of Golcuk. One CAPD nurse from Kocaeli University Hospital in Izmit also died a victim of the earthquake. One patient who lived in Golcuk was under the rubble for 3 hours; she was rescued with no crush injuries and was able to continue with CAPD 24 hours after her rescue. Eight patients reported that their homes were completely destroyed during the earthquake, while nine patients reported serious damage to their houses. Ten patients had to move to other towns to live with relatives because their homes were no longer suitable for habitation, and twelve patients had to stay permanently in tents provided by the Red Cross. All of the patients were able to continue their CAPD therapy and had no interruption in the supply of their CAPD solutions. Four patients on continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) therapy continued to use their HomeChoice machines (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, IL, U.S.A.) even while living in a tent. CAPD patients from the Kocaeli University Hospital had to be temporarily referred to other CAPD centers in Istanbul and Bursa because the Kocaeli University Hospital was seriously damaged in the earthquake. We expect that these major changes in quality of life circumstances will have an important impact on the morbidity of these patients, especially in regard to the rate of peritonitis and the adequacy of dialysis.","615":"A prospective study was planned to follow the clinical and laboratory data of hemodialysis (HD) patients after change of treatment to continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Patients who had been on the HD program for more than 6 months were selected and followed for at least 6 months under CAPD treatment. Measured parameters included hemoglobin, ferritin, C-reactive protein (CRP), calcium, phosphorus, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) levels; lipid profile; total protein and albumin; body mass index and triceps skin fold thickness; echocardiographic findings; and medications administered. We followed 34 patients (12 males, 22 females; mean age: 43.5 +\/- 14.5 years; mean HD duration: 36.6 +\/- 24.76 months) for a mean period of 19.8 +\/- 11.9 months after change of treatment to CAPD. We saw a significant increase in mean hemoglobin, cholesterol, triglyceride, high-density lipoprotein (HDL), lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)], phosphorus, and iPTH levels. We observed a decrease in erythropoietin dose, mean ferritin levels, systolic blood pressure (139.4 +\/- 22.8 mmHg vs 114.4 +\/- 21.0 mmHg, p = 0.001), diastolic blood pressure (85.7 +\/- 12.6 mmHg vs 73.5 +\/- 17.6 mmHg, p = 0.002), percentage of left ventricular hypertrophy, systolic and diastolic dysfunction, and the number of hypertensive drugs received. A significant improvement in the nutritional status of the patients (total protein, body mass index and triceps skin fold thickness) was also seen. In conclusion, CAPD treatment has a short-term outcome superior to that of HD in terms of better nutritional status and better control of hypertension and anemia.","616":"Icodextrins (Icos) produce constant linear ultrafiltration (UF). This effect allows Icos to replace glucose during long dwells in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis [CAPD (nighttime)] and automated peritoneal dialysis [APD (daytime)]. However, the effectiveness of Icos in producing UF (IcoUF) is limited by lymphatic reabsorption, whose extent depends partly on posture and physical activity. This paper aims to assess whether the difference in posture and physical activity between daytime dwells in APD and nighttime dwells in CAPD affects IcoUF. Patients undergoing first treatment were retrospectively examined. Ten patients were on CAPD [4 males, 6 females; average age, 73.0 +\/- 13.4 years; body surface area (BSA), 1.63 +\/- 0.21 m2; total volume per day, 5.6 +\/- 1.9 L], and ten were on APD (7 males, 3 females; average age, 67.7 +\/- 9.8; BSA, 1.75 +\/- 0.22 m2; total volume per night, 10.5 +\/- 0.9 L). Ultrafiltration was assessed for seven consecutive days preceding a peritoneal equilibration test (PET) and collection of diuresis. In both groups, 3 patients had no diuresis, and the difference between CAPD and APD was not significant (625 +\/- 762 mL vs 780 +\/- 878 mL). Moreover, no significant difference was seen in 4-hour dialysate-to-plasma creatinine (D\/P) between CAPD (0.65 +\/- 0.12) and APD (0.64 +\/- 0.05). Dwell times with Icos were shorter in CAPD than in APD (11.5 +\/- 1.8 hours vs 14.8 +\/- 0.5 hours, p &lt; 0.0005), but the fill volume was not significantly different (1760 +\/- 286 mL vs 1790 +\/- 249 mL). Water excretion owing to diuresis and dialysis [total water excretion (TWE): 1619 +\/- 497 mL CAPD vs 1762 +\/- 736 mL APD] and dialytic UF (363 +\/- 443 mL CAPD vs 748 +\/- 479 mL APD), which is not linked to Icos, were not significantly different between the two groups. The IcoUF and the percentage of IcoUF to TWE were significantly higher in CAPD compared to APD [631 +\/- 253 mL (44% +\/- 27%) vs 234 +\/- 215 mL (19% +\/- 19%), p &lt; 0.001 (p &lt; 0.05)]. In conclusion, an upright posture and physical activity seem to produce less IcoUF in APD despite the longer dwell. These factors could, indeed, produce greater intraperitoneal pressure, resulting in increased lymphatic reabsorption during a daytime dwell.","617":"Chronic renal failure is an unusual complication of hereditary clotting disorders (HCDs), but this situation could change in the near future. The modality of dialysis for end-stage renal disease (ESRD) in patients with an HCD is a difficult choice. Hemodialysis (HD) may be considered, but intensive treatment with coagulation factors is required for vascular access execution and for each HD procedure. Peritoneal dialysis (PD) has been infrequently proposed. However, PD requires coagulation replacement therapy only during peritoneal catheter placement. The aim of this paper is to describe our experience of three patients with ESRD and HCD, successfully treated with chronic PD in the medium term. Case 1 was a 58-year-old man with moderate hemophilia A, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. His ESRD was secondary to glomerulonephritis. A double-cuff peritoneal catheter was surgically placed with pre-emptive factor VIII administration. He began treatment with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). An inguinal hernia was repaired without complications. After eleven months of follow-up, no hemorrhage episodes have been observed and clinical outcome is optimal. Case 2 was a 46-year-old man with severe hemophilia A, type 2 diabetes mellitus, and HCV and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections. He developed a diabetic nephropathy that required renal replacement therapy. A permanent silicone catheter was inserted in the left internal jugular vein, and the patient started HD treatment. Later on, PD therapy was proposed. A peritoneal catheter was implanted with simultaneous factor VIII infusion. Minimal bleeding was observed at the subcutaneous tunnel over the following 48 hours. The patient started PD treatment without complications, and two months later, remaining asymptomatic, transferred to another center. Case 3 was a 41-year-old woman diagnosed with von Willebrand disease type 2A, HCV infection, and polycystic kidney disease, who presented with ESRD. An internal arteriovenous fistula was performed under coagulation factor cover. During a fistulography, and despite coagulation factor substitutive treatment, the patient showed an important hematoma. Afterwards, PD was considered. A peritoneal catheter was implanted under coagulation factor cover. The postoperative course was uncomplicated, and the patient started CAPD treatment. During follow up, she suffered two hemoperitoneum episodes that were resolved with cold dialysate. After nine months, she uneventfully continued on PD. In conclusion, PD is the therapy of choice for patients with hereditary clotting disorders and ESRD requiring dialysis. Peritoneal dialysis therapy avoids many of the complications related to HD therapy.","618":"In our center, a total of 451 peritoneal dialysis catheters were implanted in 424 uremic patients from 1986 to 1999. All catheters were implanted by the percutaneous method of Di Paolo. From 1986 to May 1997 (period A), we inserted 389 catheters using the Weston-Roberts catheter armed with a metallic sharp mandrel for the first access to the peritoneal cavity. After May 1997 (period B), we implanted 62 peritoneal dialysis catheters, replacing the metallic sharp mandrel with the Veress needle to arm the Weston-Roberts catheter. The aim of this retrospective study was to determine the incidence of early complications (within 2 weeks) and to compare the incidence between the two groups (period A versus period B). The results suggest that the incidence of perforation of abdominal organs is lower, but not significantly so, when the Veress needle is used.","619":"Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) uses a cycler to perform dialysis exchanges and requires the patient to respond to an audible alarm signifying an interruption in the therapy. Consequently, an unassisted hearing-impaired patient could not use the system. By converting the standard alarm to a vibrating signal, the cycler was successfully adapted to accommodate the special needs of our hearing-impaired patient. The items required for the modification were the Sonic Alert Wake Up Alarm (Model SA-WA300: Sonic Alert, Troy, MI, U.S.A.) and the Sonic Alert Super Shaker Bed Vibrator (Model SA-SS120V: Sonic Alert). The patient can place the vibrator under either the pillow or the mattress. When the cycler alarm is activated, vibration wakens the patient. The equipment was purchased from Harris Communications (Eden Prairie, MN, U.S.A.) through a referral by the Easter Seal Society. Three days were needed to complete training compared to an average of one or two days for patients previously trained for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The patient remained on cycler therapy for approximately four months when the unrelated development of an abdominal hernia required termination of peritoneal dialysis and subsequent transfer to hemodialysis. In conclusion, a modified cycler can provide a safe and efficient renal replacement therapy option for a hearing-impaired patient.","620":"Our experience and the research literature suggest that sleep pattern disturbance (SPD) is a problem among dialysis patients. The purpose of this study was to describe the scope of sleep problems among willing patients on peritoneal dialysis at a mid-size university teaching hospital. To examine SPD, this descriptive study used a sleep diary that patients completed each morning for a week. Patients were asked to describe sleep latency, perceived difficulty falling asleep, number of arousals, use of sedatives, whether they awoke feeling rested, sleep efficiency, and factors preventing or inducing sleep. The sample consisted of 22 respondents whose average age was 60.5 years. With respect to the variables included in the sleep diary, respondents reported: 82% sleep latency of 40 minutes or less; of 154 nights studied, difficulty falling asleep on 41 (27%) of the nights; 82% experience of 15 or fewer sleep arousals per week (that is, approximately 2 arousals per night); 64% no use of sedatives during the week; 55% experience of feeling rested on awakening 5 or more mornings per week; and 55% experience of sleep efficiency above 80%. Of the factors reported to interfere with sleep, treatment-related factors such as alarms and other machine-related problems were, by far, the most predominant, reported by 82% of respondents. These findings compare very favorably with reports in the literature noting the incidence of SPD among dialysis patients to be as high as 73%. Information regarding factors that are barriers or facilitators to sleep have formed the basis of some practice changes within our program to address this distressing problem.","621":"Cardiovascular disease is the leading cause of death in patients with end-stage renal disease. In addition, abnormalities of coagulation and fibrinolysis have been reported in patients with uremia. However, whether these hemostatic abnormalities lead to cardiovascular disease in dialysis patients is currently unknown. Therefore, we investigated the association of hemostatic factors with ischemic heart disease (IHD) in patients on peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. The study patients comprised 30 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients and 18 hemodialysis patients. Twenty healthy subjects served as controls. We evaluated each subject's hemostatic factors, including factor VII, factor XII, thrombin-antithrombin III complex (TAT), fibrinogen, plasmin-antiplasmin complex (PIC), plasminogen activator inhibitor (PAI-1), and D-dimer. In dialysis patients, IHD was diagnosed by documented myocardial infarction or positive result on coronary angiogram or by positive thallium myocardial scintigraphy. Factor VII, fibrinogen, PIC, and D-dimer levels were significantly higher in the two dialysis groups than in controls. All hemostatic variables were similar between the two dialysis groups. Subject age (p = 0.005), PIC (p = 0.005), and D-dimer level (p = 0.003) were significantly higher in patients with IHD than in patients without IHD in the dialysis groups. Multiple logistic regression analysis showed that only patient age and D-dimer levels were independent predictors of IHD. Adjusted odds ratio for IHD was 1.06 for each 10 ng\/mL increase of D-dimer (p = 0.06). In CAPD patients, only D-dimer was independently associated with IHD (odds ratio: 1.06, p = 0.03). We conclude that multiple hemostatic abnormalities are present in dialysis patients and that elevated D-dimer levels are independently associated with prevalent IHD.","622":"The variations in peritoneal equilibration test (PET) characteristics in various ethnic groups have been reported. Data are scarce regarding the pattern of membrane characteristics in Indian patients. The factors affecting PET and the PET, in turn, affecting patient outcome are controversial issues. We prospectively analyzed 41 patients to evaluate: (1) the pattern of PET characteristics in Indian patients; (2) the factors affecting the PET; (3) the effect of membrane characteristics on patient outcome. The mean period of follow up was 17.1 +\/- 9.3 months. The PET results revealed 21 high transporters (51%), 13 high-average transporters (32%), 6 low-average transporters (15%), and 1 low transporter (2%). The distribution of the various PET categories in patients below the age of 60 years and those 60 years or above was not significant (p = 0.70). The sex distribution (p = 0.94) and prevalence of diabetes (p = 0.62) were not significantly different in various PET categories. On regression analysis, PET values were not affected by the age of patients (beta = 0.80, p = 0.61). Patient survival among high and high-average transporters was significantly less compared with low and low-average transporters (p = 0.01). We conclude that Indian patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) have a higher proportion of high and high-average transporters. The pattern of membrane kinetics cannot be explained by differences in patient characteristics and diabetic status. Patients with high PET values have poorer patient survival on CAPD.","623":"Peritoneal clearance has not yet been proven to predict clinical outcome in peritoneal dialysis patients independent of residual renal function. Studies looking at the relationship between clearance and outcome have not been adequately powered to detect an effect. Pending better studies, clearance targets have been established, and higher clearances are being delivered. This article reviews existing literature on the topic and discusses the problems associated with carrying out a randomized controlled trial to address the issue.","624":"\"Weight-height\" indices including percent of ideal weight (%IW) and body mass index (BMI) are used to estimate degree of obesity in populations and are predictors of survival in dialysis patients. Amputation affects the relationship between weight and height independently of the degree of obesity. Corrections of both %IW and BMI for amputation have been published, but a National (U.S.) computer nutrition program used in the authors' institution uses only the correction for %IW. This study had two parts: (1) To test whether the weight-height cut-off values for weight deficit (%IW 90%, BMI 20 kg\/m2) and obesity (%IW 120%, BMI 30 kg\/m2) are compatible, we performed linear regression of BMI on %IW in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients without amputations. In 349 men, BMI = 0.834 + 0.226 (%IW), r = 0.979. From this regression, the 95% confidence interval (CI) of BMI is 19.2-23.1 kg\/m2 if %IW is 90%, and 26.1-29.9 kg\/m2 if %IW is 120%. In 260 women, BMI = 2.194 + 0.184 (%IW), r = 0.974. From this regression, the 95% CI of BMI is 15.7-21.8 kg\/m2 if %IW is 90%, and 21.3-27.3 kg\/m2 if %IW is 120%. (2) To identify the direction and magnitude of the error of uncorrected BMI (BMIu) in dialysis patients with amputations, we analyzed weight-height indices in two groups of men by the computer nutrition program, which corrects %IW, but not BMI for amputation, and by the corrected BMI (BMIc) formula. In group A (amputation without height loss, n = 11), %IW = 110.2% +\/- 16.9%, BMIu = 23.6 +\/- 2.7 kg\/m2, BMIc = 26.4 +\/- 3.8 kg\/m2 (p &lt; 0.001, BMIc vs BMIu), and 5 of the 11 BMIu values fell below the 95% confidence band of the regression of BMI on %IW in patients without amputations. In group B (amputation with loss of height, n = 6), %IW = 92.7% +\/- 19.9%, BMIu = 33.9 +\/- 10.7 kg\/m2, BMIc = 22.1 +\/- 4.4 kg\/m2 (p &lt; 0.005, BMIc vs BMIu), and 5 of the 6 BMIu values fell above the 95% confidence band of the regression of BMI on %IW in patients without amputations. (1) The weight deficit cut-offs for %IW and BMI are compatible in non amputated men and women. (2) The obesity cut-offs for %IW and BMI are compatible in non amputated men, but not in non amputated women. (3) Amputation without height loss decreases BMIu, while amputation with height loss increases, in general, BMIu. (4) BMI should be corrected in PD patients with amputations. ","625":"In 1996, we raised our peritoneal dialysis (PD) dose to meet new DOQI adequacy targets. Concurrently, we noted an increase in the frequency of K+ levels below 3.5 mEq\/L. A continuous quality improvement (CQI) project was initiated to quantify the impact of increasing dialysis dose on the prevalence of hypokalemia in our unit. Measurements of serum K+, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, residual renal function, and the number and type of clinical interventions required to maintain eukalemia were abstracted from the charts of 62 patients enrolled in our program for more than 6 months and having more than two adequacy data points. In the seven consecutive 6-month periods from January 1996 to June 1999, dialysis dose progressively increased while median serum K+ decreased, and the percentage of patients requiring either diet counselling or K+ supplementation rose from 9% to 42%. We conclude that the increased clearance of K+ that occurs with increasing dialysis dose may lead to significant hypokalemia in a large proportion of PD patients dialyzed to DOQI adequacy targets. Maintenance of eukalemia in this population often requires increased K+ intake and or oral supplementation. Further studies are needed to ascertain whether the prevalence of hypokalemia is sufficient to warrant routine addition of K+ to PD dialysis solutions.","626":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) are both common forms of dialysis for patients with end-stage renal disease. A few case reports have suggested that cough is associated with PD. From 1991 to 1998, 17 patients being treated with PD at the Toronto Western Hospital demonstrated persistent cough severe enough for referral to a respirologist. Causes of cough, often more than one cause per patient, included asthma, post-nasal drip, gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD), chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, allergic rhinitis, pleural effusion, and respiratory infection. The aim of this cross-sectional study was to establish the prevalence of cough among PD patients, to determine if PD patients more commonly have a dry persistent cough than do HD patients, and, if the latter case is true, the possible reasons for it. A detailed survey of 92 PD patients and 91 HD patients was conducted in 1998 and 1999 at the University Health Network. Survey questions inquired about patient respiratory symptoms since onset of dialysis. Charts were reviewed to obtain information on use of medications possibly relevant to cough. In the PD and HD groups, 52% and 23% were females (p = 0.001), and the mean ages were 59.1 and 60.1 years, respectively. Angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitors had been taken by 65% (PD) and 55% (HD) of patients, and beta-blocking medications by 43% (PD) and 51% (HD). Since initiation of dialysis--mean 2.7 years (PD) and 3.7 years (HD)--22% of PD patients reported persistent cough versus 7% of HD patients (p = 0.003). Although no significant association was seen between cough and self-reported heartburn in HD patients (p = 0.439), a significant association between cough and self-reported heartburn was seen in PD patients: 67% of PD patients with persistent cough reported heartburn versus 29% of those without cough (p = 0.008). The findings suggest that GERD and associated cough are more common in PD patients than in HD patients, perhaps owing to increases in intra-abdominal pressure from the peritoneal dialysate.","627":"We performed a retrospective analysis of our institution's experience with the technique of delayed externalization of subcutaneously tunnelled peritoneal dialysis catheters. From 1993 to 1999, 49 catheters were implanted in 37 patients. Median age of the patients was 43.6 years; 70% were female; 32% had diabetes. Most of the catheters were midline, single-cuff, curled Quinton catheters without a swan neck. One patient underwent transplantation prior to catheter externalization. One catheter leaked prior to externalization and was removed. The remaining catheters were externalized a median of 40 days (range: 18-319 days) post implantation. At externalization, two leaks and one omental obstruction occurred, causing primary catheter failure. Total days of catheter follow-up were 17,895. One-year and two-year catheter survival rates were 70% and 40% respectively. Catheter failure occurred owing to infection in 7 cases and to mechanical complications in 10 cases. The rate of exit-site infection was 1 per 9.9 patient-months, and of peritonitis, 1 per 16.2 patient-months. Including primary failures, mechanical complications were 12 hernias, 6 leaks, and 4 instances of malposition. We conclude that delayed externalization of single-cuff catheters without a swan neck is associated with increased mechanical and infectious complications. These findings may warrant a change to a double-cuff catheter with a swan neck.","628":"The impact of serum albumin at start of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (SA1), serum albumin before death (SA2), and change in serum albumin during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (delta SA) were prospectively studied in 41 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients with a follow-up of 19 +\/- 11.6 months. For analysis, patients were divided into two groups at each measurement point: SA1 or SA2 &gt; 3.0 g\/dL or delta SA &lt; 1.0 g\/dL (group I), and SA1 or SA2 &lt; 3.0 g\/dL or delta SA &gt; 1.0 g\/dL (group II). On log rank test, the mortality rate was significantly higher in group II patients in relation to SA1 (p &lt; or = 0.0001), SA2 (p = 0.0002), and delta SA (p = 0.001). On univariate Cox proportional hazard regression analysis, SA1 (p = 0.0001), SA2 (p = 0.0001), delta SA (p = 0.002), and episodes of peritonitis (p = 0.0001) were significant. On multivariate analysis, SA2 (p = 0.003) was significantly related to patient mortality. SA2 (r = 0.8; p = 0.0001), but not delta SA, was related to SA1. We conclude that SA2 is the best predictor of patient mortality on CAPD. SA2 is strongly related to SA1. Thus protein restriction in the pre-dialysis stage should be advised cautiously to avoid consequent hypoalbuminemia.","629":"Polyglucose dialysis solution (PG-DS) decreases serum amylase activity owing to interference in the analytical method. The interference can make it difficult to diagnose pancreatitis. Our aim was to check whether, during PG-DS administration, serum lipase activity changes simultaneously with serum amylase activity, and, if so, what the reason is for the detected change. Studies were started in 14 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients in whom 7.5% PG-DS was applied for the overnight exchange. In addition to standard clinical and laboratory data, serum activity of lipase and of total amylase were evaluated at 1.6 +\/- 0.8 months before PG-DS introduction (period I, n = 14), after 1.2 +\/- 0.6 months of PG-DS administration (period II, n = 14), after 4.4 +\/- 0.8 months of PG-DS administration (period III, n = 11), after 8.8 +\/- 2.2 months of PG-DS administration (period IV, n = 9), and at 2.0 +\/- 0.6 months after PG-DS discontinuation (period V, n = 11). The PG-DS was also added to serum from CAPD patients with known activity of amylase and of lipase. Immediately and 3 hours after PG-DS addition, a significant decrease in total amylase activity was seen; lipase activity was unchanged. In consecutive study periods, the results (median and range) were: for lipase activity--50 U\/L (12-131 U\/L), 59 U\/L (25-160 U\/L; p &lt; 0.05 vs period I), 73 U\/L (26-158 U\/L; p &lt; 0.05 vs period I), 66 U\/L (30-203 U\/L; p &lt; 0.05 vs period I), and 44 U\/L (15-112 U\/L); for amylase activity--81 U\/L (43-249 U\/L), 14 U\/L (5-82 U\/L; p &lt; 0.05 vs period I and period V), 15 U\/L (5-192 U\/L; p &lt; 0.05 vs period I), 15 U\/L (10-93 U\/L; p &lt; 0.05 vs period I and period V), and 118 U\/L (4-221 U\/L). An increase in serum lipase activity over the normal range (27-65 U\/L) was not accompanied by clinical symptoms of pancreatic dysfunction, but rises were simultaneously shown in blood urea nitrogen, in serum level of creatinine and of total calcium, and in calcium phosphorus product. Our results confirm PG-DS influence on amylase determinations, exclude PG-DS interference in lipase measurements, and indicate that long-term PG-DS administration influences pancreatic exocrine function at a subclinical level.","630":"The Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) guidelines recommend that, for patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), a weekly creatinine clearance (WCC) of at least 60 L\/1.73 m2 is needed for adequate dialysis. As residual renal function (RRF) declines, maintaining these target levels may become difficult. Over time, declines in ultrafiltration (UF) caused by increases in peritoneal permeability, in conjunction with decreases in RRF, may limit continuation of CAPD therapy. In an effort to achieve adequate solute clearance and ultrafiltration in several CAPD patients at our center who have declining RRF or poor UF, we use combined peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis (PD + HD) as a therapeutic strategy when individualization of peritoneal dialysis is unsuccessful. At our center, PD + HD consists of five days of PD therapy followed by one HD session per week on Saturday. After the weekly HD session, patients are liberated from bag exchanges until Sunday evening. This PD + HD therapy was used in six cases where poor solute clearance and water retention were refractory to PD therapy alone. The combined therapy was well tolerated, and symptoms related to uremia improved in all six cases. Additionally, improvements in quality of life (QOL) were documented in all patients who were managed with the combined therapy. The improvements in QOL may have resulted from decreases in uremic symptomatology or freedom from bag exchanges. The PD + HD therapy can best be applied in the uremic PD patient without residual renal function whose peritoneal membrane is not deteriorated. The therapy allows for the continuation of PD without shifting to total HD in PD patients who continue to have uremic symptoms even after individualization of the PD prescription. Our patients readily accepted combined therapy, and we have noted excellent compliance with this therapy at our center.","631":"This study investigated the incidence of subclinical abdominal hernia in patients starting peritoneal dialysis (PD). From April 1995 to August 1999, every new patient without clinical evidence of abdominal leakage underwent peritoneal scintigraphy. A total of 59 patients were enrolled in the study. Imaging of the peritoneal cavity was performed by mixing 74 MBq (2 mCi) of 99 m technetium sulfur colloid with 2 L of 1.36% dextrose peritoneal dialysis solution. Sequential gamma camera static images were obtained at 0 minutes, 60 minutes, and after drainage. Ten abdominal hernias (2 diaphragmatic leaks, 8 inguinal hernias) were observed in ten patients (6 males, 4 females; mean age: 65.1 years). One patient with diaphragmatic leak recovered partial renal function and stopped continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD); the other was switched to automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). Among the eight patients with inguinal hernia, six had no clinical manifestations within eight months of follow-up. Two patients became symptomatic at 15 months and 25 months respectively. They underwent surgical repair. In CAPD patients without obvious abdominal hernias, peritoneal scintigraphy at onset of dialysis discovered 17% positive cases. The technique of scintigraphy is safe, with a low radiation exposure. Surgical repair for maintenance on CAPD is not always necessary, and a change in the PD strategy may be useful.","632":"As CAPD patients lose residual renal function, adequate dialysis is frequently impossible to obtain unless the dialysis prescription is changed. For patients already on cycler therapy with a \"wet\" day, we compared the advantage of adding one hour on the cycler to adding an extra, midday exchange. To compare the two approaches, we used a commercial computer program to optimize solute clearance in 90 patients. Adding one hour of cycler therapy increases Kt\/V and creatinine clearance (CrCl) by approximately 6.4%-8%. When a midday exchange is added, the increase in Kt\/V and CrCl varies between 17.5% and 21.6%. We conclude that adding an extra, midday exchange always gives a better increase in weekly Kt\/V and CrCl than that obtained by adding an extra hour of cycler therapy.","633":"Introduction of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) induces a variety of hemodynamic changes in patients with end-stage renal failure. Among them, blood pressure (BP) control is likely to be the most important in determining long-term survival. The aim of our study was to use 24-hour ambulatory blood pressure monitoring (24 ABPM) to evaluate the previous and present BP status of patients on CAPD. We studied 18 non diabetic hypertensive patients who were introduced onto CAPD. At least 3-6 months before the introduction of CAPD, recordings of 24 ABPM were obtained. These recordings were then compared to others obtained 2-3 months after the introduction of CAPD. The average BP was higher before CAPD than after (160\/91 +\/- 10\/5 mmHg vs 154\/88 +\/- 6\/3 mmHg, p &lt; 0.01). In addition, the doses and number of antihypertensive drugs used by the patients were reduced. Analysis of 24 ABPM revealed BP reduction predominantly in the daytime and less in the nighttime after introduction of CAPD. These results indicate that introduction of CAPD cannot reduce susceptibility of cardiovascular events, because nocturnal elevation of BP remains unchanged. We are therefore reminded that, after introduction of CAPD, casual BP measurements confined to the daytime may underestimate cardiovascular risk.","634":"Chronic renal failure can be considered an immunosuppressed state. One immunologic function that may be compromised is tumor surveillance. Studies have suggested an incidence of cancer that is greater in dialysis patients that in the age- and sex-matched non dialysis population. A drawback to many previous studies is \"ascertainment bias,\" wherein closely monitored populations have a higher rate of cancer detection. However, allowing for systematic bias, a true increase in neoplasia appears to exist in dialysis patients. While many agencies have established protocols for cancer screening in the general population, little has been written about recommendations for cancer screening in dialysis patients. Moreover, the high mortality from cardiovascular disease may render cancer screening protocols redundant and cost-ineffective. This article offers recommendations that emphasize that risk profile of individual patients rather than a population-based approach to cancer screening.","635":"The use of erythropoietin in dialysis patients is associated with improved quality of life and may lead to improved outcomes. Peritoneal dialysis patients are generally taught to give subcutaneous erythropoietin at home. The purpose of this study was to determine compliance with erythropoietin use in peritoneal dialysis patients. Records of patient prescriptions, refills of erythropoietin, the person administering the injection, and average hematocrit were retrospectively examined. Demographic and comorbidity data were collected prospectively on all peritoneal dialysis patients. The use of more than 90% of the prescribed dose was considered compliant. Data were available for 55 patients. The mean follow-up time was 12 months. Thirty patients (55%) were noncompliant with erythropoietin. Compliant patients were older (65.4 years vs 50 years, p = 0.01), had higher comorbidity (p = 0.01), higher average hematocrit (34% vs 31.5%, p &lt; 0.003) and were less likely to self-administer the injection. Sex, diabetes, and compliance with dialysis exchanges were not associated with erythropoietin compliance. Using logistic regression, the only significant variable was the person administering the erythropoietin (r = 0.46, p = 0.005). Noncompliance with subcutaneous erythropoietin is a significant problem. Compliance may improve if someone other than the patient is trained to administer it.","636":"Some patients on long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) develop a hyperpermeability state, owing to peritoneal neoangiogenesis. Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF), a potent mitogen for endothelial cells, has been implicated in most diseases characterized by microvascular neoformation. Erythropoietin (EPO) is able to induce endothelial proliferation in vitro. Our aim was to elucidate whether VEGF serum levels are influenced by EPO treatment, and whether VEGF serum level maintains a relationship with peritoneal transport data. We analyzed serum levels of VEGF in 35 PD patients (18 males, 17 females). Mean age was 58 years, with a mean time on PD of 98 +\/- 75 months. Of the 35 patients, 19 were on automated peritoneal dialysis, and 16 were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. Seven patients had diabetes. Peritoneal transport parameters were: urea mass transfer coefficient (MTC), 19.5 +\/- 6.6 mL\/min; creatinine MTC, 9.9 +\/- 4.7 mL\/min; net ultrafiltration, 491 +\/- 166 mL per 4-hour dwell. Twenty seven patients were under therapy with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). Mean serum VEGF levels were 347 +\/- 203 pg\/mL (range 66-857 pg\/mL), with most patients in the normal range (60-700 pg\/mL). VEGF levels did not correlate with age, sex, primary renal disease, diabetes, type of PD, time on PD, peritonitis, and cumulative glucose load. We found no correlation with urea MTC, creatinine MTC, ultrafiltration rate, or protein effluent levels. However, a significant negative correlation with residual renal function was seen (r = -0.39, p &lt; 0.05). Patients treated with rHuEPO showed significantly higher serum levels of VEGF than non treated patients (375 +\/- 220 pg\/mL vs 251 +\/- 75 pg\/mL, p &lt; 0.05), although they had similar residual renal function. We conclude that increased serum VEGF levels are associated with EPO treatment. Consequently, VEGF might have a role in the EPO effects found in PD patients. Whether both agents are related to peritoneal neoangiogenesis requires further research.","637":"The efficacy of intermittent, small doses of intravenous iron in hemodialysis patients is well established. But poor peripheral vascular access and frequency of therapy preclude acceptability of this method in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Therefore, despite its marginal efficacy, oral iron remains the common method of iron supplementation in these patients. This prospective, cross-over trial compares infusion of total dose iron (ITDI) and oral iron supplementation in outpatient PD patients. Eleven stable CAPD patients with an hematocrit (Hct) of less than 33%, or a transferrin saturation (TSAT) of less than 30%, or both, were entered into the study. The study design included an oral phase [4 months, ferrous sulfate 325 mg (195 mg elemental iron), three times daily], a \"wash-out\" phase (1 month, no iron supplementation), and an ITDI phase [4 months, single infusion over 4 hours of 1 g iron dextran mixed in 1\/2 normal saline]. Laboratory parameters were monitored monthly, and subcutaneous recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) doses were adjusted monthly to maintain a hematocrit above 33%. Patients with hyperparathyroidism, aluminum toxicity, and weekly Kt\/V below 1.8 were excluded. Nine patients [8 Caucasians, 1 African American; causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD): hypertension (4 cases), diabetes (3 cases), glomerulonephritis (1 case), and polycystic kidney disease (1 case); mean age: 43.3 +\/- 2 years; mean weight: 73.0 +\/- 4 kg; duration of ESRD: 28 +\/- 13 months] completed the 9-month study. During the oral phase, TSAT rapidly decreased and a higher dose of rHuEPO failed to maintain Hct, a pattern sustained during the \"wash-out\" phase. During the ITDI phase, TSAT significantly increased and improvement in Hct resulted in a significant lowering of rHuEPO doses. The ITDI therapy was well tolerated. We conclude that ITDI is the preferred method of iron supplementation in outpatient PD patients.","638":"Owing to the lack of data dealing with the influence of polyglucose dialysis solution (PG-DS) on serum indicators of iron status, our study aimed at examining this problem in patients receiving PG-DS for the overnight exchange during treatment with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. We evaluated serum concentrations of iron, ferritin, and transferrin, total iron binding capacity (TIBC), and transferrin saturation (TSAT) at 1.6 +\/- 0.8 months before introducing 7.5% PG-DS for an overnight 2 L exchange lasting about 10 hours (period I, n = 14), after 1.2 +\/- 0.6 months of PG-DS administration (period II, n = 14), after 4.4 +\/- 0.8 months of PG-DS administration (period III, n = 11), after 8.8 +\/- 2.2 months of PG-DS administration (period IV, n = 9), and at 2.0 +\/- 0.6 months after PG-DS discontinuation (period V, n = 11). Interference owing to PG-DS in laboratory determinations of serum iron parameters was excluded. Indices of nutritional status were also evaluated in all study periods. Significant differences in iron parameters were seen between periods I and III, or I and IV for transferrin (212 +\/- 41 mg\/dL vs 253 +\/- 36 mg\/dL), TIBC (304 +\/- 40 micrograms\/dL vs 338 +\/- 31 micrograms\/dL) and TSAT (34% +\/- 15% vs 24% +\/- 4%). After PG-DS withdrawal, these parameters all returned to pre-treatment values. Improvement in nutritional status was indicated by increases in total body mass (73.9 +\/- 15.6 kg vs 77.4 +\/- 13.8 kg), lean body mass (54.5 +\/- 9.7 kg vs 56.9 +\/- 8.5 kg), and serum total protein concentration (61.7 +\/- 10.8 g\/L vs 70.5 +\/- 8.0 g\/L). We conclude that serum transferrin concentration increases during PG-DS administration without enhanced iron binding to transferrin. An increase in transferrin level can be related to improved nutritional status.","639":"End-stage renal disease remains the primary indication for the use of peritoneal dialysis. The therapy, however, has been used for the treatment of various other clinical conditions. Evidence has accumulated to support the use of peritoneal dialysis to maintain euvolemia, to improve functional status, and to reduce hospitalizations in patients with intractable chronic congestive heart failure. The use of peritoneal dialysis as a modality for core rewarming in patients with severe hypothermia has been established; in selected circumstances, it is probably the therapy of choice. The field of oncology has borrowed heavily from the technique of peritoneal dialysis for administering intraperitoneal chemotherapy; even though the therapy remains largely experimental today, it has great future potential. While efficacious in the treatment of acute, diuretic-resistant volume overload in patients with congestive heart failure and in patients with severe, disabling psoriasis, the introduction of alternative methods of management have rendered the use of peritoneal dialysis obsolete. Finally, the role of peritoneal lavage in the management of patients with pancreatitis remains controversial and is no longer routinely used.","640":"Only a small number of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients with diabetes have been followed for more than 5 years. Lack of extended follow-up for these patients is largely due to coexisting, far-advanced damage to target organs at initiation of dialysis, with progression of that damage during the course of dialysis; the presence of various comorbid conditions at the start of dialysis; and limits to long-term PD technique. Among renal replacement modalities, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) has been favored by many clinicians for the treatment of diabetic patients owing to reasons inherent in the therapy. Reported survival rates of diabetic patients on CAPD vary from 17%-72% for the fourth year (mean value: 39%) and from 19%-63% for the fifth year (mean value: 35%). Diabetic patients have actuarial rates of patient survival and technique survival that are lower than those for non diabetic patients of comparable age on CAPD. Patient survival for diabetic patients undergoing PD is similar to that for diabetic patients on hemodialysis. Because the peritoneal membrane maintains its ability to adequately purify blood for a long time, CAPD remains a viable form of long-term renal replacement therapy for diabetic patients with end-stage renal disease.","641":"Multiple regression models serve the same function as careful and thoughtful evaluation of tabular data. Two examples are given that show the value of holding one factor constant while examining the effect of another factor on an outcome of interest.","642":"The chronic peritoneal dialysis model is important for understanding the pathophysiology of peritoneal transport and for studying biocompatibility of peritoneal dialysis solutions. In this study, we compared three different chronic peritoneal dialysis models. A peritoneal catheter was placed in 23 male Sprague-Dawley rats, 12 of which had an intact omentum (model 1) and 11 of which received an omentectomy (model 2). Seven other rats, without a catheter, received a daily intraperitoneal injection (model 3). Each rat received a daily infusion of 25 mL of 3.86% glucose dialysis solution either through the catheter (models 1 and 2) or through injection (model 3) for 4 weeks. Then, a 4-hour dwell study using 3.86% glucose solution with an intraperitoneal volume marker and frequent dialysate and blood sampling was performed in each rat. The intraperitoneal volume was significantly lower in all the dialysis groups as compared to a control group (n = 6) in which the rats had no chronic dialysate exposure. The peritoneal fluid absorption rate, as well as the direct lymphatic absorption rate, was significantly higher in the three dialysis groups as compared to the control group. In general, no significant differences were seen in any of the parameters among the three dialysis models. Owing to catheter obstruction, three rats in model 1 and four rats in model 2 were lost during dialysis. Histological examination showed no significant differences among the three dialysis groups. Our results suggest that omentectomy may not be necessary in the chronic peritoneal dialysis model when using dialysate infusion and no drainage. Based on the present study, we think that perhaps model 1 may be the method of choice to test new peritoneal dialysis solutions. However, owing to its simplicity, model 3 could also be used if great care is taken to avoid puncturing the intestine or injecting into the abdominal wall.","643":"Migration of the peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter from the pelvis to the upper abdomen frequently results in peritoneal dialysis failure and removal of the catheter. Previous studies compared PD catheter survival in various catheter configurations. These studies included single-cuff and double-cuff, straight-end and curled-end catheters, and showed an incidence of catheter migration ranging from 5%-35% depending on the catheter type. Recent studies demonstrated that the double-cuff, Swan-neck, curled-end configuration is associated with a considerably lower incidence of migration. Most of these studies, however, had a small patient sample or no control group, or they compared nonequivalent catheters (for example, Swan-neck, curled-end versus straight, non-curled-end). Over a six-year period, we examined two similar double-cuff, curled-end catheters: Group I catheters had a straight segment between the two cuffs, and Group II catheters had a 60 degrees Swan-neck bend between the two cuffs (Quinton Instrument Co., Bothell, WA, U.S.A.). The two catheters were identical, except for the presence or absence of the Swan-neck bend. All catheters were placed by the closed laparoscopic technique. In the two groups of patients in whom the catheters were implanted, no statistically significant difference was observed in primary disease, age, sex, race, weight, prior abdominal surgery, or duration of dialysis before catheter migration. In group I, 33 of the 219 patients developed catheter migration (15%); in group II, 2 patients of 243 patients developed catheter migration (less than 1%, p = 0.002). In conclusion, the Swan-neck configuration presents an independent factor in preventing PD catheter migration. Review of previous studies and the data from our study, show that double-cuff, curled-end, Swan-neck PD catheters are superior to other catheters in regard to prevention of catheter migration and should be the catheter of choice in PD patients.","644":"The aim of the study was to use an animal model to investigate the mechanisms by which tranexamic acid (TNA) increases ultrafiltration (UF) volume. Thirty Sprague-Dawley rats were studied in three groups (n = 10, each group). Group 1 was dialyzed with conventional dialysis solution, group 2 with conventional fluid plus low-dose TNA (300 mg\/L), and group 3 with conventional fluid plus high-dose TNA (3000 mg\/L). A PD catheter was inserted into each animal, and 25 mL of the designated dialysis fluid was injected twice daily for two weeks, starting seven days after surgery. Peritoneal transport properties (PTP) were measured by modified peritoneal equilibration test (PET), and transcapillary ultrafiltration (TCUF) and lymphatic absorption (LA) were determined by using dextran 70 weekly. Histological examinations of the peritoneum were performed at the end of the experiment. Drained dialysate volume (DDV) decreased in all groups; however, a lower reduction in DDV was seen in the TNA groups. PTP increased and TCUF decreased in all groups. LA increased in Group 1, but was unchanged in the other groups. No significant histological changes of the peritoneum were observed in any group. This study confirmed that, in rats, TNA maintained UF volume by reducing LA without serious adverse effects. We may safely use TNA as a \"diuretic\" for the peritoneal membrane.","645":"Dialysate concentration of phospholipids has been used to monitor peritoneal membrane status. However, we recently found that the peritoneum has a surface layer in which phospholipids may be the main constituent. Therefore, in this study, we compared the phospholipids composition of peritoneal dialysate and of the peritoneal surface in rats. Eight male Sprague-Dawley rats were used in the study. Five rats received an intraperitoneal injection of 25 mL 4.25% glucose dialysis solution. After four hours, the rats were killed, and the dialysate was drained completely. Then 20 mL of Folch solution was infused into the peritoneal cavity for 30 seconds and drained completely. The other three rats received the Folch solution without dialysis. The effluent and Folch solution were then processed for phospholipids analysis using high performance thin-layer chromatography (HPTLC). The total phospholipids content was ten times higher in the surface layer than in the dialysate effluent. In the effluent, four clearly different components were seen: lysophosphatidylcholine (LPC), sphingomyelin (SM, 29%), phosphatidylcholine (PC, 66%), and phosphatidylinositol (PI, 4.5%). However, in the surface layer, as well as LPC, SM (20.6%), PHC (47%), and PI (6.3%), two additional components were seen, phosphatidylserine (PS, 17.1%) and phosphatidylethanolamine (PE, 8.9%). The quantity of phospholipids in the peritoneal surface of non dialyzed rats was similar to the total quantity of phospholipids (in effluent and in the peritoneal surface) of dialyzed rats. Our results suggest that: (1) a surface layer is present on the peritoneum; this layer could well be extracted by Folch solution; and, with appropriate incubation time, one can separate the surface layer without damaging the mesothelial cells; (2) the composition of phospholipids in the effluent is different from that in the peritoneal surface layer, which contains membrane phospholipids (PS and PE); (3) shielding from the peritoneal surface may be the main reason for the presence of phospholipids in the dialysate.","646":"To investigate the effect of dialysate composition on apoptosis and proliferation of human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HPMCs) in vitro, HPMCs were cultured from human omental tissue. The cells were exposed for three days to culture medium containing: (1) 3.86% glucose, (2) 1.36% glucose, (3) 1.75 mmol\/L Ca++, (4) 1.25 mmol\/L Ca++, or (5) no additions (control). Apoptosis and proliferative cell nuclear antigen (PCNA) were measured by terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated in situ end-labelling and immunohistochemistry. Protein expression of Fas and of c-Myc were measured by flow cytometry. Apoptotic cells were significantly increased in the high glucose group compared to control (137 +\/- 47 cells per field unit vs 63 +\/- 30 cells per field unit, p &lt; 0.01), but did not vary in the low glucose and low calcium groups versus control (76 +\/- 25 cells per field unit and 77 +\/- 31 cells per field unit, respectively, vs 63 +\/- 30 cells per field unit, p &gt; 0.05). Cells with positive expression of PCNA were increased in the high calcium group versus control (366 +\/- 101 cells per field unit vs 186 +\/- 76 cells per field unit, p &lt; 0.01). However, the expression of PCNA was significantly more inhibited in the high glucose group than in the control group (158 +\/- 52 cells per field unit vs 186 +\/- 76 cells per field unit, p &lt; 0.05). Expression of Fas was stimulated by high glucose (41% +\/- 16% vs 25% +\/- 8% in the control group, p &lt; 0.05). High glucose and high calcium also up-regulated the expression of c-Myc, but only the high glucose group showed significant difference from control (39% +\/- 10% vs 24% +\/- 8%, p &lt; 0.05). Our data suggest that: (1) Peritoneal dialysate could induce apoptosis of HPMCs in vitro, the degree of apoptosis depending on concentration of glucose. (2) High calcium stimulates PCNA expression by HPMCs and high glucose inhibits expression of PCNA. (3) Genes associated with apoptosis (Fas, c-Myc) might play an important role in triggering apoptosis of HPMCs.","647":"Some thirty years ago, peritoneal dialysis (PD) became a respectable modality of renal replacement therapy. That is why peritoneal membrane attracted the interest of investigators. Uremia is followed by changes in the morphology of serous membranes (uremic serositis). Uremic effects on pleura and pericardia have been studied for a long time, but the peritoneum is affected as well. The aim of our study was to examine the morphology of the peritoneum in uremic patients before the start of PD and to compare the findings with those from examinations of peritoneum in healthy controls. We examined 12 uremic patients and 10 healthy controls (kidney donors). Biopsies were taken from parietal peritoneum. The samples were prepared in the standard way for study by transmission electron microscopy (TEM). Certain pathological changes--deformation of mesothelial cells, their detachment from the basement membrane, and unusual bulging of apical surface--were identified at the light microscopy level on semi-fine sections. Paracrystalline intracytoplasmic inclusions were seen in mesothelial cells only by TEM. We hypothesize that the inclusions were causing deformation of the mesothelial cells and detachment of those cells from the basement membrane. Sacculate dilatations of rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) cisternae with partly destroyed membranes and few ribosomes were also seen, with and without densely osmiophilic filaments within cisternae. Although these changes are mentioned in the literature, the exact reason for their appearance remains unknown.","648":"Attention has been focused on cancer antigen 125 (CA125) levels in dialysate as an index for evaluating the severity of peritoneal mesothelial cell impairment. However, the method of evaluating CA125 levels in the dialysate has not been standardized. We determined that CA125 levels in the dialysate should be corrected by body surface area (BSA). Using 51 patients who had been undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD), CA125 levels in the dialysate were measured to evaluate the appearance rate of CA125 (CA125AR). Because only 18 of the 51 patients (35%) had a BSA greater than 1.73 m2, CA125 levels in the dialysate might be underestimated in other patients when absolute values of CA125 are not corrected by BSA. When correlations between corrected CA125AR and various parameters were evaluated, corrected CA125AR positively correlated with age, but negatively correlated with serum creatinine and albumin levels. Moreover, no positive correlation was seen between corrected CA125AR and the duration of PD or the peritoneal permeability test. However, in 5 patients with ultrafiltration loss after prolonged PD, the values of CA125AR persistently or rapidly decreased before transfer to hemodialysis. Although CA125 can be used as an index of peritoneal deterioration, the absolute value of CA125 should be corrected by BSA. However, it is most important to evaluate changes in CA125 in individual patients.","649":"The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) is a useful tool that categorizes peritoneal transport. However, the method has some inconveniences. Some authors suggest that measuring the sodium level in the dialysate (NaD) or the dialysate-to-plasma ratio for sodium (D\/PNa) can substitute for the PET. We applied a mathematical analysis [Fisher intraclass correlation coefficient (FICC)] to 43 PETs performed in 43 peritoneal dialysis patients (29 males, 14 females) with a mean age of 55.3 years (range: 28-85 years). Determinations of NaD, of sodium level in plasma (NaP), and of D\/PNa at times 0, 30, 60, 120, and 240 minutes were added to the usual PET determinations. After using the NaD240 and the D\/PNa240 values to calculate the cut-off values for the various peritoneal transport categories, we obtained a transport distribution very similar to that of the PET dialysate-to-plasma ratio for creatinine after 240 minutes (D\/PCr240). At the same time, the FICC showed good (0.69) and excellent (0.77) correlation of NaD240 and D\/PNa240 respectively with the D\/PCr240. Therefore either of these two methods, which are cheaper and quicker than a PET, can be used to categorize peritoneal transport with a high degree of reliability.","650":"We evaluated peritoneal membrane transport status (high, high-average, low-average, and low) of 35 patients on persistent peritoneal dialysis (PD) for 5-16 years. We noted that most of these patients (n = 21) had low-average transport by dialysate-to-plasma creatinine (D\/PCr) ratio.","651":"In continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, nutritional parameters, appetite, and transperitoneal solute movement can be modified by treatment with amino-acid-based dialysis solution (AADS). Because leptin is involved in energy expenditure and appetite regulation, we decided to examine the influence of AADS on serum and dialysate leptin concentrations. We prospectively evaluated AADS influence on leptinemia and peritoneal transport indices in CAPD patients. Nine clinically stable patients (7 males, 2 females), mean age 55.4 +\/- 10.5 years, who had been treated with CAPD for 6.1 +\/- 5.8 months, were studied. Examinations were conducted before treatment with 1.1% AADS (period I), after 3 months of AADS administration (period II), after 6 months of AADS administration (period III), and at 3 months after AADS discontinuation (period IV). The primary outcome measure was concentration of leptin in serum and dialysate. Secondary measures included anorexia incidence, nutrient intake, and nutritional parameters. Dialysate-to-plasma ratio (D\/P), peritoneal excretion, and clearance (PCl) of leptin were calculated. After 3 months of AADS administration (period II), leptinemia was transiently lower (9.8 +\/- 6.2 ng\/mL vs 17.1 +\/- 14.2 ng\/mL, p = 0.017), while D\/P (0.51 +\/- 0.44 vs 0.23 +\/- 0.19, p = 0.012), peritoneal excretion (72.9 +\/- 85.4 micrograms\/day vs 37.2 +\/- 32.3 micrograms\/day, p = 0.015), and PCl (4.02 +\/- 3.40 mL\/min vs 1.75 +\/- 1.32 mL\/min, p = 0.008) of leptin were higher than measurements obtained at entry. Anorexia incidence and daily protein and energy intakes showed no significant changes during the study. Total body mass, body mass index, and plasma concentrations of total protein and of albumin increased significantly during AADS treatment. A significant positive relation of leptinemia to total fat mass was observed when AADS was not used (periods I and IV). We conclude that administration of AADS in CAPD patients causes a transient decrease in leptinemia and increases in peritoneal excretion and in PCl of leptin, as well as dissociation of the physiological relationship between serum leptin level and total fat mass.","652":"For the present study, we investigated the peritoneal transport of fluid and solutes and the clinical outcomes of 44 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients with various peritoneal transport characteristics. Based on 24-hour urine and dialysate collections and 4-hour dwell studies [peritoneal equilibration test (PET)], the patients were divided into two transport groups by dialysate-to-plasma ratio of creatinine at 240 minutes (D\/PCr240). The groups consisted of 21 high transporters (D\/P = 0.81; mean age: 63.9 +\/- 8.2 years) and 23 patients of other transport types (D\/P &lt; 0.81; mean age: 67.1 +\/- 7.3). Mean CAPD duration was 57.14 +\/- 30.4 months and 39.14 +\/- 30.4 months respectively (p = 0.07). Estimations were made of weight, body surface area (BSA), percent body water, plasma albumin (PA), Kt\/Vurea, weekly creatinine clearance (TCCr), fluid removal, residual renal function, and normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR). The results showed that high transporters had statistically significant, lower values for: (1) peritoneal fluid (p = 0.02); (2) estimated glomerular filtration rate (GFR: 0.5 +\/- 0.77 mL\/min vs 2.15 +\/- 2.2 mL\/min, p = 0.002); and (3) nPCR (0.66 +\/- 0.16 g\/kg\/day vs 0.84 +\/- 0.23 g\/kg\/day, p = 0.003). No statistically significant differences were observed with regard to the other parameters (BSA, PA, Kt\/Vurea, TCCr). Cumulative survival rates at two and five years were 90% and 70% for all patients. No statistically significant difference was seen when comparing the survival curves of high transporters and patients of other transport types (p = 0.33, Cox's F-test). In conclusion, we saw no clear evidence that higher peritoneal permeability negatively influences clinical outcome. Other comorbid factors may be related in a more important way to the survival rate for CAPD patients.","653":"This study was undertaken to determine whether tailoring the dialysis prescription in Asian children on nightly intermittent peritoneal dialysis (NIPD), without adding high-dose therapy for cost-savings purposes, was able to achieve dialysis adequacy and improvement in nutrition. Eight children (age range: 5.5-20 years) on NIPD for a mean of 2.1 +\/- 0.6 years, were studied at baseline and at 3 months and 9 months after their dialysis dose was tailored. Dialysis adequacy was measured by weekly Kt\/Vurea and creatinine clearance (CCr). Fat-free mass (FFM) and percent body fat (%FAT) as measured by bioelectrical impedance, together with anthropometric measurements, serum total protein, and albumin, were used as indicators of nutrition. After the dialysis prescription was tailored, the mean weekly Kt\/Vurea increased from 1.89 +\/- 0.35 to 2.12 +\/- 0.54 at 9 months, and total CCr increased from 36.4 +\/- 11.51 L\/1.73 m2 to 48.30 +\/- 14.30 L\/1.73 m2. The increase occurred despite a decline in residual renal function and was attributable to significant improvements in the peritoneal clearances of urea and creatinine (p &lt; 0.05). The mid arm muscle circumference (MAMC) increased significantly (p = 0.006), while FFM increased from 25.68 +\/- 7.92 kg to 26.95 +\/- 9.83 kg, and %FAT decreased from 21.56% +\/- 8.41% to 18.66% +\/- 8.16%. The increase in FFM correlated significantly with a decrease in serum creatinine (r = -0.94, p = 0.005). In conclusion, tailoring the dialysis prescription in NIPD, without adding high-dose therapy, resulted in a trend of improvement in dialysis adequacy and some nutritional parameters.","654":"Residual peritoneal volume may play an important role in dialysis efficacy and abdominal compliance in patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD). In children on CPD, the relationship between residual peritoneal volume and different measures of body size, as well as the day-to-day variability of residual volume, have not been established. We therefore investigated, on two consecutive days, residual peritoneal volume in 25 children on CPD, using the dextran dilution technique. Residual volume was linearly correlated with body size. Residual volume was independent of body size when normalized to body surface area, but decreased with increasing body size when normalized to body weight (r = -0.62, p &lt; 0.001). Mean residual volume was 79 +\/- 25 mL\/m2, with an intra-individual day-to-day coefficient of variation of 21% +\/- 15%. Residual volume was not correlated with the duration of PD, frequency of peritonitis, or peritoneal permeability as estimated by D\/P creatinine or D\/D0 glucose. In conclusion, residual peritoneal volume is constant across the pediatric age range when normalized to body surface area. It accounts for approximately 8% of the usual fill volume in patients on CPD. Residual volume is not a major confounder of the transport status estimation obtained by peritoneal equilibration test.","655":"At 1 month, 3 months, 6 months, and more than 6 months after healed peritonitis, we evaluated repeated peritoneal equilibration tests (PETs) for small molecules such as urea, and middle molecules such as cystatin C, beta 2-microglobulin, and alpha 1-microglobulin. We analyzed a total of 104 PETs in 21 children aged 1.7-18.6 years (median: 9.9 years). Equilibration quotients (D\/P)--that is, substrate concentration in dialysis fluid (D) divided by substrate concentration in plasma (P)--were calculated after a dwell time of 4 hours. The D\/P for urea did not change after healed peritonitis. In a cross-sectional study, the D\/P for middle molecules showed an increase in peritoneal permeability between 3 months and 6 months after a healed peritonitis. In a consecutive follow-up of 4 patients for more than 6 months, beta 2-microglobulin and, more impressively, alpha 1-microglobulin showed a statistically significant increase in D\/P (p &lt; 0.05) 3 months after a healed peritonitis. All differences seen were completely reversible after more than 6 months, showing that peritoneal function is rather stable if peritonitis is healed. It is noteworthy that peritoneal dysfunction lasts for up to 6 months after a completely healed peritonitis. This period might be a vulnerable phase in continuation of peritoneal dialysis.","656":"We studied tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 (PAI-1) levels in plasma and peritoneal effluent in 10 children on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) before, and 8 and 12 weeks after, treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). Plasma t-PA and PAI-1 levels were lower in patients than in controls during the study. The plasma t-PA levels were increased by rHuEPO treatment. Although PAI-1 levels showed a tendency to increase in the early phase of rHuEPO treatment, they later returned to near baseline levels. Peritoneal effluent t-PA levels were decreased at week 8 of treatment, but returned to baseline levels at week 12. Peritoneal effluent PAI-1 levels were not changed by the rHuEPO treatment. No correlation was observed between levels of t-PA and PAI-1 in plasma and in peritoneal effluent. No correlation was seen between plasma PAI-1 levels and duration of CAPD. A significant negative correlation was found between the plasma PAI-1 levels and hemoglobin levels at week 8 and week 12. These results suggest that plasma t-PA levels can be increased by rHuEPO treatment, while plasma PAI-1 levels are associated with hemoglobin levels.","657":"The effects of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on plasma and peritoneal effluent levels of antithrombin III (AT-III), protein C (PC) activity, and protein S (PS) activity were evaluated in 10 uremic children on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The findings were compared with values obtained from ten healthy children. Levels of AT-III and of PC and PS activity in plasma and peritoneal effluent were measured before, and at 8 and 12 weeks after, rHuEPO treatment. Baseline levels of AT-III and PC activity in plasma were lower than the control values. Levels of PC activity increased during the trial, while levels of AT-III remained unchanged, and levels of PS activity decreased. Baseline levels of PC activity in peritoneal effluent were lower than those obtained during rHuEPO treatment, while no change in peritoneal levels of PS activity and AT-III was observed after rHuEPO treatment. A significant positive correlation was seen between plasma and peritoneal levels of PC activity at baseline. A significant positive correlation was also seen between plasma levels of PS activity and hemoglobin at week 12, and a significant negative correlation between plasma levels of AT-III and albumin at week 8. No correlation was found between the plasma natural coagulation inhibitors and CAPD duration. These results suggest that plasma PS activity can be decreased, and plasma PC activity increased, by rHuEPO treatment in children.","658":"Achieving immunity to childhood viral infections before renal transplantation is crucial. However, children with chronic renal failure (CRF) may respond poorly to vaccination, making it difficult to achieve immunity before transplantation, particularly if they will require transplantation at a young age. To address this problem, we developed a protocol of early measles-mumps-rubella (MMR) vaccination in infants with CRF. Nine infants received MMR vaccine at a mean age of 11.6 +\/- 2.5 months. When vaccinated, 6 of the children (67%) were on peritoneal dialysis, and 3 (33%) had CRF [glomerular filtration rate (GFR) &lt; 30 mL\/min\/1.73 m2]. Eight patients were later transplanted at a mean age of 16.8 +\/- 4.8 months. Titers were measured before transplantation in all patients. Response to vaccination was excellent, with 89% developing immunity to measles, 88% developing immunity to mumps, 100% developing immunity to rubella, and 88% developing immunity to all three components of the vaccine. These response rates were equivalent to, or slightly better than, those previously reported by Schulman for older children (19 +\/- 6 months) on dialysis: 80% for measles, 50% for mumps, 100% for rubella, and 30% for all three components. We conclude that early MMR vaccination induces immunity in most infants with CRF, even those on peritoneal dialysis. Response rates are similar to those previously reported in older children. This approach may help to facilitate transplantation in young infants by achieving immunity earlier than traditional vaccination schedules.","659":"This study investigated the effects of chronic peritoneal dialysis on thyroid function and thyroid volume of patients with chronic renal failure (CRF). We measured the levels of serum and dialysate thyroid hormones [total thyroxine (TT4), total triiodothyronine (TT3), free thyroxine (fT4), and free triiodothyronine (fT3)], thyrotropin (TSH), thyroglobulin (Tg), and thyroid volume in 10 children on chronic peritoneal dialysis [9 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), 1 continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD)] at baseline and after one year. Serum levels in patients were compared with those in age- and sex-matched healthy children and were scored as normal, low, or high. At the beginning of study, serum levels were low for TT3 in 1 patient, for fT3 in 8 patients, for fT4 in 3 patients, and for Tg in 1 patient; serum TSH was high in 1 patient. At the end of study, serum levels were low for TT3 in 2 patients, for TT4 in 2 patients, for fT3 in 9 patients, for fT4 in 4 patients, for TSH in 2 patients, and for Tg in 3 patients. At the start of the study, only TSH and Tg levels could be detected in peritoneal dialysate; other parameters could not be measured. One year later, levels of TSH had decreased in 6 patients and increased in 3 patients, and Tg had increased in 8 patients, compared with baseline levels. To determine the effect of CAPD, baseline results were compared with mean levels at the end of the study. Although the mean levels of all parameters, except Tg, had decreased after one year, only the decrease in serum TSH was statistically significant. On the other hand, only the levels of Tg increased significantly in peritoneal dialysate. The mean value of thyroid volume also decreased after a year, but all values were within the normal range, and the decrease was not significant. No correlation was found between dialysis duration and any parameter after one year. In conclusion, we found a decrease in serum thyroid hormones, thyroid volume, and TSH in chronic peritoneal dialysis patients. We suggest that the low TSH levels cannot be explained by loss in peritoneal dialysate and may be due to impairment of pituitary function.","660":"A pediatric home-care renal nursing service was initiated in our unit five years ago to provide direct respite care in the home for families on the dialysis and transplant program. This nursing post responded to parental requests for more practical support in the home. A trained children's nurse with renal and community nursing qualifications was recruited with charitable support. Between October 1993 and October 1998, 286 respite-care visits were performed. Of the visits, 57% were for children on continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), 20% were for pre-dialysis support (mainly supplementary feeding of children &lt; 5 years old), 15% were for children on hemodialysis, and 8% were for children in the post transplantation period. The age of children receiving respite care ranged from 2 months to 15 years. Distances traveled from the unit to the home ranged from 5-150 miles with visit times of 2-10 hours. Of all visits, 60% were performed during the day, and 60% involved sibling care. The parental response to home-care support resulted in the incorporation of the home-care nurse into the unit's nursing budget. The new nursing post has raised issues of the professional accountability of home-care nurses, of patient confidentiality, and of communication with multi-disciplinary team members. Reflecting upon our five-year experience of home-care nursing has encouraged us to further develop our home support program for families living at increasing distances from our unit.","661":"The CD59 membrane protein confers protection from C5b-9-mediated cell lysis. Because evidence exists for complement (C) activation and generation of C5b-9 in the peritoneal cavity during chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD), we investigated, on mesothelial cell (MC) lines, the expression of CD59 and the production of C components. Four MC lines were obtained from children on CPD, and two from non uremic children. CD59 expression on MCs was investigated with anti-CD59 monoclonal antibody (mAb) and polyclonal goat immunoglobulin G (IgG). MC lines were positive for staining with anti-CD59 mAb. Western blotting analysis of MC membrane demonstrated a band with the same molecular weight as CD59. Incubation of MC with anti-CD59 mAb abrogated the protective effect of CD59 (100% cytotoxicity). C3, C4, and C6 were detected in the supernatants of MC; in non uremic MC supernatants, C5, C7, C8, and C9 were also detectable, and C4 concentration was tenfold higher. CD59 expression confers to MCs protection from C5b-9-mediated lysis. MCs produce C factors. These findings suggest that production of complement components and expression of CD59 on MCs could play a role both in peritoneal cavity infection (decreased complement production) and in peritoneal membrane damage (decreased CD59 expression and reduced remesothelialization owing to MC lysis).","662":"To assess folate status and to evaluate the need for conventional folate supplementation in patients on dialysis, we measured serum folate, vitamin B12, and red cell folate concentrations by radioimmunoassay. Thirty-four continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients and 60 hemodialysis (HD) patients who had not been supplemented with folate were enrolled. Serum folate levels (5.8 +\/- 3.6 ng\/mL vs 2.0 +\/- 1.1 ng\/mL, p &lt; 0.001) and vitamin B12 levels (831.4 +\/- 416.9 pg\/mL vs 513.9 +\/- 213.3 pg\/mL, p &lt; 0.001) were significantly higher in CAPD patients than HD patients. The red cell folate levels (849.7 +\/- 489.4 ng\/mL vs 491.0 +\/- 253.2 ng\/mL, p &lt; 0.001) were also significantly higher in CAPD patients. The incidences of folate deficiency in CAPD and HD patients were overestimated using the cut-off value for serum folate concentration (3.0% vs 71.7%, respectively), but the incidence of true folate deficiency was lower using the cut-off value for red cell folate level (0.0% vs 10.0%, respectively). In conclusion, the true incidence of folate deficiency in stable CAPD and HD patients is surprisingly low, even in patients who may not be taking folate supplements. The need for conventional folate supplementation in patients with end-stage renal disease on dialysis must therefore be re-evaluated. Before the decision is made to use folate supplementation, measurement of red cell folate is essential to assess of folate reserves of the patients on dialysis.","663":"Apolipoprotein (Apo) E has an important role in triglyceride (TG)-rich lipoprotein metabolism, and the genotype of Apo E is associated with premature coronary artery disease. Patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) develop various abnormalities of lipid metabolism and are prone to develop accelerated atherosclerosis. To investigate the distribution of Apo E genotype, and to evaluate the influence of Apo E polymorphism on lipid metabolism in CAPD patients, we measured Apo E genotypes, serum lipid, and lipoprotein levels in 54 CAPD patients (M:F = 1:1). The most common genotype of Apo E in the CAPD patients was E 3\/3, found in 68.5%. The frequencies of the other genotypes were E 2\/3, found in 14.8%, and E 4\/3, found in 16.7%. No genotypic differences in Apo E were seen in the patients with regard to the presence of diabetes, the level of parathyroid hormone, or the transport characteristics of the peritoneal membrane. When comparing lipid levels by Apo E genotype, the total cholesterol and TG levels of E 2\/3 patients were significantly higher than those of E 3\/3 or E 4\/3 patients. The differences in high-density or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol levels by Apo E genotype were not significant. In comparing lipoprotein levels by Apo E genotype, the Apo B and lipoprotein (a) levels of E 2\/3 patients were significantly lower than those of E 3\/3 or E 4\/3 patients. In conclusion, the Apo E 3\/3 genotype seems to be the most common genotype in CAPD patients, and the Apo E 2\/3 genotype appears to be associated with high cholesterol and TG levels. These results demonstrate the need for further prospective studies in these subjects aimed at elucidating the impact of genetic variation at the Apo E locus on the development of atherosclerosis.","664":"The side effects of glucose degradation products (GDPs) in conventional peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids are well described. Using the three-compartment bag concept--that is, in situ preparation of concentrated glucose solution into a standard ionic solution--a GDP-free solution can be processed. To investigate the possible impact of this product on biological and clinical parameters, we carried out a prospective cross-over study with 31 patients, comparing the short-term effects of conventional PD and GDP-free PD solutions. Classical peritoneal parameters and ultrafiltration rate did not change during the study. After three months and after six months with the three-compartment bag, cancer antigen 125 (CA125) concentration in overnight fluid increased significantly (p &lt; 0.001) from 24.4 IU\/mL to 44.4 IU\/mL and 41.1 IU\/mL respectively. CA125 decreased significantly (p &lt; 0.01) to 21.7 IU\/mL after three months with the conventional solution. No change in hyaluronan concentration was observed. A slight increase of procollagen III N-terminal peptide in overnight effluent with the GDP-free solution was followed by a significant reduction after three months with standard solution. In summary, our data show that the GDP-free PD fluid improves mesothelial cell mass and turnover even after a short-term period of three months. A better quality of PD solution is obtained by using the three-compartment bag.","665":"Glucose has been reported to interfere in the analysis of creatinine by the Jaffe method. The potential interference of icodextrin and its primary metabolites (maltose, maltotriose, maltotetraose) on creatinine measurements has not previously been addressed. We evaluated the potential interference of icodextrin and its metabolites at various concentrations using both the Jaffe and Creatinine Plus methods. Interference was determined in samples containing 0.6-20 mg\/dL creatinine in saline solution or in plasma (n = 6), and in dialysate samples (n = 6) spiked with icodextrin, maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose at concentrations up to twofold the level found in plasma and dialysate from patients treated using icodextrin. Results confirm that no interference occurs when using either the colorimetric Jaffe method or the enzymatic Creatinine Plus method at levels up to 65 g\/L icodextrin, 2 g\/L maltose, 2 g\/L maltotriose, and 1 g\/L maltotetraose, levels representing worst-case clinical concentrations. In addition, our results confirm that comparable values can be obtained using either the Jaffe or the Creatinine Plus method for the analysis of creatinine in uremic plasma and in dialysate samples.","666":"Di(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP) is the most commonly used plasticizer in polyvinyl chloride (PVC) plastics, and is therefore a major constituent of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) bags. Because DEHP is not chemically bound, it leaches out of the plastic matrix. Recently, we found that leukocyte function in vitro is impaired by a mixture of metabolites of DEHP. In the present study, we investigated the metabolism of DEHP in patients on CAPD. The study group consisted of 10 stable patients, on CAPD for at least 6 months, using a plasticizer-containing PVC PD system [ANDY Plus (Fresenius Medical Care, Bad Homburg, Germany)]. Effluent dialysate and urine samples were collected over 24 hours, and a 10 mL blood sample was drawn. Concentrations of DEHP and its metabolites mono(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (MEHP), phthalic acid (PA), and 2-ethylhexanol (2-EH) were determined in urine, dialysate, and serum using gas chromatography\/mass spectrometry. Additionally, the degree of glucuronidation of the phthalic acid esters in urine were determined. In serum, dialysate, and urine, PA was the predominant metabolite of DEHP (0.205 +\/- 0.067 mg\/L, 0.284 +\/- 0.180 mg\/L, and 1.34 +\/- 1.00 mg\/L, respectively), but concentrations of MEHP were low (0.0100 +\/- 0.0056 mg\/L, 0.022 +\/- 0.008 mg\/L, 0.011 +\/- 0.0064 mg\/L, respectively). Urinary MEHP was glucuronidated to approximately 15%. PA was 35% eliminated as a glucuronide. Unlike healthy subjects, PD patients do not eliminate DEHP mainly in the form of MEHP or MEHP metabolites. They further break these compounds down to PA. The fact that concentrations of PA in urine exceed by far the respective serum concentrations indicates that PA is secreted by the kidney. Further research on the toxicological aspects of plasticizers in uremic patients should take these findings into account.","667":"Subjective global assessment (SGA) is a method to score nutritional status in a standardized way. The original 3-point scale has been replaced by a 7-point scale. The reliability of the latter scale has never been tested. We therefore assessed inter-observer and intra-observer reliability. Furthermore, we examined the relationship of SGA with other objective nutritional parameters. In 13 hemodialysis and 9 peritoneal dialysis patients, two nurses assessed SGA. They re-examined the same patients two weeks later. Anthropometric measurements and blood samples were taken at the first assessment. According to SGA, 2 patients (9%) were classified as severely malnourished, 6 (27%) as mildly malnourished, and 14 (64%) as well nourished. The 7-point SGA scale showed fair inter-observer reliability [intraclass correlation (ICC) = 0.72] and good intra-observer reliability (ICC = 0.88). A strong correlation was present between the 7-point SGA scale and body mass index (BMI) (r = 0.79, p &lt; 0.001), % fat (r = 0.77, p &lt; 0.001), and mid arm circumference (r = 0.71, p &lt; 0.001). Lower correlations were found with mid arm muscle circumference and serum albumin. With respect to biochemical markers, the strongest relationship was found with prealbumin (r = 0.60, p = 0.004). We conclude that the 7-point SGA scale is a valid and reliable tool to assess nutritional status among end-stage renal disease patients. We suggest that one observer or a select group of observers perform the assessments to gain maximum benefit from the reliability of the SGA instrument.","668":"This report reviews the peritoneal toxicities of hypertonic (4.25%) dextrose dialysate. In vitro incubation of peritoneal cell lines (polymorphonuclear cells, macrophages) in hypertonic dextrose solutions have demonstrated direct cytotoxicity, decreased phagocytosis and bacterial killing, and decreased production of superoxide and inflammatory cytokines and leukotrienes. Hypertonic dextrose dialysate also inhibits the proliferation of mesothelial cells and causes increased mesothelial production of transforming growth factor, potentially leading to peritoneal fibrosis. In vivo animal studies have also shown peritoneal toxicity of hypertonic dextrose dialysate. Recently, the use of peritoneal dialysate with high glucose concentration has been found to lead to the deposition of advanced glycosylation end-products in the peritoneal structures and to the development of high peritoneal solute transport. Fluid control in peritoneal dialysis should not be based on the liberal use of hypertonic dextrose dialysate. Instead, it should be achieved by restriction of salt and water intake and prescription of the peritoneal dialysis schedule (particularly the dwell time) based on peritoneal equilibration test (PET) findings. Newer osmotic agents may obviate the use of hypertonic dialysate in the future.","669":"The Ad Hoc Advisory Committee on Peritonitis Management has recommended intraperitoneal (i.p.) cefazolin and an aminoglycoside as empiric therapy for the treatment of peritonitis. Because most of our patients are on continuous cycler therapy, we developed a strategy of once-daily i.p. cefazolin and oral ciprofloxacin as empiric therapy. All patients in our unit that developed peritonitis were given a once-daily 2 g load of i.p. cefazolin, plus 500 mg ciprofloxacin orally, twice daily. Ciprofloxacin was given two hours after any phosphate binder or iron supplement. The i.p. cefazolin was allowed to dwell for at least six hours. The dialysate was then drained and chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) resumed. Organisms sensitive to cefazolin were treated for 14 days with once-daily cefazolin alone; resistant organisms were treated with alternative antibiotics. A total of 40 patients were treated with this empiric regimen. Of these, 35 (88%) successfully continued CPD therapy, 1 (2%) transferred to hemodialysis, and 4 (10%) expired two weeks after the onset of peritonitis. A total of 22 patients (55%) were treated successfully with once-daily i.p. cefazolin. Although once-daily i.p. cefazolin and oral ciprofloxacin permitted continuation of CPD therapy in most patients in this study, the therapy was not optimal. While vancomycin may have provided better coverage, recent reports of vancomycin-resistant enterococci and Staphylococcus aureus present a major concern.","670":"We reviewed the course and outcome of all Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) exit-site and tunnel infections (ESI\/TI) that occurred at our home peritoneal dialysis (PD) unit over a 3-year period (July 1995 to June 1998). We documented PA ESI\/TI in 19 out of a total of 467 patients. Of the 19 patients, 12 having local redness and tenderness but no discharge were treated conservatively with increased frequency of dressing with or without hydrogen peroxide locally. Of the 12 cases receiving local care, 7 resolved without recurrence over 14.4 months follow-up, while the remaining 5 developed persistent ESI\/TI with discharge and required treatment with antibiotics. Seven more patients who initially presented with purulent discharge also received systemic antibiotics. Only 1 of the 12 patients with PA ESI\/TI treated with antibiotics resolved; the remaining 11 patients developed PA peritonitis over a 1-month to 7-month period after the initial PA ESI\/TI. In 2 of these 11 patients, simultaneous PD catheter removal and replacement was attempted for the treatment of PA ESI\/TI, but these patients also developed PA peritonitis 1-3 weeks after the procedure. Of the 11 patients with PA peritonitis associated with PA ESI\/TI, 1 died, 6 were transferred to permanent hemodialysis, and just 4 continued PD after PD catheter replacement. Though not frequent, PA ESI\/TI is still a serious complication of home PD at our unit, resulting in ESI\/TI-related PA peritonitis and catheter loss in 58% of cases. Local treatment of mild PA ESI\/TI (redness and induration) seems to be effective. On the other hand, patients with purulent discharge are likely to develop peritonitis and technique failure despite antibiotic therapy. Early catheter replacement can be considered in these cases.","671":"Problematic peritoneal dialysis infection is a major cause of catheter loss and interruption of peritoneal dialysis (PD) therapy. In selected instances, problematic infection can be successfully treated by removing and replacing the catheter while continuing with PD. Accumulated experience has helped to define the circumstances under which a removal\/replacement procedure is likely to be safe and under which complications are likely to arise. It appears that simultaneous removal and replacement can be expected to succeed when problematic infection is associated with tunnel infection, with recurring peritonitis repetitively culturing the same organism but clearing between episodes, and with gram-positive organisms. Success is less likely in the presence of ongoing inflammation, of active infection, of gram-negative or fungal organisms, or of any evidence of intra-abdominal adhesions. We review the literature on which these criteria are based and conclude with updated recommendations.","672":"This brief review addresses the impact that several important aspects of catheter technology and exit-site care have on catheter-related infections and catheter longevity. The discussion includes exit-site microbiology, catheter configuration, exit-site care, and catheter salvage, following which a summary of recommendations is presented.","673":"The aim of the study was to investigate the characteristics of PD-related peritonitis caused by gram-negative bacteria (GNP). We retrospectively studied the medical records of 164 patients (114 males, 50 females; mean age 46 +\/- 15 years) who continued PD beyond 5 months between 1984 and 1998. The average observation time was 40 +\/- 28 months (total of 6609 patient-months). A total of 166 episodes of peritonitis occurred during that time (mean incidence: 1 episode\/40 patient-months). Of these, 35 were GNPs, and GNP incidence stayed almost constant over time. Most GNP patients (63%) recovered without complication with an average of 14 days' antibiotic treatment. In only 4 cases was PD abandoned. Clinical features of GNP were similar to those of spontaneous bacterial peritonitis (SBP). The unchanged incidence of GNP over time with advanced connection devices suggests that there are important mechanisms promoting micro-organisms of endogenous origin into the peritoneal cavity in PD patients.","674":"The purpose of our study was to compare the incidence of peritonitis between continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) treatment (Group I) and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) treatment (Group II) taking into account the same population. We compared 20 patients with a follow-up of 215 patient-months on CAPD and 252 patient-months on APD. Demographic data, diagnosis, peritoneal equilibration test (PET) results, adequacy, and peritonitis rate were analyzed. Diagnoses included glomerulopathy 35%, autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (ADPKD) 20%, Type II diabetes 10%, systemic lupus erythematosus 5%, interstitial nephritis 5%, nephrolitiasis 5%, and unknown 20%. PET results showed that the group consisted of 30% high transporters, 45% high-average transporters, and 25% low-average transporters. Kt\/V for Group I was 1.3 +\/- 0.3, and for Group II, 1.83 +\/- 0.48. Creatinine clearance for Group I was 43.64 +\/- 7.31 L\/week\/1.73 m2, and for Group II, 52.42 +\/- 13.47 L\/week\/1.73 m2. Group I presented a peritonitis rate of 8.3 episodes\/patient-month, and Group II presented a rate of 18.9 episodes\/patient-month. Gram-positive organisms were responsible for 49.8% of episodes of peritonitis in Group I (S. aureus 26.6%, S. epidermidis 16.6%, others 10%) and 83% of peritonitis episodes in Group II (S. epidermidis 46.6%, S. aureus 20%). Gram-negative organisms were responsible for 16.5% of episodes of peritonitis in Group I. No gram-negative peritonitis was seen in Group II. APD patients developed two cases of candida peritonitis. Our preliminary results show that Group II exhibited a decrease in peritonitis rate while achieving better adequacy. In CAPD and APD peritonitis, gram-positive organisms predominated. In APD, we observed an increase in S. epidermidis incidence. No gram-negative organisms were observed in APD. It seems that APD is a safer treatment owing to the lower peritonitis incidence.","675":"The term peritoneal sclerosis encompasses a vast range of peritoneal alterations, from the low clinical impact manifestations associated with chronic peritoneal dialysis, to dramatic thickening of the peritoneal membrane, which is rare, but often life-threatening. The frequency, pathology, etiopathogenesis, clinical manifestations, diagnostic criteria, therapy, and prevention of peritoneal sclerosis are reviewed. Preliminary observations from the Italian Registry of Peritoneal Sclerosis, established in the framework of a program of the Italian Society of Nephrology, are reported.","676":"Normalized clearances for urea and creatinine were compared between 121 diabetic subjects (256 clearances) and 181 nondiabetic subjects (357 clearances) on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with four 2-L exchanges daily. Urea clearance was normalized by VWatson (Kt\/Vur), while creatinine clearance was normalized by both VWatson (Kt\/Vcr) and body surface area (Ccr). Height, weight, body water (V), and body surface area did not differ between the diabetic and the nondiabetic groups. Also, renal Kt\/Vur, renal Kt\/Vcr, renal Ccr, and peritoneal Kt\/Vur did not differ between the groups. Weekly peritoneal Kt\/Vcr (diabetic group 1.36 +\/- 0.38, nondiabetic group 1.31 +\/- 0.31, p = 0.048) and weekly peritoneal Ccr (diabetic group 47.6 +\/- 11.0 L\/1.73 m2, nondiabetic group 45.4 +\/- 9.2 L\/1.73 m2, p = 0.012) were both higher in diabetic subjects. The percentage of high\/high-average transporters was higher in the diabetic group (64.9% vs 48.6% in nondiabetic group, p = 0.006). The following total (peritoneal + renal) weekly clearances were obtained: Kt\/Vur, diabetic group 2.07 +\/- 0.63, nondiabetic group 2.02 +\/- 0.56, NS; Kt\/Vcr, diabetic group 2.06 +\/- 0.78, nondiabetic group 1.92 +\/- 0.74, p = 0.026; Ccr, diabetic group 72.7 +\/- 28.5 L\/1.73 m2, nondiabetic group 67.2 +\/- 26.4 L\/1.73 m2, p = 0.013. Normalized total creatinine clearances are higher in diabetic subjects than nondiabetic subjects on the same CAPD schedule and with the same renal clearances of urea and creatinine and the same total Kt\/Vur, because peritoneal creatinine clearances are higher in the diabetic subjects. This finding is caused by higher peritoneal transport in the diabetic subjects and is not an artifact caused by the normalization process.","677":"The Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) guidelines define initiation of peritoneal dialysis (PD) as \"timely\" when dialysis is started using deteriorating renal function and nutritional indices as criteria--before the appearance of frank uremia--and as \"incremental\" when the initial dose of PD is small, bringing total clearances to or above target values, with the understanding that the dose of PD will be increased as renal function is lost. Current practice regarding timely\/incremental PD initiation was studied by analyzing the responses to a questionnaire distributed to 250 U.S. and Canadian nephrologists. A total of 89 responses were received. Only 30 responders (33.7%) practice incremental PD initiation. The more frequent reasons for not practicing incremental PD initiation included anticipated patient noncompliance, the desire to obtain the highest possible clearances, disagreement with the DOQI rationale, and late referral of patients to the nephrologists. Renal clearances were used by 58 responders (65.2%) as independent criteria to start dialysis. Creatinine clearance, at a cut-off level of 9.9 +\/- 2.1 mL\/minute, was the criterion most frequently used to start PD. Nutritional indices were used by 66 responders (74.2%) as criteria to start PD. Frequently used nutritional indices were serum albumin, body weight, normalized equivalent of protein nitrogen appearance (nPNA), and dietary assessment. The survey provides clues about research studies and educational activities that will be needed in the future.","678":"Icodextrin, a starch-derived glucose polymer with an average molecular weight of 20,000 D, has been developed partly as a response to some of the disadvantages of dextrose. It has been suggested that icodextrin solutions are able to provide sustained ultrafiltration (UF) over long dwell times of 8-12 hours in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). In this paper we describe three patients on CAPD: 2 males and 1 female aged 60, 67, and 58 years respectively, duration on CAPD 47, 60, and 15 months respectively. All of these patients, who were categorized as high transporters according to peritoneal equilibration test (PET) results, presented early signs of ultrafiltration loss with no evidence of peritoneal inflammation. Icodextrin solution was used in a single nightly exchange with 10-12 hours' dwell, for a period of 5-30 days. In all of these cases, icodextrin solution failed to provide adequate ultrafiltration and the patients returned to the previously used regime of five daily hypertonic exchanges of 3.86% glucose concentration. Although these negative results were not clearly explained, we report these three cases because they exemplify some limitations of icodextrin solution to provide adequate ultrafiltration, at least in a small number of CAPD patients.","679":"Residual volume (RV) has been measured using various methods and various solutes. This prospective study set out to determine residual volume by using various solute calculations, and to estimate mean residual volume in stable Thai CAPD patients. Complete data from 9 patients (6 males, 3 females) were analyzed. Residual volume was calculated using various solutes including sodium (Na), potassium (P), glucose (G), urea (U), and creatinine (C). The calculation using sodium was too variable to use to calculate a mean. Mean of residual volume was calculated from the other solutes as RV1 (mean of PUC), RV2 (mean of GUC), and RV3 (mean of PGUC). Mean residual volumes did not correlate with sex, body weight, body surface area, hematocrit, albumin, or membrane characteristics (drained volume). Comparing all means calculated in our study, creatinine was the solute that yielded the most accurate mean, with a correlation coefficient of 0.877, 0.965, and 0.956 for RV1, RV2, and RV3 respectively. In this study, mean residual volumes were 212.49 +\/- 100.03 mL, 255.23 +\/- 142.58 mL, and 250.42 +\/- 121.60 mL for RV1, RV2, and RV3 respectively.","680":"This brief review outlines several situations in which peritoneal dialysis (PD) can be used to address clinical situations that are out of the ordinary for end-stage renal disease (ESRD). For example, PD methodology can be used not only to treat ESRD patients with difficult psychosocial problems that obviate other dialysis options, but also to control ascites accumulation in patients with liver failure, to treat congestive heart failure in azotemic patients with progressive cardiomyopathy, to administer systemic medication via the peritoneal cavity, and to provide additional clearance in demanding circumstances. In discussing these unusual applications for PD, we open the door to extending the indications for PD to a broader spectrum of clinical problems.","681":"The progression of renal disease is reported to be more rapid in male patients than in premenopausal females. However, few studies compare the difference in dialysis therapy between males and females. We compared the efficacy of peritoneal dialysis capacity, using measurements of retention volume and pelvic cavity by helical section of computed tomography (CT) in 6 male and 6 female patients. The patients did not differ significantly in age (males: 54 +\/- 3 years; female: 56 +\/- 4 years). Males were heavier than females (p &lt; 0.05). Retention volume in the visceral cavity was significantly larger in males (1787 +\/- 43 mL) than in females (1580 +\/- 59 mL) (p &lt; 0.05). Peritoneal dialysis capacity was evaluated by peritoneal equilibration test (PET). Although no significant differences were observed in the PET data, when the PET results at 4 hours were divided by body weight in kilograms, a significant difference between males and females was seen (p &lt; 0.05). There was a mild, but not significant, correlation between the volume of the pelvis as measured by helical CT and the PET data per kilogram body weight (p = 0.07). These results suggest that gender differences in peritoneal dialysis capacity relate partially to the difference in pelvic cavity volume.","682":"Calcium antagonists are widely used for the treatment of cardiovascular diseases in patients receiving dialysis therapy. The incidence of gingival hyperplasia has been reported as 10%-20% in patients treated with calcium antagonists in the general population. However, precise reports examining the incidence or pathogenesis of gingival hyperplasia in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients are lacking. We recruited 54 CAPD patients. Three patients treated with long-acting nifedipine and one patient treated with felodipine were reported by a periodontist to have gingival hyperplasia. No patients were taking amlodipine and other calcium antagonists. After discontinuation of calcium antagonists, gingival hyperplasia disappeared within 1 month. Based on these results, we suggest that it is important to examine whether the gingiva is overgrown in CAPD patients taking calcium antagonists.","683":"The authors evaluated the nutritional status of 47 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, 26 men (age 58.9 +\/- 14.6 years, duration on CAPD 27.3 +\/- 18.3 months) and 21 women (age 56.2 +\/- 14.9 years, duration on CAPD 34.5 +\/- 23.4 months), using subjective global assessment (SGA), an established method for the nutritional assessment of dialysis patients, and bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA: body cell mass, fat mass, and phase angle). Of the studied patients, 19 were diabetic (age 59.7 +\/- 13.8 years, duration on CAPD 29.2 +\/- 19.7 months) and 28 were non diabetic (age 53.9 +\/- 14.3 years, duration on CAPD 31.5 +\/- 21.8 months. According to SGA, 24 patients were scored as well nourished (Group I), 18 as mildly malnourished (Group II), and 5 as moderately malnourished (Group III). No patient scored as severely malnourished (Group IV). Analysis of the main nutritional parameters for the subgroups revealed a proportional decrease in phase angle, with a statistically significant correlation (p &lt; 0.009) between phase angle and SGA. No significant difference was seen in serum albumin levels between patients in Group I and Group II, but the mean level was significantly lower in patients in Group III compared to Group I. The nutritional and biochemical data in diabetic patients and non diabetic patients were not significantly different. BIA phase angle seems to be a simple and reliable method for the routine assessment of nutritional status in CAPD patients.","684":"As continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients lose residual renal function, it frequently becomes impossible from them to obtain adequate dialysis unless the dialysis prescription is changed. Increasing the dwell volumes, increasing the frequency of exchanges, and using a night-exchange device or a cycler are the means available to improve adequacy. In an effort to obtain dialysis adequacy, we studied how an extra hour on cycler therapy can contribute to improving dialysis adequacy. Over 18 months, we optimized solute clearance using the PD Adequest program (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Chicago, Illinois, U.S.A.) in 70 patients. After finding the best total cycler volume, we compared the weekly creatinine clearance and weekly Kt\/V from 8-hour cycler therapy to that from 9-hour cycler therapy for the four types of membrane transport. Adding one extra hour on cycler therapy improved weekly creatinine clearance by 3-6.5 L and the weekly Kt\/V by 0.16-0.20. When patients are marginally approaching the required weekly Kt\/V or creatinine clearance, an extra hour on the cycler may help to achieve the desired adequacy.","685":"The guidelines issued for peritoneal dialysis by the National Kidney Foundation Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (NKF-DOQI) suggest initiation of dialysis at a glomerular filtration rate (GFR) of 10.5 mL\/min\/1.73 m2. We undertook this study to determine trends at a center in Philadelphia. Using the MDRD (Modification of Diet in Renal Disease) formula, we estimated the GFR (mL\/min\/1.73 m2) at the time of first dialysis for patients starting on dialysis at the center between 1994 and 1996. Data on 72 of the 86 new patients were available. Of the 72, 69 patients (96%) were black and 29 (40%) were diabetic. The estimated GFR at the time of dialysis initiation was 6.3 +\/- 0.3 mL\/min\/1.73 m2. Only 3 patients (4%) had a GFR &gt; 10.5; 25 patients (35%) had GFR &lt; 5.0. Patients with a lower GFR had more severe acidosis (HCO3 15.8 +\/- 0.5 mmol\/L vs 19.5 +\/- 0.9 mmol\/L, p = 0.0023) and greater impairment in divalent ion metabolism (PO4: 7.6 +\/- 0.2 mg\/dL vs 5.6 +\/- 0.3 mg\/dL, p &lt; 0.0001). Diabetic patients were initiated on dialysis at a higher level of GFR than non diabetic patients (7.2 +\/- 0.3 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 vs 5.7 +\/- 0.4 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, p = 0.0087). Even though diabetic patients had higher GFR and lower serum creatinine (8.6 +\/- 0.5 mg\/dL vs 11.8 +\/- 0.9 mg\/dL, p = 0.0021) than non diabetic patients, blood urea nitrogen (BUN) was similar in the two groups (89 +\/- 3.7 mg\/dL vs 96.8 +\/- 5.8 mg\/dL, p = 0.73). This difference may indicate that nondiabetic patients had a greater decline in protein intake. Finally, a trend towards initiation of dialysis at higher levels of renal function was seen with time (GFRs 5.5 +\/- 0.4 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, 6.4 +\/- 0.4 mL\/min\/1.73 m2, and 6.9 +\/- 0.6 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 for 1994, 1995, and 1996 respectively; p = 0.058, 1994 vs 1996). The trend was stronger for diabetic patients (GFR 6.3 +\/- 0.4 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 and 8.1 +\/- 0.7 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 for 1994 and 1996 respectively; p = 0.06) than for non diabetic patients (GFR 5.1 +\/- 0.5 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 and 6.2 +\/- 0.7 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 for 1994 and 1996 respectively; p = 0.22). We conclude that initiation of dialysis is delayed in urban centers, particularly in non diabetic patients, and that the current practice is far below the DOQI recommendations.","686":"Residual glomerular filtration rate (rGFR) and renal Kt\/Vurea are important parameters in clinical practice and in cohort studies. The calculation of these parameters requires analysis of urea in a 24-hour urine collection and in a simultaneously obtained plasma sample. In clinical practice, urea clearance is not always determined, but creatinine clearance usually is. The aim of the present study was to assess how well rGFR and renal Kt\/Vurea can be estimated from creatinine clearance in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients. Of new Dutch ESRD patients, 365 were consecutively included in this study at the start of their chronic dialysis treatment. The estimation models were based on a random sample of two-thirds of the patients; the models were validated on the remaining one-third. We built models for pre-dialysis and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients together (pre + PD group), and separate models for hemodialysis (HD) patients. Mean measured rGFR of pre + PD patients in the validation group was 6.3 mL\/minute. The limits of agreement (LoAs) between estimated and measured rGFR were within -1.5 and +1.5. Mean measured rGFR in HD patients was 3.1 mL\/minute (LoAs: -0.3 and +0.3). These relatively small limits of agreement reveal that, should urea clearance be missing, rGFR can be estimated by a formula in which creatinine clearance and 24-hour urine production are included. The estimation of renal Kt\/Vurea from creatinine clearance was less precise.","687":"When long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) is performed without change in the dialysis prescription, uremic symptoms appear owing to insufficient dialysis dose. In such cases, an increase in dialysate volume is required, but this increase is difficult to obtain in all patients owing to limitations in abdominal volume, lifestyle, or body weight. A combination of PD and hemodialysis (HD) is the simplest method of overcoming these limitations. Combination therapy--HD once per week for 4 hours and PD 6 days per week--was performed in our patients. The total weekly dialysis dose (urea) was calculated as follows: to convert the dialysis dose by HD to that of continuous treatment, the equivalent renal urea clearance (EKR) was calculated and added to the dialysis dose by PD. Combination therapy was performed in 12 patients. The reasons for the combination therapy included ultrafiltration (UF) loss in 2 patients, uremic symptoms in 3 patients, poor fluid management in 5 patients, umbilical hernia in 1 patient, and hydrothorax in 1 patient. Total Kt\/V per week was increased from 1.61 +\/- 0.19 to 2.05 +\/- 0.25 in these patients. In the 2 patients with UF loss, weight control became easier after the combination therapy was started, and this control was possible with hypotonic dialysate alone. In patients with uremic symptoms, the symptoms improved; furthermore, dermal pigmentation improved in these patients. In summary, the dialysis dose was increased and body fluids became controllable after inducing combination therapy, resulting in improvement uremic symptoms and increased quality of life.","688":"Patients with end-stage renal disease on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) can usually tolerate continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) without abdominal discomfort or pain. In some patients, pain or discomfort occurs with complete drain of the peritoneal dialysis solution or upon initiation of dialysis filling when the peritoneal cavity is empty. We report on the use of tidal peritoneal dialysis (TPD) as a modality to alleviate this pain. Of 136 patients in our CPD unit, 18 (13%) were complaining of pain with complete drain or upon instillation of PD fluid. All were placed on TPD after other causes for abdominal pain were excluded. Six patients were placed on 25% TPD, and 12 patients on 50% TPD. The mean Kt\/V of the patients on TPD was 2.46 +\/- 0.68. With TPD, all patients had complete relief of abdominal discomfort. Patients who develop abdominal pain with complete drain or fill when the abdominal cavity is empty would benefit from TPD and be able to continue with CPD.","689":"Access problems remain the major difficulty associated with chronic hemodialysis. Despite recent recommendations by the Dialysis Outcomes Quality Initiative (DOQI) that native arteriovenous (AV) fistulae are the optimal form of vascular access, grafts and central catheters are used by many patients. We analyzed our large Canadian regional dialysis program, which has a high prevalence of peritoneal dialysis, to examine the effect of dialysis modality choice on vascular access utilization. Point prevalence data were collected from our program in October 1997, and technique and patient survival data for the period 1990-1996 were analyzed and compared to data for the remainder of Canada from the Canadian Organ Replacement Register. Mortality rate ratios were estimated using a Poisson regression model to correct for comorbidity, age, and end-stage renal disease etiology. Of 141 in-center hemodialysis patients, 91 had an AV fistula, 1 had a polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) graft, and 49 were catheter-dependent. The program also included 20 home hemodialysis patients with AV fistulae, and 156 patients on peritoneal dialysis. No mortality risk differences between hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis are seen in our center, nor are they seen for each modality in comparison with the remainder of Canada. Technique survival for peritoneal dialysis at our center was about 80% at 2 years, significantly greater than for Canada. For the program as a whole, 49% of patients used peritoneal dialysis 35% a native AV fistula, and 15% a central catheter. For Canada and the U.S.A. respectively, the comparable data were: peritoneal dialysis, 32% and 17%; native fistula, 33% and 15%; PTFE, 19% and 41%; and central catheter 16% and 27%. These data suggest that the use of peritoneal dialysis may allow reduced use of non native AV fistula access without mortality penalty.","690":"The aim of our study was a comparison of comorbid scores, peritonitis rates, dialysis adequacy, and nutritional parameters in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Patients were separated into two groups: those who, in the course of CAPD, were ingood clinical condition and underwent renal transplantation (group I, n = 11), and those who had to discontinue CAPD treatment (group II, n = 16) owing to death caused by comorbid disease or owing to transfer to hemodialysis for technique failure related mainly to recurrent peritonitis. Clinical scores were lower in group II, showing significantly more insomnia, weakness, and anorexia. The PET D\/P creatinine, mean adequacy parameter, and urine output were similar in groups I and II. Daily protein intake (DPI) and daily energy intake (DEI) showed higher values in group I than in group II when expressed in g\/kg and kcal\/kg total body mass (TBM) respectively (DPI 1.09 +\/- 0.15 g\/kg TBM vs 0.92 +\/- 0.31 g\/kg TBM, p = 0.036; DEI 36.3 +\/- 4.3 kcal\/kg TBM vs 31.0 +\/- 9.0 kcal\/kg TBM, p = 0.048), but the intakes were not significantly different when calculated per kilogram ideal body mass (IBM). Lean body mass as a percent of total mass was 77.7% +\/- 7.8% versus 73.9% +\/- 6.8% (p = 0.048) in groups I and II respectively. Group I showed lower serum cholesterol than group II (179 +\/- 33 mg\/dL vs 231 +\/- 41 mg\/dL, p = 0.001) despite higher dietary intake of cholesterol (367 +\/- 137 mg\/day vs 251 +\/- 97 mg\/day, p = 0.016), correlating with DPI (r = +0.673, p = 0.023). Our results indicate that under conditions of similar CAPD adequacy, patients with a satisfactory course of CAPD therapy have higher dietary intake and are better nourished than those with a poor outcome. The changes in nutrition seem to be related to comorbid diseases and complications of CAPD therapy. Increased cholesterol level, associated with a diminished DPI, is prognostic of a poor outcome for CAPD patients.","691":"Many peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients undergo successful renal transplantation. The outcome is similar to that for transplanted hemodialysis (HD) patients. For delayed graft function, dialysis is necessary in the immediate post-transplant period. PD can be undertaken, with a small risk of peritonitis and other PD-related complications. Delayed graft function is less prevalent in patients who were on PD before transplantation than in those who were on HD. The dialysis modality may have an impact on graft survival. The graft thrombosis rate is unaffected by the prior mode of dialysis. Catheter-related problems are infrequent, but there must be a low threshold for catheter removal for any sign of non response to therapy for peritonitis or for exit-site and tunnel infections. PD can be undertaken successfully in the immediate post-transplant period.","692":"The proportion of U.S. dialysis patients using peritoneal dialysis (PD) continues to fall. The reasons for the decline are presumably related to reduced patient recruitment and poor patient retention (technique failure). Yet, the 1998 Peritoneal Dialysis Core Indicators Study (PD-CIS) report suggests that PD provides satisfactory \"long-term\" renal replacement for many patients, and, further, that this capacity is becoming more obvious and is beginning to mimic center hemodialysis results. Several patient characteristics suggest that the key to successful \"long-term\" PD involves the delivery of \"adequate dialysis\" and that increasing attention to PD prescription and dialysis delivery has been accompanied by an improvement in PD technique success.","693":"From 1994 to 1998, 54 Tenckhoff peritoneal catheters were implanted in 49 patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis. The implantation technique included bedside insertion of peritoneal catheters via trocar under local anesthesia. Early and late complications of this technique were comparable with surgical techniques. Cumulative survival of all catheters was 91% after one year, 78% after two years, 71% after three years, and 68% after four years. Our results suggest that the percutaneous technique for insertion of peritoneal catheters remains an easy, safe, and useful technique in the management of end-stage renal disease patients.","694":"Peritoneal transport characteristics determine solute clearance and ultrafiltration and influence nutrition; matching the prescription to the membrane type is therefore important. The prognostic implications of peritoneal transport rate are here reviewed with emphasis on high transport states. The minimal adequate dose is discussed in the light of three important issues: (1) the relative importance of the urea and creatinine kinetic parameters; (2) the potential contributions of renal and peritoneal clearance to outcome; and (3) the influence of peritoneal transport rates on minimum dose. Specific recommendations are made for the formulation of prescriptions according to membrane type.","695":"Peritoneal dialysis offers several advantages for the treatment of diabetic patients with renal failure. The diabetic patients is often affected by comorbid conditions that influence the dialytic prescription and the clinical outcome. This article reviews the pertinent pathophysiology present in the diabetic patient with advanced renal insufficiency in an attempt to make specific recommendations for the initiation of peritoneal dialysis and the formulation of an adequate prescription.","696":"We retrospectively evaluated the factors that are prognostic in long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). From 1986 to 1997, 91 CAPD patients (59 male, 32 female, mean age 48 years) entered the study. Their primary renal diseases were chronic glomerulonephritis (CGN, n = 80), diabetic nephropathy (DN, n = 10), and polycystic kidney disease (PKD, n = 1). The roles of primary renal disease, hypertension, left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH), left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF), cardiac sympathetic activity, anemia, hypoalbuminemia, and plasma concentration of parathyroid hormone (PTH) on patient prognosis were analyzed. Among the 91 CAPD patients, 26 died during the observation period. Of these deaths, 17 resulted from cardiovascular diseases including cerebrovascular events (n = 7), myocardial infarction (n = 2), sudden death (n = 7), and aortic aneurysmal rupture (n = 1). Nine patients died of non cardiovascular events. Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis and others, mainly cachexia, accounted for 2 and 7 of these deaths, respectively. The 5-year survival rate was 74%; the 10-year rate was 49%. The cumulative 5- and 10-year success rates of CAPD were 69% and 39%, respectively. DN, hypertension, severe LVH (more than 200 g\/m2), and hypoalbuminemia were contributors to poor prognosis. Among these, DN and severe LVH were the two main predictors by Cox proportional hazards model. We conclude that CAPD patients with DN or severe LVH, or both, have a greater chance of drop-out from cardiovascular events.","697":"Tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF alpha) is usually excreted by the kidney. In dialysis patients, it accumulates. TNF alpha has been implicated in the pathogenesis of malnutrition, diabetic neuropathy, and erythropoietin resistance. We studied TNF alpha plasma levels in 49 stable peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, with the aim of correlating those levels with the presence and severity of peripheral neuropathy, hypertrophic cardiomyopathy, and anemia. Kt\/Vurea' residual renal creatinine clearance (CrC), nutritional markers, and general biochemistry were also determined. The average plasma level of TNF alpha was 67 +\/- 32 pg\/mL (range: 18.1-156.3 pg\/mL; normal value 3-20 pg\/mL). No correlation was observed between TNF alpha and KT\/Vurea' but a negative correlation with CrC was seen (r: -0.37, p &lt; 0.05). TNF alpha levels were higher in patients with neuropathy as compared to patients with normal results (72.5 +\/- 32 pg\/mL vs 44 +\/- 22 pg\/mL, p &lt; 0.05). Patients with neuropathy also showed a lower CrC value (1.5 +\/- 1.7 mL\/min vs 3.9 +\/- 2.6 mL\/min, p &lt; 0.01). TNF alpha levels were higher in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LVH) with respect to normal individuals (70.4 +\/- 32 pg\/mL vs 38.5 +\/- 20.8 pg\/mL, p &lt; 0.05). Patients with severe LVH showed the lowest CrC value. A direct, significant relationship was found between TNF alpha levels and weekly erythropoietin dose (r: 0.41, p &lt; 0.05). Patients with hypertriglyceridemia or taking lipid-lowering agents showed a positive linear correlation between TNF alpha and triglycerides (r = 0.7, n = 14, p &lt; 0.05). These data suggest that accumulation of TNF alpha may contribute to the development or maintenance of some neurologic, hematologic, and cardiac complications of uremic syndrome. Loss of residual renal function conditions an increment in TNF alpha levels. These data continue to add support to the idea that TNF alpha may be considered a uremic toxin.","698":"In this study, the response to triple treatment with omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin was investigated in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients with Helicobacter pylori (Hp) infections. The study enrolled 20 CAPD patients (11 male, 9 female) who had dyspeptic complaints. The mean age of the patients was 46 (range: 21-65). The study also enrolled, as a control group, 124 patients (66 male, 58 female) who had no systemic disease, but who had upper gastrointestinal endoscopy for dyspeptic complaints. The mean age of the patients in the control group was 47 years (range: 20-74 years). Upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, rapid urease test (CLO test), and direct histologic examination were carried out to detect Hp infection. Hp infection was detected in 10 cases (50%) in the CAPD group and in 53 cases (43%) in the control group. In both groups, patients with Hp infection received the triple treatment of omeprazole 20 mg twice daily for 30 days, amoxicillin 500 mg thrice daily for 15 days, and clarithromycin 500 mg thrice daily for 15 days. To assess response to treatment, upper gastrointestinal endoscopy, CLO test, and direct histologic examination were repeated 3 months after initiation of the treatment. Hp was eradicated in all of the 11 CAPD patients (100%), and in 42 of the control patients (92%). Our results suggest that the triple treatment with omeprazole, amoxicillin, and clarithromycin for Hp infection is as effective in CAPD patients as in the normal population.","699":"The prevalence of gastrointestinal reflux disease (GERD) in hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients was assessed at a single center with a self-administered questionnaire previously used in a general population. It defines (GERD as the presence of heartburn or acid regurgitation, or both. Risk factors for GERD and GERD-associated symptoms were also evaluated. In the studied population, 29.7% of patients had frequent GERD (heartburn, acid regurgitation, or both symptoms weekly). Frequent GERD was reported by 44.7% of PD patients versus the 18.9% reported by HD patients and the 19.8% reported by the general population. PD and HD patients had similar GERD severity scores [2.3 +\/- 0.7 vs 1.9 +\/- 0.8, mean +\/- standard deviation (SD)]. PD and HD patients reported atypical GERD symptoms at rates similar to those reported by the general population, but having GERD made some atypical GERD symptoms more likely (p &lt; 0.05, Fisher's exact test). In a logistic model, age &lt; 60 [odds ratio (OR) 5.6, confidence interval (CI) 1.5-21.3], smoking (OR 4.7, CI 1.3-16.9), and body mass index &gt; or = 27 (OR 3.9, CI 1.2-13.0) predicted GERD. Sex, race, diabetes, PD, non steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs), calcium channel blockers, and coffee and alcohol use did not. GERD is more common in PD patients than in HD patients or in the general population. It is not clear whether PD per se is a risk factor for GERD.","700":"Transcellular water transport (TCWT) can be estimated by Na- sieving. However, the assumption that the initial Na+ dialysate concentration (D0) is equal to the initial plasma concentration (P0) is not true for each patient. The difference leads to Na+ diffusion from the circulation to the dialysate, which diminishes the Na+ sieving. A model was developed to distinguish transcellular water transport from Na+ diffusion. We previously found evidence that the mass transfer area coefficient of urate (MTACurate) was similar to the MTACNa+. The MTAC is the product of the elimination constant (ke) and the volume of distribution (VD), the mean intraperitoneal volume. Because VD is known, the ke Na+ in each patient can be equated with the ke urate. The Na+ mass transfer from the circulation to the dialysate by diffusion can then be calculated for any time point during a dwell (Dt). Dt was subtracted from the measured Na+ dialysate concentration at 60 minutes. The corrected D\/P Na+ then represents the actual Na+ sieving. Using 3.86% glucose dialysate, this approach was investigated in 15 stable peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients (normUF) and in 9 PD patients with low ultrafiltration (lowUF, &lt; 400 mL\/4 hours). The MTACurate was calculated according to Waniewski (W) and according to the Garred model (G). Similar calculations were also performed for the MTAC of creatinine (MTACcreat). Initial D\/P Na+ was not different between the groups. When no diffusion correction was made, D\/P60 Na+ in the lowUF group (median 0.898, range 0.870-0.949) was significantly higher (p &lt; 0.025) than D\/P60 Na+ in the normUF group (median 0.881, range 0.816-0.899). The difference disappeared after diffusion correction regardless of the correction model applied. However, at 240 minutes, D\/P Na+ in the normUF group was significantly lower than in the lowUF group (median 0.880, range 0.839-0.952 vs median 0.942, range 0.866-0.987; p &lt; 0.004). Even after correction, D\/P Na+ in the normUF group was significantly lower: 0.847 normUF versus 0.893 lowUF (Wurate, p &lt; 0.005); and 0.842 normUF versus 0.890 lowUF (Gcreat, p &lt; 0.003). The correlation between the Wurate (the best theoretical diffusion correction) and Gcreat (the least) was: y = 0.99x + 0.0037. Furthermore, Bland and Altman analyses of Wurate and Gcreat at both 60 and 240 minutes resulted in random distribution around the means, with a slight overestimation in relation to the magnitude of Gcreat, as was expected. Gcreat can be used to make an accurate estimation of the contribution of Na+ diffusion in the time course of D\/P Na+. It provides a simple way to more precisely determine Na+ sieving, and therefore TCWT. In conclusion, to avoid overestimation of impaired channel-mediated water transport, a Na+ diffusion correction should be made when D0 is not equal to P0 or in the case of a large vascular surface area.","701":"Impaired erythropoiesis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) patients receiving recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) is most often secondary to iron deficiency, either as a result of poor intestinal absorption or failure to take oral supplements as prescribed. The inconvenience of giving intravenous (i.v.) iron dextran (ID) to CAPD\/CCPD patients precluded its use in this population. We therefore examined the efficacy of bolus intraperitoneal (i.p.) iron dextran (1000 mg) on erythropoiesis in a pilot study of 14 CAPD\/CCPD patients. The patients ranged in age from 23-81 years, and all had iron deficiency (transferrin saturation 6%-23%; mean: 15.2% +\/- 1.34%). Of the 14 patients studied, 13 were receiving rHuEPO. Pre-treatment hematocrit (Hct) ranged from 21%-38% (mean: 30.2% +\/- 1.37%). After infusion of 2 L Dianeal (Baxter Healthcare Corp., Deerfield, Illinois, U.S.A.), 500 mg of undiluted ID was administered directly into the Tenckhoff catheter and subsequently flushed with 30 mm3 normal saline. The peritoneal dialysis (PD) exchange containing ID then dwelled for a period not &lt; 6 hours before standard PD resumed. A second 500 mg dose ID was given to each patient by the same protocol 3-86 days later (mean: 14 days). No complications were seen. No patient complained of abdominal pain or other subjective symptoms during infusion or during the dwell. Repeat iron studies done 1-7 months post ID (mean: 2.8 months) showed a 1.1-fold to 4.9-fold increase (mean: 1.4-fold) in mean iron levels (40.4 +\/- 3.9 mg\/dL versus 57.5 +\/- 5.5 mg\/dL, p = 0.036); a 1.1-fold to 5.2-fold increase (mean: 1.6-fold) in mean transferrin saturation (15.2% +\/- 1.3% versus 24.5% +\/- 2.6%, p = 0.008); a 1.01-fold to 1.60-fold increase (mean: 1.12-fold) in mean Hct (30.2% +\/- 1.37% versus 33.8% +\/- 1.5%; p = 0.042). The mean dose of rHuEPO was statistically unchanged (170.0 +\/- 47.4 U\/kg body weight versus 178.8 +\/- 49.6 U\/kg body weight per week; p = 0.841). Peritoneal equilibration test (PET) score 1-4 months post ID (mean: 2 months) was 0.778 +\/- 0.02 compared with a PET score at baseline of 0.767 +\/- 0.03 (p = 0.734). No significant delta was observed in blood urea nitrogen (BUN) or creatinine values. We conclude that use of bolus i.p. ID is safe, effective, and convenient, and demonstrates no short-term negative effect on peritoneal membrane integrity. Long-term effects have yet to be determined.","702":"It has been suggested that the peritoneal capillary is the major determinant for peritoneal fluid transport and that an increase in the number of peritoneal capillaries may be the reason for an increased peritoneal transport rate. In this study, we investigated the impact on peritoneal fluid and solute transport of vasodilatation (which may increase the number of perfused capillaries) by intraperitoneal addition of nitroprusside. A 4-hour dwell was performed in four groups of Sprague-Dawley rats (4-8 rats in each group) with 131I albumin as an intraperitoneal volume marker. Nitroprusside at concentrations of 0% (control), 0.0005%, 0.001%, and 0.002% was added to the 3.86% glucose solution before intraperitoneal infusion. Net ultrafiltration (NUF) was 13.2 +\/- 0.6 mL, 14.5 +\/- 0.7 mL, 13.4 +\/- 0.9 mL, and 6.3 +\/- 2.0 mL for the control group and the 0.0005%, 0.001%, and 0.002% nitroprusside groups, respectively. No significant differences in peritoneal fluid absorption rate (KE) were observed among the four groups. The intraperitoneal volume, transcapillary ultrafiltration rate (Qu), and peritoneal small-solute transport rate (glucose and urea) as assessed by diffusive mass transfer coefficient were significantly higher or tended to be higher in the 0.0005% nitroprusside group as compared to control. However, with further increase in the dose of nitroprusside, these parameters started to decrease as compared to the 0.0005% nitroprusside group, and NUF was significantly lower in the 0.002% nitroprusside group, conceivably suggesting a reduction in blood flow owing to the systemic effects of nitroprusside. Our study showed that: (1) a low dose of nitroprusside increased the peritoneal small-solute transport rate, but did not decrease peritoneal transcapillary ultrafiltration rate; (2) although a high dose of nitroprusside decreased peritoneal fluid removal, the decrease was not due to an increased small-solute transport rate, but more likely to a significant drop in peritoneal blood flow; (3) vasodilatation by nitroprusside did not change peritoneal fluid absorption rate. Overall, vasodilatation does not seem to produce a pattern of peritoneal fluid kinetics similar to that seen in high transporters, who have a higher peritoneal transport rate, lower transcapillary ultrafiltration rate, and higher peritoneal fluid absorption rate.","703":"Experiments in animals and in humans have shown that fluid loss from the peritoneal cavity to the body increases with large increments in the intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure (IPP). We have demonstrated previously that much of this fluid loss occurs to the abdominal wall and is driven by the hydrostatic pressure gradient (i.p. pressure-skin pressure) that develops across the wall whenever therapeutic or pathologic volumes of fluid reside in the cavity. We hypothesized that eliminating the pressure difference across the wall by applying an equal and opposite pressure [abdominal counterpressure (ACP)] would decrease fluid movement into the wall and decrease fluid movement from the cavity. In addition, we hypothesized that net ultrafiltration or net fluid recovery would increase with ACP. To address these hypotheses, we dialyzed rats for 3 hours in the supine position at constant levels of IPP (4, 6, and 8 cmH2O) with isotonic or hypertonic dialysis solutions containing a protein marker of fluid movement. We measured total fluid loss, fluid marker concentration in the abdominal wall, and lymph flow. In separate animals, we repeated the experiments with ACP. Total fluid loss as determined by protein clearance and fluid marker deposition in the abdominal wall was decreased in all experiments. Lymph flow was unchanged by ACP. While ACP increased the net fluid recovery in isotonic dialysis, no change was observed in the hypertonic case. Analogous experiments were carried out in six dialysis patients with or without ACP during a 4-hour dialysis with 1.5% dextrose solution performed in the supine position at i.p. hydrostatic pressure of 4-6 cmH2O. No significant difference was noted in the measured net ultrafiltration between control and ACP studies. We conclude that the careful application of ACP does decrease fluid loss (particularly to the abdominal wall) during isotonic or hypertonic dialysis in the rat. However, ACP results in improved fluid recovery only with isotonic dialysis in rats and has no effect on the recovery of fluid during peritoneal dialysis in humans.","704":"To estimate the relationship between changes in the concentration of cancer antigen 125 (CA125) and peritoneal membrane kinetics, the permeability characteristics of 44 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients who had been treated with peritoneal dialysis for at least six months were prospectively evaluated. Twenty-seven males (age 66 +\/- 6 years, duration of CAPD 35.5 +\/- 29 months) and seventeen females (age 63.7 +\/- 9 years, duration of CAPD 47.7 +\/- 32 months) were evaluated. Peritoneal equilibration test (PET) data and Adequest (Baxter Healthcare Corporation, Deerfield, Illinois, U.S.A.) data were analyzed in all patients over a 12-month period, while CA125 levels were measured in blood and dialysate samples. No statistically significant correlations were seen between the patients' age, sex, or peritonitis incidence rates, and serum and dialysate levels of CA125. Dialysate-to-plasma ratio (D\/P) of small solutes at 0 and 240 minutes also showed no statistical correlation. Statistical analysis revealed a statistically significant negative correlation (r = -0.33, p = 0.035) between dialysate CA125 and duration of CAPD. The statistically significant difference found between dialysate CA125 concentrations at 0 minutes and 240 minutes (2.32 +\/- 1.3 U\/mL vs 9.08 +\/- 6.8 U\/mL, p &lt; 0.0001), means that CA125 concentration increases with longer dwell time. These results suggest that the duration of CAPD clearly affects dialysate CA125 concentrations. CA125 may therefore be used as a useful marker to evaluate the mesothelial cell mass in longitudinal follow-up.","705":"Cancer antigen 125 (CA125) is a mesothelial product that has been directly related with mesothelial bulk in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Here, we evaluate CA125 levels in peritoneal effluent over time on PD, and relate them to changes in peritoneal function. We analyzed 27 peritoneal kinetic studies in 20 stable PD patients. Three patients dropped out of PD for peritoneal membrane failure after the last kinetic study, and six patients required a peritoneal rest period as treatment for membrane failure type I. We recorded the standardized daily ultrafiltration capacity, net ultrafiltration during the kinetic study, peritoneal mass transfer coefficients, time from onset of PD, and incidence of peritonitis prior to the study. A linear increase in CA125 levels over time was observed, and a strong correlation appears among the levels at different dwell times (r: 0.85-0.98, p &lt; 0.05). At 180 minutes, the mean CA125 concentration was 48.5 +\/- 39.7 U\/mL. We observed significant differences in CA125 levels in effluent between the group of patients who later required a peritoneal rest period and the group of stable patients (27.7 +\/- 26.3 U\/mL vs 55.7 +\/- 41.5 U\/mL respectively, p &lt; 0.05). Patients who left PD showed lower CA125 levels in effluent (31.4 +\/- 30.6 U\/mL vs 52.3 +\/- 41.1 U\/mL, p &lt; 0.1). No correlation was seen between CA125 levels in effluent and time on PD, episodes of peritonitis, accumulated days of peritoneal inflammation, ultrafiltration capacity, or urea and creatinine mass transfer coefficients (MTCs). In conclusion, we believe that serial determinations of peritoneal effluent CA125 levels may help in the early identification of patients who show abnormal responses to peritoneal dialysis or its complications.","706":"Anephric rats were maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Peritoneal permeability was assessed during a standard 4-hour peritoneal equilibration test (PET) performed with Dianeal 3.86% (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, U.S.A.). The effect of uremia on peritoneal permeability was evaluated in an experimental protocol in which each animal served as its own control. In each rat, PET1 (control) was performed before removal of kidneys and PET2 (uremia) was performed four days after removal of kidneys. Net ultrafiltration during a 4-hour exchange with Dianeal 3.86% was higher during PET1 (3.8 +\/- 2.3 mL) than during PET2 (-1.3 +\/- 3.3 mL), p &lt; 0.05. Peritoneal permeability to urea and glucose was similar in both series. Transperitoneal equilibration of creatinine concentration was faster in uremic animals: D\/P at 4 hours was 0.94 +\/- 0.06 during PET2 versus 0.77 +\/- 0.08 during PET1, p &lt; 0.001. The opposite difference was seen for total protein: D\/Px 1000 after a 4-hour dwell was 51.4 +\/- 19.8 during PET2 versus 70.3 +\/- 12.9 during PET1, p &lt; 0.05. Our results show that uremia modifies the permeability of the peritoneum to both water and solutes.","707":"Peritoneal membrane changes in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients have been widely described but poorly classified. Our aim was to identify the morphological changes occurring after CAPD treatment. To this end, 17 biopsies of parietal peritoneum (1 cm in diameter) were withdrawn at least 5 cm from the catheter entry hole and stained with Van Gieson, hematoxylin-eosin, trichrome, and some immunohistochemical stains: keratin, vimentin, CD34, CD20, CD4, CD8, desmin, and collagen IV. The morphology of mesothelium, vessels, and basement membrane (BM) of mesothelium and vessels, the presence of inflammatory cells, fibrin, and calcifications, and the distribution and thickness of submesothelial tissue were evaluated. Patients were divided into three groups according to the thickness of the sclerotic band replacing mesothelium: group 1, band up to 40 microns; group 2, band less than 40 microns; group 3, no sclerotic band. The main histopathological alterations noted were: loss of mesothelium; sclerotic alteration of vessels or duplication of BM; presence of myofibroblasts; and presence of inflammatory cells (sparse, focal, or perivascular), mainly represented by macrophages and CD4+ lymphocytes. No significant qualitative differences were observed between the three groups. In conclusion, the variable histological changes in peritoneal membrane suggest a routine peritoneal biopsy in any surgical procedure to better understand pathological changes in the course of CAPD treatment.","708":"Polyglucose (PG) solution has been shown to be capable of inducing peritoneal ultrafiltration despite its hypo-osmolality. However, the mechanism of osmosis by PG is not clear. In this study, we compared the fluid kinetics of albumin (ALB) solution (thought to be an ideal solution that should induce ultrafiltration through colloid osmosis) and PG solution. A 4-hour dwell study with frequent sampling was conducted in Sprague-Dawley rats (six rats in each group). The study used 25 mL of dialysate buffer, 10% ALB dialysis solution, 15% ALB dialysis solution, 20% ALB dialysis solution, or 7.5% PG solution, with 131I albumin as an intraperitoneal volume marker. All solutions were prepared by adding ALB or PG to a base dialysis solution (without osmotic agent). The initial osmolality values of the five solutions were 250 mOsm\/kg, 284 mOsm\/kg, 300 mOsm\/kg, 320 mOsm\/kg, and 280 mOsm\/kg, and the dialysate drainage volumes at 4 hours were 17.0 +\/- 0.8 mL, 22.4 +\/- 0.8 mL, 25.4 +\/- 0.6 mL, 27.3 +\/- 0.9 mL, and 26.3 +\/- 0.6 mL (buffer, 10% ALB, 15% ALB, 20% ALB, and 7.5% PG groups, respectively). The higher initial osmolality in the ALB groups was partially due to the sodium content in the ALB powder. The intraperitoneal volume was decreasing in the 10% ALB group, rather stable in the 15% ALB group, but slowly increasing in the 20% ALB group. In the PG group, intraperitoneal volume decreased initially and then started to increase after 2 hours. This pattern was closely related to the increase in the dialysate osmolality (to higher than plasma level). At 4 hours, the dialysate osmolality was significantly higher (and higher than plasma level) in the PG group as compared to all the ALB groups. No differences in peritoneal fluid absorption rate were observed among the four treatment groups. In the 15% ALB and 20% ALB groups, the transcapillary ultrafiltration rate (Qu) was lower in the later part of the dwell than in the initial part of the dwell; in the PG group, the opposite pattern was observed. Our results suggest that the osmosis of albumin dialysis solution is different from the osmosis of polyglucose solution. Polyglucose solution induces net ultrafiltration only when the dialysate osmolality increase to higher than plasma level, suggesting that degradation of polyglucose may be important for effective ultrafiltration.","709":"Peritoneal dialysis solutions containing icodextrin are ideal for providing sustained ultrafiltration during long dwells, and they have replaced high glucose for long dwells in some patients. The biocompatibility of these solutions, especially in regard to glucose degradation products, has not been studied in depth. The object of this study was to compare the effects of commercially available dextrose-containing dialysis solutions to those of icodextrin-containing solutions on fibroblast proliferation in vitro. We measured the effect of solutions on cell growth by exposing murine fibroblasts to pH-adjusted test solutions mixed with culture medium, and by comparing cell growth to growth in culture medium only. No statistical difference was observed in the growth of cells exposed to heat-sterilized Extraneal [7.5% icodextrin (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, U.S.A.)], heat-sterilized Dianeal [1.5% dextrose (Baxter Healthcare)], or filter-sterilized Dianeal [4.25% dextrose (Baxter Healthcare]. Also, no difference was observed in the growth of fibroblasts exposed to heat-sterilized Extraneal or to filter-sterilized Extraneal, but heat-sterilized Dianeal [4.25% dextrose (Baxter Healthcare)] caused a significant reduction in cell growth. Glucose degradation products (GDPs) are known to contribute to reduced cell growth in vitro. Extraneal had lower levels of the GDP acetaldehyde compared to Dianeal (2.5% or 4.25% dextrose). The results demonstrate enhanced in vitro biocompatibility characteristics for Extraneal, possibly related to low GDP levels in Extraneal.","710":"Extraneal peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution (Baxter Healthcare, Deerfield, Illinois, U.S.A.) contains glucose polymer (icodextrin) as an osmotic agent in place of dextrose. We investigated the ability of Extraneal to form advanced glycation end products (AGEs) in vitro compared to standard PD solutions containing dextrose. Extraneal, Dianeal PD-2 [1.5%, 2.5%, or 4.25% dextrose (Baxter Healthcare)], or phosphate buffered saline (PBS) were incubated for 45 days with human serum albumin (HSA) or type IV collagen. AGE formation was measured by spectrofluorometry using excitation at 350 nm and emission at 430 nm. Solutions were also incubated with collagen affixed to plastic, simulating matrix collagen in the peritoneal membrane. In addition, AGE formation was assessed using icodextrin metabolites (maltose, maltotriose, and maltotetraose) at concentrations normally found in the plasma of patients treated using icodextrin. For PD solutions incubated with albumin, the relative order of AGE formation was: 4.25% dextrose &gt; 2.5% dextrose &gt; 1.5% dextrose &gt; Extraneal. For incubations with collagen (in solution or affixed to plastic), AGE formation was greatest for 4.25% dextrose, intermediate for Extraneal and 2.5% dextrose, and lowest for 1.5% dextrose. Incubation of icodextrin metabolites with albumin for 45 days did not result in appreciable AGE formation. These results confirm that solutions containing icodextrin result in less in vitro AGE formation than do high dextrose solutions. The results also suggest that Extraneal may lead to improved solution biocompatibility in vivo.","711":"Calcium channel blocker given intraperitoneally (i.p.) in rats was reported to increase urea D\/P ratio without protein loss. Chlorpromazine (CP) given i.p. in humans was reported to increase ultrafiltration (UF) and urea clearance. We studied the effects of i.p. Diltiazem (DZ) (15 mg\/kg) and i.p. chlorpromazine (0.25 mg\/L dialysate)--given alone or in combination--on urea D\/P ratio, dialysate protein (Dpro), glucose concentration (Dg), UF, and drainage volume (Vd). Six male Sprague-Dawley rats were studied. The rats underwent 21 consecutive 30-minute exchanges with 15 mL of 1.5% of Dianeal solution (Baxter Healthcare Inc., Deerfield, Illinois, U.S.A.). DZ or CP was added to the dialysis solution during exchanges 4-6 and 10-12. During exchange 16-18 both DZ and CP were added to the dialysis solution. Exchanges 1-3, 7-9, 13-15, and 19-21 were control exchanges performed with 1.5% Dianeal solution alone. The mean weight of the rats was 541.6 +\/- 44 g. The animals' blood pressure remained stable during the study period. An increase in D\/Purea ratio was observed with DZ, with CP, and with the two drugs in combination, without increase in dialysate protein loss. An increase in UF with a decrease in D\/D0 was observed with DZ, with CP, and with the two drugs in combination, suggesting a mechanism other than osmotic gradient--such as increased blood flow or decreased surface tension.","712":"To analyze the regulation of water channels in the peritoneum, we tried to establish a primary mesothelial cell culture system. Male Sprague-Dawley rats weighing about 250 g were anesthetized, and 10 mL of phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) containing 0.25% trypsin and 1 mmol\/L ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid (EDTA) was infused into the peritoneal cavity for 15 minutes. Sediments from the recovered fluid were cultured in medium M199 supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS). The culture was succeeded 4-6 times before experiments commenced. After exposure to the test medium, RNA was extracted and subjected to reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) for 10-19 cycles, then was measured by Southern blot analysis with a digoxin-labeled probe. Cultured cells were positively stained with mouse monoclonal anti-cytokeratin antibody, confirming their characteristics as mesothelial cells. Aquaporin-1 (AQP-1) message in the cultured cells increased with increases in glucose and mannitol concentrations when beta-actin message was used as an internal control. Tranexamic acid effected no change in AQP-1 message in the cultured mesothelial cells. This system offers potential as a simple approach to test the effects of osmolytes, cytokines, and vasoactive hormones on aquaporin expression and water transport in the peritoneum.","713":"","714":"A specialist pediatric renal nursing service provides a link between hospital and home. Such support aims to reduce hospitalization and disruption to schooling and family routine. A 3-year prospective study monitored the progress and documented the nursing support to and contacts with 13 children (5 of whom were under 5 years of age) who commenced continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). Mean duration of CCPD was 14 months. Home and clinic contacts included telephone calls (65% of contacts), home, school, nursery, respite care, and community visits. Nine families received respite care from a home-care pediatric renal nurse, with children under 5 years receiving 68% of such visits. A total of 388 inpatient days were recorded. These included admission for catheter and dialysis training (125 days). hypertension (83 days), dialysis-related admissions (66 days), peritonitis (43 days), vomiting (31 days), and surgical procedures and infections (40 days). Nine peritonitis episodes occurred in 8 children (incidence 1 per 20 patient-months), and one death (cardiovascular collapse) occurred on CCPD. Seven children received a transplant, with the median waiting time for transplant being 7 months (range: 3-14 months). This study documents the spectrum of nursing support we have evolved to support children on CCPD and their families in the hope of reducing morbidity and hospitalization.","715":"Options for the management of infants with hyperkalemia secondary to renal insufficiency are limited for infants not maintained on dialysis. Precipitation of potassium (K+) from infant formula with sodium polystyrene sulfonate (KX) prior to feeding has been reported. However, its effect on calcium (Ca2+) and sodium (Na+) has not been quantitatively defined. The purpose of this study was to examine the effects of two K+ exchange resins: KX and calcium polystyrene sulfonate (RC) on Na+, K+, and Ca2+. Infant formula powder (Similac PM 60\/40, Ross Laboratories, Columbus, OH, USA) was prepared with deionized water (DW) and KX or RC (1 g\/mEq of K+) was added. The formula was decanted after 50 minutes and Na+, K+, and Ca2+ were assayed in the supernatant. Na+ and K+ were also assayed in ready-to-feed PM 60\/40 (RTF). KX decreased the K+ concentration by 4.5 fold (P &lt; 0.001) and increased the Na+ content by 3.8 fold (P &lt; 0.001). In RC there was a 1.6-fold increase in Ca2+ content (P &lt; 0.001), and a 13% decrease in K+ concentrations (P &lt; 0.05). Preparation of the formula with DW reduced the K+ concentration by 30% compared to ready-to-feed formula (P &lt; 0.001). We conclude that, although KX significantly reduces the K+ content of formulas, DW may be a more practical and convenient method of preparing formula for the hyperkalemic infant.","716":"Nasogastric and gastrostomy feeding are beneficial in providing nutritional support to children on chronic dialysis, but concerns have been raised about transfer to exclusive oral nutrition postrenal transplantation (TX). The present study reports the growth data and feeding outcomes in 14 children (9 male) who received combined dialysis [continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD): n = 12; hemodialysis (HD): n = 2] and gastrostomy button (GB) feeding for a mean duration of 15.6 months, and who were transplanted at a mean age of 5.4 years. In 12 patients GB feeding was discontinued shortly after TX, and in 2 it was maintained for 3 and 8 months, respectively. No infective episodes were attributable to the GB post-TX, and the buttons were usually removed within 3 months with the dialysis catheter. The mean height and weight standard deviation scores (SDS) were -2.44 and -2.29, respectively, prior to dialysis and GB feeding; -2.19 and -1.22, respectively, prior to TX; and had improved to -1.6 and -0.79, respectively, 12 months post-TX. The mean percentage weight-for-height at the time of TX was 105% (range: 86%-128%), and was unchanged 1 year post-TX. We conclude that GB feeding in this group of children resulted in few complications or feeding problems post-TX. The use of GB feeding without growth hormone maintained growth parameters in most children while on dialysis, and a significant improvement in growth occurred after the renal transplantation.","717":"Use of intraperitoneal insulin in diabetic end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is known to result in improved glycemic control. This route of insulin administration, although standard in adult diabetic CAPD patients, has not previously been reported in children. A 12-year old boy with ESRD from renal dysplasia who also had insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus (IDDM) was treated with CAPD and intraperitoneal insulin prior to renal transplantation. Diabetes and renal dysplasia were both diagnosed at 11 weeks of age. When he reached end-stage he was initially started on hemodialysis via a central line but was switched to CAPD because of recurrent line sepsis. His IDDM had been poorly controlled up to that time. CAPD was performed using 4 exchanges per day of 1.5% dialysate with a fixed dose of insulin added to each bag and with adjustments made based on blood glucose. His glycemic control markedly improved, with a fall in his glycosylated hemoglobin from 13.6% to 6%. CAPD was continued for 7 months until a living-related renal transplant was performed. Two episodes of peritonitis occurred while the patient received CAPD (1 episode\/3.5 patient-months). We conclude that the use of intraperitoneal insulin in children with IDDM and ESRD leads to improved glycemic control. The rate of peritonitis, however, may be increased in these children.","718":"The known relationship between peritoneal fill volume (IVP) and dialysis efficiency favors the use of an optimal IVP to enhance peritoneal dialysis (PD). Therefore, we have studied the effects of an increased IVP in consecutive stages [800, 1400, and 2000 mL\/m2 of body surface area (BSA), respectively] in 8 children on chronic PD (mean age: 9 years 6 months; range: 2-16 years). Each prescribed IVP was maintained for 60 minutes of dwell time, allowing a short peritoneal equilibration test. Tolerance was assessed clinically and by intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) measurements at the end of each dwell test. Determination of dialysate-to-plasma ratios, and calculation of mass transfer area coefficients (K0A) using the Henderson method for urea, creatinine, and phosphate, were used to assess the impact of an increased IVP on dialytic efficiency. Increasing IVP from 800 to 1400 and thereafter to 2000 mL\/m2 induced an IPP increment, respectively, from 8.4 +\/- 1.4 cm (of water) to 12.1 +\/- 1.4 cm and thereafter to 18.3 +\/- 1.4 cm, with a positive strong linear correlation (r = 0.92; P = 0.001; IPP = 1.46 +\/- 8.17(-3) IVP). In the same manner increasing IVP induced K0A increments for urea of 10.6 +\/- 1.2 mL\/min per m2 to 15.3 +\/- 1.6 mL\/min per m2 and 17.1 +\/- 1.9 mL\/min per m2; for creatinine of 7.9 +\/- 0.09 mL\/min per m2 to 11.2 +\/- 0.18 mL\/min per m2, and 12.3 +\/- 0.21 mL\/min per m2; and for phosphate of 5.2 +\/- 0.08 mL\/min per m2 to 6.7 +\/- 0.09 mL\/min per m2 and 6.6 +\/- 0.07 mL\/min per m2, respectively. When K0A values were normalized to the values achieved at the IVP of 1400 mL\/m2, the K0A gain obtained increasing IVP from 1400 to 2000 mL\/m2 was only significant for urea, peaked for creatinine, and even slowly decreased for phosphate. Moreover, a fill volume over 1400 mL\/m2, which appears to be the optimal volume in terms of dialysis efficiency, was only barely tolerated with clinical signs of discomfort and an increased IPP. Therefore, in our opinion, the maximal IVP in children over the age of 2 years should be nearly 1400 mL\/m2, both in terms of abdominal tolerance and in terms of urea, creatinine, and phosphate peritoneal membrane purification capacities.","719":"The aim of this study was to evaluate systolic and diastolic cardiac functions in children treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). This study included a total of 21 patients (12 boys, 9 girls), aged 23 months to 14 years (average age: 10.1 +\/- 4.32 years). The mean duration on CAPD was 12.88 +\/- 6.69 months (range: 2-22 months). Twenty age- and sex-matched healthy subjects served as controls. Evaluation was made at the beginning of CAPD treatment in these 21 patients. Tests were repeated in 9 of 21 patients who had completed a 1-year follow-up period. We measured systolic functions [ejection fraction (EF), and fractional shortening (FS)], and diastolic functions [early (E) and late (A) diastolic peak inflow velocities, and E\/A ratio, as well as early diastolic flow deceleration velocity (EF slope) and time (dt) functions] using two-dimensional, M-mode, color Doppler echocardiography. Interventricular septum thickness was also recorded. Blood pressure (BP) levels were monitored serially in all patients. Statistical evaluation was made using Student's t-test. Compared with control subjects, systolic and diastolic parameters were significantly inversely affected in patients on CAPD (P &lt; 0.05). The mean BP levels did not differ significantly between CAPD patients and controls. In 9 patients with a second measurement on CAPD, systolic and diastolic cardiac functions tended to have deteriorated. However, these changes were not statistically significant (P &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, CAPD is the preferable option in children with end-stage renal disease to maintain stable cardiac functions. However, systolic and diastolic dysfunctions tend to progress in children on CAPD.","720":"Fungal peritonitis (FP) is a rare complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Although treatment with fluconazole (FCZ) has improved catheter survival and preservation of the peritoneal membrane, FP still carries a high morbidity and mortality in pediatrics. High-risk factors for FP include previous usage of systemic antibiotics and recurrent bacterial peritonitis. A prospective experience in the treatment of FP was conducted at the University of Miami\/Jackson Children's Hospital from 1992 to 1997. All patients received either oral or intravenous loading dose of FCZ (5-7 mg\/kg) followed by intraperitoneal (i.p.) FCZ (75 mg\/L). Amphotericin B (amp B) was added when clinical sepsis was present. A total of 6 patients had FP (all Candida sp.; mean age: 6 years). Two of these patients were neonates with Tenckhoff-catheter placement at less than 1 week of age. Five patients achieved sterilization of the peritoneal fluid. One patient required catheter removal (C. tropicalis). The 2 neonates were infection free for 29 and 41 days, respectively, but both died of superimposed bacterial sepsis. The remaining 4 patients survived and completed 6 weeks of FCZ treatment. Two have had preservation of the peritoneal membrane for more than 1 year. The other 2 were switched to hemodialysis. We conclude that FCZ is an effective treatment for fungal peritonitis in pediatric patients. Adjunct therapy with amp B is usually necessary if sepsis is present. Although eradication of the fungus is possible in a majority of cases, neonates and immunocompromised hosts remain at high risk for morbidity and mortality.","721":"Fungal peritonitis is a rare event in patients receiving peritoneal dialysis. This case report describes the blood and dialysate concentrations of fluconazole and amphotericin B following intravenous administration in a 5-month-old infant with Candida albicans peritonitis receiving continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis. Fluconazole rapidly and efficiently penetrated the peritoneal fluid achieving concentrations that exceed the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) for most Candida species. In contrast, the amount of amphotericin B in the dialysate was below the limit of quantification despite measurable blood concentrations. This suggests that fluconazole represents a better choice for antifungal therapy because of its excellent peritoneal penetration.","722":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate whether immunologic status could predict the development of peritonitis in children on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Twenty-one patients (12 boys, 9 girls) aged 10.1 +\/- 4.32 years (range: 23 months to 14 years) were studied. The mean duration of CAPD treatment was 12.88 +\/- 6.69 months (range: 2-22 months). Twelve healthy children (mean age 11.5 years) were selected as a control group. Lymphocyte subpopulations (CD3, CD4, CD8, CD19, NK, and IL-2R) were determined by double-color flow cytometry (Becton-Dickinson). Statistical evaluation was made by Student's t-test. CD4 (38.4 +\/- 7.1% vs. 28.0 +\/- 5.4%), CD4\/CD8 ratio (1.30 +\/- 0.4 vs. 0.96 +\/- 0.3), and B lymphocyte (19.9 +\/- 8.9% vs. 12.0 +\/- 3.2%) levels were significantly higher in CAPD patients compared with controls. CAPD patients showed significantly lower natural killer (NK) cell values than controls (12.7 +\/- 7.0% vs. 27.3 +\/- 8.3%). Apart from CD19 values (21.9 +\/- 10.4% vs. 12.0 +\/- 3.2%) there were no significant differences between CAPD patients without infection and the control group in the laboratory parameters studied. On the other hand, CD3 (66.3 +\/- 7.9% vs. 55.9 +\/- 9.7%), CD4 (38.4 +\/- 7.1% vs. 28.0 +\/- 5.4%), and CD19 (6.3 +\/- 3.3% vs. 12.0 +\/- 3.2%) levels were significantly higher in CAPD patients with infection compared with the controls. CAPD patients with infection showed significantly lower NK activity (12.7 +\/- 7.1% vs. 27.3 +\/- 8.3%) than those in the control group. In conclusion, these results can explain the increased vulnerability to peritonitis in CAPD patients compared with healthy subjects. Additionally, immunologic status can predict the development of peritonitis in children treated with CAPD.","723":"The present study was designed to assess the effect of intraperitoneal infusion of immunoglobulin (Ig) on neutrophil functions in uninfected and infected patients treated by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Fourteen children were included in the study. Healthy laboratory and medical personnel (n = 10) served as controls. Blood and peritoneal dialysate effluent (PDE) samples were obtained before and after Ig infusion. In all patients, chemotactic response of peripheral blood neutrophils (PBN) was significantly lower than in healthy controls. Peripheral blood neutrophils obtained from patients during peritonitis episodes (n = 10) showed significantly higher values compared to the values obtained from patients without peritonitis (n = 12). After the intraperitoneal infusion of Ig (100 mg\/kg), chemotaxis of PBNs increased significantly in both patient groups. Chemiluminescence measures of PBN of the uninfected (n = 12) and infected patients (n = 7) were similar. They increased significantly in both groups after the Ig infusion, although they remained within the lower limits of the controls. The peritoneal neutrophils (PNs) showed significantly lower chemotactic activity in uninfected patients (n = 11) than in the infected ones (n = 10). The response of PNs to the Ig infusion was also more prominent in infected patients. Immunoglobulin infusion did not increase the chemiluminescence of PNs in infected patients (n = 7); the chemoluminescence of PNs did increase after Ig infusion in uninfected patients (n = 12). These data suggest the of administration intraperitoneal Ig for prophylaxis and\/or treatment of peritonitis in CAPD patients.","724":"Before the advent of recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO), androgens were used for treatment of anemia in dialysis patients. However, after the availability of recombinant EPO in the 1980s, the use of these substances was abondoned. We have previously reported that androgens have beneficial actions on anemia in selected hemodialysis patients. In the present study we have analyzed the effects of androgen administration on hematologic parameters in peritoneal dialysis patients. We evaluated 9 patients treated for 6 months with nandrolone decanoate (200 mg\/week intramuscularly). Hemoglobin and hematocrit values experienced a significant increment with respect to basal values during the study (9.2 +\/- 0.7 g\/dL and 27.7% +\/- 2.3% at basal vs. 11.9 +\/- 0.5 g\/dL and 35.3% +\/- 1.6% at month 6, respectively; P &lt; 0.001). In addition to the effects on the hematologic parameters, androgen administration also had beneficial anabolic actions with a significant increment in the serum concentration of total proteins and albumin (basal, 6.1 +\/- 0.3 g\/dL and 3.1 +\/- 0.4 g\/dL vs. 6.7 +\/- 0.4 g\/dL and 3.8 +\/- 0.4 g\/dL at month 6, respectively, P &lt; 0.01). The only adverse effect was a rise in the serum concentration of triglycerides (176 +\/- 54 mg\/dL vs. 144 +\/- 53 mg\/dL, P &lt; 0.01). In conclusion, androgen administration has beneficial effects on erythropoiesis as well as positive anabolic actions in patients under peritoneal dialysis.","725":"In recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo)-treated anemic peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, oral iron therapy, despite its limited efficacy, remains an accepted and convenient method of iron supplementation. In this study, we compared infusion of total dose iron (ITDI) to oral iron for the treatment of anemia in PD patients. Thirteen patients with serum transferrin saturation (TSAT) &lt; 25% received ITDI and 11 patients with TSAT between 25% to 35% received oral iron. Doses of rHuEpo were adjusted monthly to maintain target hematocrit at 35%. Both groups had similar baseline mean hematocrits (31.0 +\/- 0.9% vs. 33.0 +\/- 1.0%), and comparable mean baseline weekly rHuEpo dose (7886 +\/- 1449 units\/week vs. 6370 +\/- 1553 units\/week). At the end of the 6-month study, the ITDI group had a 16% improvement in mean hematocrit compared to baseline. The final mean dose of weekly rHuEpo was also reduced by 59% in the ITDI group. During the same period, compared to baseline, the oral group had a 4.8% fall in mean hematocrit despite 51% higher requirement of rHuEpo doses. There was no adverse reaction to intravenous iron. We conclude that ITDI is the preferred treatment for iron supplementation in rHuEpo-treated anemic PD patients.","726":"Plasma concentrations of lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] are increased in patients on renal replacement therapy. Lipoprotein (a) is increasingly being recognized as an independent cardiovascular risk factor. In an effort to explore the mechanism for elevation of Lp(a) in patients on dialysis we have performed turnover studies of Lp(a) with radioactive iodine. Lp(a) was isolated from 1 patient on hemodialysis (HD) and 1 patient on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD); the protein was labeled with 125I and returned to each patient. Lipoprotein (a) was subsequently isolated from the patients over a 15-day period and the decay of the specific radioactivity of Lp(a) was used to determine the fractional catabolic rate (FCR), which was 0.27 (pool\/day) for the HD patient and 0.28 (pool\/day) for the CAPD patient. These rates are indistinguishable from those measured in 4 patients with hypercholesterolemia (0.29, SEM = 0.01) and in 4 other familial hypercholesterolemic patients (0.29, SEM = 0.02) studied previously using the same method by Knight et al. (7). We found no difference in the FCR of patients on dialysis when compared to patients with hyperlipidemia and normal renal function. Increased plasma concentration of Lp(a) in our patients on renal replacement therapy is not due to decreased catabolism, but is caused by increased synthesis.","727":"Dry weight is difficult to determine in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Bioimpedance spectroscopy using a multi-frequency analyzer was used to measure total body water, extracellular water, and intracellular water in 7 female CAPD patients and, for comparison, in 6 normal female controls. One patient was measured a second time after a 10-kg fluid loss. Mean weight in controls and CAPD patients was similar, as was the percent of body weight that was water. However, the ratio of extracellular water to intracellular water was 0.814 in controls but 1.11 in CAPD patients, suggesting either more extracellular water and\/or less intracellular water in the CAPD patients compared to the controls. When analyzed, the percent of total body water that was extracellular was significantly greater in the CAPD group. There was also a significant reduction in the percent of intracellular water that contributed to body weight in the CAPD patients. Body cell mass was 38.1% in controls but only 30.2% in CAPD patients. Serum albumin concentration ranged from 2.1 to 4.2 g\/dL in CAPD and a linear relationship was present between serum albumin concentration and cell membrane capacitance. We conclude that 60% of body weight as body water may be an overestimate of volume (V) when the formula Kt\/V is used to measure adequacy, and that bioimpedance spectroscopy may be a useful technique for assessing both fluid balance and body cell mass or nutritional status in CAPD patients.","728":"Though serum albumin (SA) and Kt\/V predict mortality in peritoneal dialysis (PD), the relationship between them remains unclear. We report a cross-sectional study of factors associated with SA in PD, and a prospective study of the effect of increasing dialysis dose on SA in hypoalbuminemic patients with Kt\/V &lt; 2.1. Multiple linear regression was performed in 56 subjects with dependent variable SA at 4 months after starting PD (SA2), and independent variables: age, sex, diabetes, 4h-D\/Pcr, predialysis SA (SA1), nPCR, PD-duration, modality, Kt\/V, Ccr, and daily volume excreted normalized to body water (Vt\/V). Forward stepwise selection (alpha = 0.05) produced a model (r2 = 0.492, P &lt; 0.001) containing predictors of SA2: SA1 and nPCR (positive), and Vt\/V (negative). With Vt\/V excluded, Kt\/V became significant (negative). Broken into components, dialysate Kt\/V was significant, but residual Kt\/V was not significant. In 14 hypoalbuminemic patients with Kt\/V &lt; 2.1, PD prescription was changed, targeting a Kt\/V &gt; 2.1. After 3.3 months, Kt\/V rose from 1.7 +\/- 0.25 to 2.21 +\/- 0.36 (P = 0.0001), and nPCR rose slightly, 0.71 +\/- 0.13 to 0.78 +\/- 0.19 (P = NS), with no significant change in SA, 30.5 +\/- 3.0 g\/L to 31.4 +\/- 3.8 g\/L (P = 0.268). Dialysate and urine volumes are negative predictors of SA. Volume-dependent dialysate-protein loss could account for poor correlation between Kt\/V and SA, and lack of improvement in SA with increased Kt\/V.","729":"To define protein anabolism or catabolism in our patients we retrospectively studied the 24-hour balances (B24 h), dietary protein intake (DPI), anthropometric parameters [body mass index (BMI), tricipital skin fold thickness (TF), and muscular arm circumference (MAC), using the rating scheme: undernourished (U): percentile (pc) &lt; 15; normal (N): pc &gt; 15 to pc &lt; 85; obese (O): pc &gt; 85], and urea kinetics (protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance) [PNA = PCR according to the Gotch-Borah (G), Blumenkrantz (B), and Randerson (R) formulas]. Nitrogen-balance [N-B = DPI(N)-PNA(N)], metabolic ratio (MR = DPI\/PNA), and metabolic index (MI = IDPI\/nPNA) were calculated as metabolic indicators. There were 215 evaluations (B24 h) in 44 patients, of whom 29 were male and 15 female, 35 on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (PD), 9 on automated PD, age 58.2 +\/- 15.6 years, followed-up for 15.3 +\/- 10.2 months. Undernourished patients (BMI) showed higher N-B, MR, and MI irrespective of the formula used, but MR was only significant using the Blumenkrantz formula. For N-balance and metabolic index, analysis of variance (ANOVA) was significant with all formulas. The mean metabolic index (Randerson) in subgroups was: U: 1.09 +\/- 0.27, n = 54; N: 0.90 +\/- 0.25, n = 135; O: 0.87 +\/- 0.27, n = 26 (ANOVA: P &lt; 0.0001). The U-N and U-O subgroup comparison was significant (Newman-Keuls P &lt; 0.01). We concluded that: (1) The metabolic index is more discriminating for protein metabolism than N-balance or metabolic ratio. (2) Most of the undernourished patients (BMI) are anabolic according to metabolic index and N-balance, and this indicates recovery. (3) Undernourished (low BMI) patients with metabolic index &lt; 1 deserve special attention due to the risk of remaining malnourished.","730":"Continuous ambulatory (CAPD) and continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) differ in solute transport, and variances in mass balance could impact nutritional parameters. Chronic acidosis may decrease albumin synthesis and increase catabolism. We prospectively studied 50 peritoneal dialysis patients (age: 55 +\/- 16 yrs; CAPD = 33; CCPD = 17) over 24 months. Acidosis was defined by an anion gap &gt; 18 mEq\/L. Bioimpedance analysis was used to estimate body cell mass and fat-free mass. Patients on CAPD had a lower body mass index than CCPD patients (27 +\/- 5 kg\/m2 vs. 29 +\/- 9 kg\/m2 respectively; P = 0.039). However no differences were observed in body cell mass (25 +\/- 8 kg vs. 26 +\/- 9 kg respectively; P = 0.787) or fat-free mass (53 +\/- 14 kg vs. 50 +\/- 18 kg respectively; P = 0.404). Urea kinetic modeling showed no differences in Kpt\/V or nPCR (0.26 +\/- 0.06 vs. 0.24 +\/- 0.07; P = 0.709 and 0.67 +\/- 0.29 g\/kg per day vs. 0.65 +\/- 0.23 g\/kg per day; P = 0.709 for CAPD and CCPD respectively). When categorized by the presence of acidosis no differences were observed in body cell mass (24 +\/- 8 kg vs. 27 +\/- 9 kg respectively; P = 0.131) or fat-free mass (54 +\/- 15 kg vs. 50 +\/- 16 kg respectively; P = 0.348), while body mass index was greater in acidotic than nonacidotic individuals (30 +\/- 8 kg\/m2 vs. 26 +\/- 6 kg\/m2 respectively; P = 0.005). Dietary protein intake assessed as nPCR was similar in both groups (0.64 +\/- 0.26 vs. 0.71 +\/- 0.28 g\/kg per day; P = 0.319, for CAPD and CCPD respectively). We conclude that over a 24-month period neither peritoneal dialysis modality nor the presence of acidosis has a detrimental influence on nutritional parameters in well dialyzed patients.","731":"Diabetes mellitus is the fastest growing cause of end-stage renal disease and an important source of comorbidity among renal patients. A better understanding of diabetic pathophysiology has contributed to the development of effective prevention or treatment of many of its complications. The systematic application of several therapeutic recommendations based on clinical evidence can significantly reduce the rate of diabetic complications and improve the quality of life of the diabetic patient. Some of the most important recommendations are: (1) meticulous glycemic control to maintain HbA1c &lt; or = 7.2%; (2) control of arterial blood pressure to normal levels (&lt; 130\/85 mmHg); (3) tobacco abstinence; (4) avoidance of excessive protein intake in the early stages of nephropathy; (5) aggressive nutritional monitoring and support; (6) early myocardial revascularization; (7) avoidance of unnecessary use of radiographic contrast media; and (8) appropriate initiation of dialysis with adequate delivered dose. Every effort should be made to provide effective education of the patient and health professionals. We must also develop regimens that interfere minimally with lifestyles in order to improve patient compliance with therapy.","732":"There are indications that advanced glycosylation end-products (AGEs) may affect in some manner the functions of the peritoneum. Only a few reports discuss the actual generation of glycosylated proteins and the intraperitoneal kinetics involved during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). To demonstrate the formation of AGEs and their time-courses in peritoneal dialysis (PD) effluents, measurements were made of furosine, carboxymethyl lysine (CML), and pentosidine as glycosylation markers in vitro and in vivo using PD effluents obtained every 2 hours for up to 8 hours from 3 nondiabetic CAPD patients. Furosine and CML were found to be generated relatively early (within 6 hours), and their de novo formation was markedly enhanced subsequent to glucose addition. Furosine and CML production increased in proportion to glucose concentration. Pentosidine production did not change with time for up to 24 hours, and was not induced by glucose during this period. Carboxymethyl lysine production appeared to be suppressed in vitro with the addition of serum protein. Furosine in the intraperitoneal dialysate was initially the same as that in the plasma, but increased to twice as much in just 2 hours in vivo. Production of CML increased, but apparently was suppressed with leakage of plasma protein into the dialysate; this possibly may have been due to dilutional or antiglycation effects in the plasma. No stimulation of pentosidine production could be detected in the intraperitoneal dialysate even at 8 hours. The initiation of glycosylation of peritoneal proteins, with generation of furosine and CML but not pentosidine, is clearly shown by the present results to occur relatively early in the intraperitoneal dialysate, i.e., within a matter of hours.","733":"Peritoneal advanced glycation end-product (AGE) formation may be accelerated by glucose degradation products produced as a consequence of heat sterilization of peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluid. The formation of these degradation products is reduced if the glucose is separated from the buffers during heat sterilization. This pilot study compared in vitro AGE formation in PD fluid (1.36% and 3.86% glucose) heat sterilized in a two-compartment bag (bicarbonate\/lactate buffer) with that in a standard, single-compartment bag (lactate buffer, Dianeal). Peritoneal dialysis fluids were incubated with human serum albumin (HSA, 1 g\/L), as a model protein, at 37 degrees C for 0, 5, and 20 days. Formation of AGEs was assessed by measuring fluorescence at each time point. Advanced glycation end-product formation was greater in lactate PD fluid compared with bicarbonate\/lactate PD fluid of equivalent glucose strength. Advanced glycation end-product formation in the lactate PD fluid containing 1.36% glucose was comparable to that in the bicarbonate\/lactate PD fluid containing 3.86% glucose. The rate of increase in fluorescence per day was greater in the first 5 days of incubation than in the subsequent 15 days. These results are compatible with the presence of greater amounts of glucose-degradation products in the standard single-compartment bag resulting in enhanced AGE formation.","734":"Hyperparathyroidism (HPT) is a common finding in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Most chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) patients with HTP can be successfully managed with phosphate binders, calcium supplements, and calcitriol therapy. Noncompliance with diet, prescribed binder, or calcitriol therapy may also lead to HPT. We reviewed New Haven CAPD unit patients who failed medical therapy and required parathyroidectomy (PTX) for control of severe HPT [sustained immunoreactive parathyroid hormone (iPTH) level &gt; 600 pg\/mL]. From 1990 to 1997, 18 out of 620 patients (3.0%) required PTX. Time on dialysis prior to PTX was 44.8 +\/- 17.5 (mean +\/- SD) months with a range of 13 to 71 months. The mean age was 43.6 +\/- 11.8 years with a range of 30 to 66 years. There were 10 females and 8 males. Of the 18 patients, 14 had total parathyroidectomy with arm implants, and 4 had subtotal PTX. Seven of 18 patients had iPTH levels of &lt; 100 pg\/mL at 1 year post-PTX (5 patients with arm implants, 2 with subtotal PTX). Three patients required partial arm implant PTX to correct recurrent HPT. Pulse oral calcitriol (POC) was prescribed in 10 patients post PTX to maintain iPTH at target levels. Parathyroidectomy was necessary to correct HPT in 18 of 620 CPD patients from 1990 to 1997. The majority of these patients had excellent results after their PTX. Intact PTH levels of &lt; 100 pg\/mL for 1 year or more were noted in 5 of 14 patients with arm implants, and 2 of 4 patients with subtotal PTX. The significance of a persistent iPTH of &lt; 100 pg\/mL has yet to be determined in CPD patients.","735":"One of the classic histologic forms of renal osteodystrophy is osteitis fibrosa, and its distinguishing characteristic is bone marrow (BM) fibrosis, caused by the activation of marrow parenchymal cells. A bone biopsy must be performed in order to establish the diagnosis of renal osteodystrophy. The clinical use of bone biopsy is restricted, however, due to the invasiveness of the procedure. In recent studies, bone scans have provided information useful for the differential diagnosis between osteomalacia and osteitis fibrosa. However, bone scans can not provide information on the bone marrow status. Bone marrow immunoscintigraphy (BMIS) using Tc-99m anti-granulocyte antibody (AGA), a highly sensitive test for the detection of bone marrow abnormalities which is also a noninvasive method, has rarely been reported in chronic renal failure (CRF). BMIS can provide information in patients with myelofibrosis. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the usefulness of BMIS in CRF patients with special regards to biochemical parameters. Nineteen CRF patients (13 men, 6 women; mean age: 48 +\/- 11 years) in whom bone scintigraphy using Tc-99m MDP (methylene diphosphonate) showed the so-called superscan pattern were included in the study. Their primary renal diseases were chronic glomerulonephritis (n = 14), diabetes (n = 4), and polycystic kidney disease (n = 1). Modes of therapies were continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (n = 13; mean duration: 9.5 months), HD (n = 5; mean duration: 7.8 months), and conservative treatment (n = 1). BMIS using Tc-99m labeled anti-granulocyte monoclonal mouse antibody BW250\/183 was performed, and the results were compared with the biochemical parameters of the patients. According to the presence of BM expansion, which may represent marrow fibrosis, the 19 patients were divided into two groups: Group I (n = 7) with BM expansion and Group II (n = 12) with normal marrow distribution. The biochemical parameters and bone markers of Group I were compared with those of Group II. There was no significant difference in biochemical parameters (blood hemoglobin, serum ferritin, erythropoietin, BUN, creatinine) between the two groups. There were no significants difference in serum calcium, phosphorus, tartate-resistant acid phosphatase (TRAP), and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) between the two groups. Serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) and osteocalcin were significantly (P &lt; 0.05) higher in Group I than in Group II. These results suggest that patients with bone marrow expansion in BMIS have increased levels of ALP and osteocalcin, indicating an increased osteoblastic activity. BMIS may be useful for the detection of bone marrow expansion due to marrow fibrosis in renal osteodystrophy, and for the evaluation of the extent of bone marrow fibrosis.","736":"The aim of this study was to determine whether nitric oxide (NO) production is altered during peritonitis in patients receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and if so, whether there is an association between this alteration and the severity and prognosis of CAPD-induced peritonitis. The study population comprised 30 patients with 30 episodes of peritonitis. Thirteen patients without peritonitis were used as CAPD-control, and eighteen patients with normal renal function were used as normal-control. Total NO metabolites (NOx; nitrite + nitrate) were measured by the Griess method to reflect nitric oxide production. Peritoneal dialysate effluent and plasma were collected from 30 patients during episodes of peritonitis every day for the first 3 days, and then every 3 days for 2 weeks or until the patients were discharged. Plasma NOx levels in the control, CAPD-control, and CAPD-peritonitis groups were 87.0 +\/- 11.5, 163.0 +\/- 30.7 and 146.3 +\/- 18.1 microM, respectively. Dialysate NOx levels in the CAPD-control and CAPD-peritonitis groups were 91.8 +\/- 13.1 and 103.8 +\/- 14.1 microM, respectively, and dialysate NOx levels did not differ between the two groups. The peak dialysate\/plasma (D\/P) ratios during the acute phase exceeded 1.0 in 46.7% of the patients of the CAPD-peritonitis group. The D\/P ratios of NOx levels before and after treatment were 1.03 +\/- 0.07 and 0.56 +\/- 0.05, respectively. On the contrary, NOx levels in dialysate after treatment were not decreased, but those in plasma were increased after effective treatment. The peak D\/P ratio increased 2.1-fold in the bacterial peritonitis group and 2.3-fold in the fungal peritonitis group, compared with the CAPD-control group. The lowest D\/P ratios after treatment were similar to those in the CAPD-control group in patients with effective treatment, but remained 1.5-fold higher in patients for whom treatment was ineffective. In the evolutional study, the D\/P ratios of NOx levels gradually declined to CAPD-control group levels (6.6 +\/- 2.5 days) after effective antibiotic treatment, but it took longer for leukocyte counts in the peritoneal dialysate effluents (3.8 +\/- 1.2 days) to normalize. In 5 patients with refractory peritonitis (Candida infection in three, Staphylococcus aureus infection in two), the D\/P ratios of NOx levels remained elevated by 1.5-fold despite treatment, and the catheters were removed. These results suggest that dialysate NOx may be influenced not only by local NO production, but also by plasma NO or NOx diffusion. Therefore, we can suppose that the D\/P ratio of NOx levels provides more clinical significance than dialysate NOx levels only. In conclusion, the D\/P ratios of NOx levels may serve as a marker to assess the severity of peritoneal inflammation, treatment efficacy, and progression of refractory peritonitis in CAPD patients with peritonitis.","737":"The lack of specific information on the peritoneal-function consequences of late peritonitis episodes, and the concern about long-term consequences of peritoneal dialysis (PD), have prompted us to study the peritoneal function of long-term PD patients after a late peritonitis episode. The question is: Is the peritoneum more vulnerable to infections, in terms of functional effects, after a long time on PD? Forty-nine patients observed from baseline to the first year of PD with no peritonitis constituted the \"early\" control group; 31 other patients had one episode of peritonitis in the same period. Twenty-seven patients with no peritonitis from the fourth to fifth years comprised the \"late\" control group; 15 other patients had one episode during the same period. The results presented here suggest that peritoneal vulnerability to infectious episodes depends on the PD stage in which they appeared. Certainly, episodes with similar aggressive capacity in terms of inflammation duration (3-4 days) happening during the fifth year led to a loss of ultrafiltration (UF) capacity that does not appear in patients who suffer an episode during the first PD year. A remarkable feature is that this UF-capacity decrease is not accompanied by the usual creatinine mass transfer coefficient increase. This fact suggests that the dependence between peritoneal-glucose-gradient maintenance and water transport has been partially modified over time on PD. In conclusion, late mild peritonitis has distinct peritoneal-function consequences relative to early peritonitis. Patients who continue PD after one late episode showed an accentuation of the usual change which happens on long-term PD, the loss of peritoneal ultrafiltration capacity.","738":"The recruitment of immunocompetent cells to the site of inflammation represents an essential part of the host defense during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)-related peritonitis. Recently, it was shown that intraperitoneal application of granulocyte macrophage-colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF) leads to a marked transient recruitment of macrophages, paralleled by an increase in monocyte chemoattractant protein (MCP)-1. We, therefore, tested the in vitro effect of GM-CSF on the release of the chemotaxins interleukin (IL)-8 and MCP-1 by human peritoneal macrophages. Cells were stimulated with recombinant GM-CSF for 4, 12, and 20 hours in concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 100 pg\/mL. Cells stimulated with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or unstimulated cells served as control. Recombinant GM-CSF at concentrations found during CAPD peritonitis in vivo significantly increased the release of IL-8 and MCP-1 in a time- and dose-dependent manner. The maximum effect of IL-8 was observed directly after cell isolation, and decreased after a culture period of 10 days. Thus, our results indicate that peritoneal macrophages are the potential source of chemokines released upon GM-CSF stimulation.","739":"Sphingolipids are emerging as important regulators of mammalian cell biology. In this study, the contents of six separate preparations of human omental mesothelial cells in vitro were examined for free sphingosine and sphinganine, and for the total levels of these sphingoid bases in ceramide-containing sphingolipids. Two high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) methods for determination of sphingoid base levels in cultured cells were compared. The rapid-HPLC method was found to yield the highest recovery of internal standard. Mesothelial cells initially isolated by collagenase digestion of the omentum were found to have higher free- and total-sphingoid base levels than cells isolated by trypsin-EDTA digestion. Use of sphingoid base levels to gain insights into the status of cellular nutrition, inflammation, programmed cell death, exposure to microbial toxins, cytokines, and growth factors within the peritoneum will require a systematic description of sphingolipids in normal, diseased, and dialyzed mesothelium.","740":"In this study, a third-generation cephalosporin with proposed immunomodulatory properties, cefodizime, was investigated to see if it has any effect on the chemotactic activity of human peritoneal monocyte and polymorphonuclear cell populations ex vivo. Ten continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients with peritonitis were entered in the study. Monocytes and polymorphonuclear cells were isolated from the patients' peritoneal effluent prior to initiation of any antibiotic therapy. Chemotaxis was measured by the Boyden chamber method before and after 2-hour incubation with cefodizime (200 mg\/2L). Following 2-hour incubation with 200 mg\/2L cefodizime, monocyte chemotaxis was increased from 36.8 +\/- 5.6 microns to 50.2 +\/- 6.6 microns (P = 0.0005). A similar increase was observed in polymorphonuclear cells from 42.0 +\/- 8.8 microns to 48.7 +\/- 10.3 microns (P = 0.02). We conclude that cefodizime acts as a priming agent on peritoneal polymorphonuclear cells, particularly on monocytes, and increases their chemotactic movements.","741":"Microbiological data have been collected on the performance of a new method of isolating and disinfecting the intraluminal path at the connect\/disconnect site of a peritoneal dialysis (PD)-exchange pathway. High-temperature moist-heat (HTMH) disinfection is accomplished by a new device that uses microwave energy to heat the solution contained in the pressure-tight inner lumen of PD connector pairs between the transfer-set connector-clamp and the bag-connector break-away seal. An 85 degrees C (S.D. = 2.4 degrees C, n = 10) rise in solution temperature is seen in 12 seconds, thus yielding temperatures under pressure well over 100 degrees C with starting temperatures of 25 degrees C. Connector pairs were prepared by inoculation of a solution suspension containing at least 10(6) colony-forming units (CFU) of a test micro-organism. Approximately 0.4 mL of solution was contained within the mated connector pair. Using standard D-value determination methods, data were obtained for surviving organisms versus five exposure times and a positive control to obtain a population reduction curve. Four micro-organisms (S. epidermidis, P. aeruginosa, C. albicans, and A. niger) recognized to be among the most prevalent or problematic in causing peritonitis were tested. After microwave heating, the treated solution was aseptically withdrawn from the connector pair using a needle and syringe, plated in growth media, and incubated. Population counts of CFUs after incubation were used to establish survival curves. Results showed a tenfold population reduction in less than 3 seconds for all organisms tested. A 30-second cycle time safely achieves a &gt; 10(8) population-reduction for bacteria and yeast organisms, and a &gt; 10(7) population reduction for fungi. One potential benefit of using this new intraluminal disinfection method is that it may help reduce peritonitis resulting from the even more problematic pathogens such as the gram-negative bacteria and fungal organisms.","742":"Due to discrepant definitions of exit-site infections and\/or tunnel infections (ESI\/TI), as well as to the variety of infection rates, data on ESI\/TI are extremely difficult to compare. Twardwski et al. have defined exit site, while Nolph et al. have proposed new monitoring and reporting of ESI\/TI. The aim of our prospective study was to try combining both systems. From January 1992 to December 1995 we treated 127 patients, in whom 147 double-cuff peritoneal catheters (PCs) were inserted. Tunnel infection was defined as external-cuff infection (ECI), inter-cuff segment infection (ICSI), and\/or internal-cuff infection (ICI). Sixty-four PCs (43.5%) were infected. Thirty-eight (25.8%) had acute PC infection (PCI) from 2.4% to 4.7% of the total patient-months of care per year, and 26 (17.7%) PCs were chronically infected from 2.1 to 11.1% of the time per year. Almost all cases of removed acutely and chronically infected PCs had ECI in combination with ESI. According to our experience, ECI should be classified as TI. The proposed approach to monitoring and reporting is very useful for ESI, but does not include TI. Comparison between different peritoneal dialysis units is only possible when they share a common PC classification system, and when their personnel are well experienced, highly trained, and very accurate.","743":"The goal of this study was to compare the safety and efficacy of Amuchina 50% solution versus that of povidone-iodine 10% solution for transfer-set change in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients in a tertiary referral university hospital. The transfer sets were changed using povidone-iodine 10% solution as disinfectant prior to March 1995. Thereafter Amuchina 50% solution was used. Thus data were collected on all the transfer sets changed between January 1993 and August 1997. Amuchina is an electrolytic chloroxidizer. Chlorine is the active ingredient with a pH of 9.5-10.5. Amuchina 50% solution contains chlorine (0.55%). One hundred ninety-nine transfer sets were changed using povidone-iodine 10% solution in 60 PD patients from January 1993 to March 1995. One hundred twenty-eight transfer sets were changed using Amuchina 50% solution in 65 patients from April 1995 to August 1997. The soaking times and nursing times were 2 and 5 minutes, respectively, with Amuchina, and 10 and 20 minutes, respectively, with povidone-iodine 10%. No episode of peritonitis occurred related to transfer-set change in either group. The transfer-set change using Amuchina 50% solution is safe and cost-effective in PD patients.","744":"An increasing number of patients are prescribed a continuous-cycling regimen because standard manual peritoneal-dialysis exchanges alone are not sufficient in achieving adequate dialysis as defined by the Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative. Consequently, the number of patients on continuous-cycler therapy is increasing. There is controversy as to whether there are differences in the development of peritonitis between patients maintained on manual therapy and those on continuous cycling therapy. As a result, we retrospectively reviewed the charts of all cycler peritoneal dialysis (CPD) patients maintained on either manual peritoneal dialysis (Baxter UltraBag; Group I) or continuous cycler peritoneal dialysis (Baxter HomeChoice Cycler; Group II) between 1 June 1994 and 31 December 1996. A total of 239 patients were in Group I and 106 in Group II. Both groups were similar in age, race, gender, and presence of diabetes mellitus, coronary artery disease, peripheral vascular disease, and gastrointestinal disease. There was no difference in the overall rate of peritonitis between the two groups of patients [1 episode in 10.4 patient-months (Group I) vs. 1 in 10.0 patient-months (Group II); -0.01843 to 0.02619]. The rates of Staphylococcus aureus peritonitis [1 episode in 48.5 patient-months (Group I) vs. 1 in 141.8 patient months (Group II); -0.06152 to -1.1689]; polymicrobial peritonitis [1 episode in 278.8 patient-months (Group I) vs. 1 in 1134 patient months (Group II): -0.0079 to -0.0478], and fungal peritonitis (1 episode in 202.7 patient-months (Group I) vs. no episodes (Group II); 0.00202 to 0.00785] were significantly lower among patients maintained on the Baxter HomeChoice Cycler. The rate of gram-negative peritonitis was higher among patients maintained on the Baxter HomeChoice Cycler, but this difference was not statistically significant [1 episode in 82.6 patient-months (Group I) vs. 1 episode in 45.4 patient months (Group II); 0.4723 to -0.0248]. We conclude that individual rates of peritonitis were different for patients maintained on either manual or continuous CPD therapy, while the overall rate of peritonitis was found to be similar for both groups of patients. The finding that there may be a difference with the gram-negative peritonitis rate is important since gram-negative peritonitis has been shown to have a more severe outcome in terms of morbidity, mortality, and patient dropout from CPD therapy. A larger, randomized, multicenter study comparing the rates of gram-positive, gram-negative, fungal, and polymicrobial peritonitis is warranted.","745":"The management of peritonitis in patients undergoing automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) deserves special consideration due to the technical differences between APD modalities and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The use of very short exchanges may preclude the prompt diagnosis of peritonitis by diluting the peritoneal-cell population and causing spuriously low cell counts and clear effluent. Very long diurnal cycles can have the opposite result and give a falsely elevated cell count. The effluent from the multiple automated exchanges must be visually examined before being discarded in order to make a prompt diagnosis. Direct drainage of effluent into the sewage without inspection should be avoided. If direct drainage becomes a common practice, other alternatives such as on-line cell counters or chemical detectors of possible infection will be necessary. The recommendations for antimicrobial therapy developed for CAPD apply as well to APD. If single-day dosage is to be used, the longer exchanges of APD are ideal for intra-peritoneal delivery of antibiotics.","746":"Many patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) require admission to an extended-care facility (ECF). Few data are available concerning the development of peritonitis among continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD) patients residing in an ECF. We retrospectively reviewed the charts of 77 CPD patients admitted to an ECF between November 1993 and 31 August 1997. A total of 25 episodes of peritonitis developed among CPD patients in the ECF during this period for an overall peritonitis rate of 1 episode in 19.8 patient-months. The CPD patients developing peritonitis in the ECF were similar in age and gender to the CPD patients residing in the ECF not developing peritonitis. There were more African-Americans among the group of CPD patients residing in the ECF who developed peritonitis than among the ECF residents who did not develop peritonitis (41% vs. 23%, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). Patients developing peritonitis in the ECF resided in the ECF significantly longer than the remaining CPD patients not developing peritonitis in the ECF (106 vs. 77 days, respectively; P &lt; 0.05). The overall rate of peritonitis in the ECF was lower than that seen in the community (1 episode in 19.8 patient-months vs. 1 episode in 10.0 patient-months, respectively). The rate of gram-positive peritonitis was lower than the rate of gram-positive peritonitis seen in the community setting (1 episode in 54.9 patient-months vs. 1 episode in 14.9 patient-months, respectively). The rate of culture-negative peritonitis was higher among the ECF patients than among patients developing community-acquired peritonitis (1 episode in 61.9 patient-months vs. 1 episode in 106.2 patient-months, respectively). The spectrum of organisms in the ECF was different than the spectrum noted among patients developing hospital-acquired peritonitis. Eleven of the 25 episodes of peritonitis were treated successfully at the ECF while the remaining 14 episodes of peritonitis were treated at an acute-care hospital. Continuous PD therapy was continued following 19 of the 25 episodes (76%), 1 patient transferred to hemodialysis, and 5 patients expired. We conclude that patients develop peritonitis in the ECF less frequently than in the community setting, with the spectrum of organisms different than the spectrum seen in the community and hospital settings. Seventy-six percent of the patients continue CPD therapy following an episode of peritonitis.","747":"The presence of mixed disaccharides (maltose and isomaltose) in plasma from uremic patients has been previously investigated using gel-permeation chromatography. However, this method is unable to separate maltose (linked alpha-1-4) from isomaltose (linked alpha-1-6). We describe an alternative method using high-performance anion-exchange chromatography with pulsed amperometric detection (HPAE-PAD) for the direct determination of maltose and isomaltose in uremic plasma. We measured maltose and isomaltose using HPAE-PAD in 6 normal subjects and in 15 uremic patients before and after once-daily icodextrin administration for at least 4 weeks. Both maltose and isomaltose were below limits of detection (&lt; 1.0 mg\/L) in plasma from normal controls. Patients with end-stage renal disease treated by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis had elevated levels of isomaltose (23.6 +\/- 8.3 mg\/L) but low levels of maltose (&lt; 3.0 mg\/L). Treatment with icodextrin resulted in elevated plasma levels of maltose (range: 500-1600 mg\/L), while levels of isomaltose declined to 9.8 +\/- 5.2 mg\/L (P &lt; 0.0001 vs. baseline levels). We conclude that isomaltose (not maltose) is the primary disaccharide isomer that is elevated in the plasma of uremic patients, whereas maltose is the primary disaccharide isomer that is elevated following icodextrin administration. Furthermore, icodextrin administration results in an apparent reduction of isomaltose. Additional investigation will be required to address the mechanism for the reduction of isomaltose in patients treated by icodextrin.","748":"Existing peritoneal dialysis (PD) solutions were formulated mainly for the maintenance of fluid and electrolyte balance, correction of metabolic acidosis, and the removal of metabolic waste products. New solutions in development, and recently approved in some countries, are designed to improve ultrafiltration during long dwells (polyglucose or icodextrin solutions), to treat malnutrition (amino-acids solutions), and to improve peritoneal biocompatibility (bicarbonate-buffered solutions). Other new solutions under investigation are designed to address unmet clinical needs, including cardiovascular disease and sodium balance, through the use of a low-sodium PD solution; long-term peritoneal viability, through improvements in sterilization processes and the use of nonglucose osmotic agents; and PD adequacy, through the use of solution additives (such as glycosaminoglycans) and tailored PD prescriptions using APD. Future concepts for PD include remodeling of the peritoneum, perhaps using mesothelial gene therapy to introduce metabolic and anabolic machinery to remove or perpetually recycle metabolic wastes.","749":"The administration of intraperitoneal (i.p.) heparin enjoys time-honored use and is felt to be side-effect free. It is administered whenever fibrin is detected in the dialysate effluent. It is believed that there is no absorption of heparin across the peritoneal cavity. The aim of this article was to review the rationale behind the administration of i.p. heparin, to show that absorption and side effects may occur, and to present recent evidence that questions the routine use of this drug as an additive to dialysate fluid.","750":"Many patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) are overhydrated. We investigated whether hypertension in PD patients is related to ultrafiltration-failure-induced fluid retention. Twenty-four-hour blood pressure measurements were performed in 10 normotensive and 9 hypertensive PD patients, aged 20 to 77 years, and treated with PD for 2 to 125 months. Antihypertensive medication had been discontinued for 3 weeks. Twenty-four-hour blood pressure was monitored with a Spacelabs 90207. Mean 24-hour systolic, mean, and diastolic pressure were calculated, together with the nighttime (23:00-07:00)\/daytime (07:00-23:00) ratio. Ultrafiltration was determined separately during a standardized 4-hour peritoneal permeability analysis (SPA) with 1.36% glucose. Based on the SPA, patients were divided into a group with negative net ultrafiltration (NUF) and a group with positive net ultrafiltration (PUF). In 8 patients with NUF, systolic, mean, and diastolic pressures were 142 +\/- 16 mmHg, 110 +\/- 14 mmHg, and 95 +\/- 13 mmHg, compared to 135 +\/- 22 (ns), 99 +\/- 14 (ns), and 81 +\/- 11 (P &lt; 0.05) in 11 patients with PUF. Net ultrafiltration during the test dwell correlated negatively with diastolic blood pressure (r = -0.53, P &lt; 0.05). Diurnal blood pressure variations were not related to ultrafiltration capacity. In conclusion, hypertension in PD patients may in part be explained by fluid retention caused by impaired ultrafiltration.","751":"Large exchange volumes of 2.5 and 3 L are frequently necessary to improve clearances to the level suggested by the DOQI guidelines. However, abdominal wall hernias are a well known complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD) related to increased abdominal pressure, and might increase with higher exchange volumes. We studied the effect of using higher exchange volumes in PD patients on the incidence of hernia formation. Seventy-nine (12%) of 656 PD patients over a 15-year span developed abdominal wall hernias. Eleven percent of patients using 2 L or smaller volumes, 15% of patients using more than 2 L but less than 3 L, and 13% of patients using 3 L developed hernias (not significantly different). Five percent of patients on cyclers for their entire PD experience (3 of 63 patients) developed one or more hernias, compared to 13% of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for at least part of their experience (P = 0.06). The use of larger volumes increased dramatically over time; only 11% of patients used more than 2-L exchange volumes during the years 1982 through 1986, compared to 73% in the period from 1992 to 1997. We conclude that increased volumes in PD patients do not lead to an increased risk of hernia formation. Exchange volumes can be increased as needed to improve clearances.","752":"A retrospective case control study was performed on a cohort of 244 peritoneal dialysis patients followed over 5 years to determine whether dialysate fill-volume was associated with hernia development. The laboratory and clinical parameters of patients who developed hernias during this time period were compared with those of patients who did not develop hernias. Information on 27 patients who developed hernias was compared with that on 217 patients who did not develop hernias. Dialysate fill-volume was similar between groups (2.2 +\/- .3 L for patients with hernias vs. 2.2 +\/- .3 L for controls). Three patients with fill-volumes of 1.5 L developed hernias, and no patients with fill-volumes of 3 L developed hernias. Age, duration of time on dialysis, and body surface area were also similar between groups. This investigation could not find a relationship between fill-volume and hernia formation. From this study it would appear that physicians should not hesitate to increase fill-volume based on concerns of hernia development.","753":"Upper gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms are frequently observed in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. We conducted esophageal manometry and 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring in 4 CAPD patients (Group I) who had upper GI symptoms such as nausea and vomiting and compared them with 9 patients (Group II) who did not. The mean age in Group I was 48.5 +\/- 13.7 years, and the male-to-female ratio was 1:3. One patient was diabetic. There were no significant differences in clinical and biochemical data between the two groups. Comparing the results of esophageal manometry, supine lower esophageal sphincter pressure (LESP) at 2000 mL of infused dialysate was significantly lower in Group I than in Group II (23.2 +\/- 4.4 vs 31.2 7.1 mmHg, P &lt; 0.05), but supine LESPs at empty state and sitting LESPs were not different. Group I had a significantly higher total number of reflux episodes (89.0 +\/- 16.5 vs 26.5 +\/- 19.4, P &lt; 0.05), number of reflux episodes longer than 5 minutes (2.3 +\/- 2.6 vs 0.3 +\/- 0.5, P &lt; 0.05), total time of pH &lt; 4.0 (75.5 +\/- 55.5 vs 11.0 +\/- 6.8, P &lt; 0.05), and total reflux score (19.7 +\/- 10.2 vs 4.2 +\/- 2.3, P &lt; 0.05) in 24-hour esophageal pH monitoring. Three of 4 Group I patients met the criteria for abnormal gastroesophageal reflux set by the DeMeester scoring system. CAPD patients with upper GI symptoms such as nausea, vomiting, and epigastric discomfort should be evaluated for gastroesophageal reflux disease with esophageal manometry and pH monitoring.","754":"Patients with intra-abdominal vascular catastrophes may develop acute and\/or chronic renal failure requiring dialysis. To patients with in-situ vascular prostheses the use of peritoneal dialysis (PD) may offer considerable advantages including better hemodynamic control and avoidance of anti-coagulation in a critically ill patient. Institution of PD in such patients, however, often gives rise to concerns relating to peritonitis and subsequent infection of the prosthesis, fluid leaks, and abdominal wound dehiscence. A review of available literature suggests that PD has been utilized in both acute and chronic renal failure following intra-abdominal vascular procedures. PD appears to be an efficient mode of dialysis with a surprisingly small number of complications in these patients.","755":"Data on the outcomes of patients who are transferred between hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) are scant. This study analyzes data on patients transferred from their initial modality at the University Hospital Gent between 1978 and 1996 for the reasons for, and outcomes from, the transfer. The reasons for the transfer from HD to PD (n = 35) were access problems (25%), cardiovascular (40%) and blood pressure problems (25%), and personal choice (10%). For the transfer from PD to HD (n = 32) peritonitis (50%), social problems (14%), adequacy or ultrafiltration problems (25%), and leakage (11%) were the reasons. There were no differences in survivals between patients who started on HD and who were transferred to PD, and those who remained on HD (P = 0.4). There were improved survivals for the patients who started on PD and who were transferred to HD compared to those remaining on PD (P = 0.01). It is concluded that transferring problematic HD patients to PD does not improve their survivals, whereas the survival of patients with PD-related complications is improved by transferring them to HD. This is due to the differences in the reasons for transfer, which are PD-related complications in the case of PD patients, and cardiovascular problems in the case of HD patients.","756":null,"757":"Videolaparoscopic techniques are an increasingly used modality for peritoneal dialysis catheter implant and rescue procedures. The greatest impediment for acceptance of the laparoscopic approach has been the necessity of general anesthesia because peritoneal insufflation of CO2 gas produces pain. In addition, complications of CO2 pneumoperitoneum include hypercarbia, acidosis, and cardiac arrhythmias. Renal failure patients commonly have severe coexisting medical conditions that make them an unacceptable risk for both general anesthesia and CO2 peritoneal insufflation. From December 1996 through November 1997, laparoscopy was performed utilizing nitrous oxide (N2O) as the insufflation gas. Since N2O produces neither pain nor metabolic effects, the laparoscopic procedure was safely performed under local anesthesia. Thirty-one patients have had laparoscopic implantation of peritoneal dialysis catheters under local anesthesia with 22 procedures performed on an ambulatory basis. The remaining cases were already hospitalized for complications of their renal failure. Four laparoscopic rescue procedures for catheter dysfunction were performed under local anesthesia with 3 cases as outpatients. Surgical laparoscopy under local anesthesia with N2O insufflation is a safe approach for both implantation procedures and salvaging of malfunctioning catheters. The procedure can be performed on an outpatient basis, frequently without delay in initiation or interruption of peritoneal dialysis.","758":"Laparoscopic surgery has been gaining in popularity. Prior to 1995, whenever our patients had a laparoscopic procedure it was carried out with the standard precautions, and the patient stayed on peritoneal dialysis (PD). We noticed a high incidence (71.4%) of peritonitis post laparoscopic surgery. Four of the peritonitis patients had cholecystectomies and 1 had a gastrostomy for placement of a feeding tube laparoscopically. The patients' ages ranged from 31 to 74 years; 4 (80%) were females. They had been on PD for a mean of 24 months (range 6-48 months). Peritonitis was diagnosed within a mean of 22.2 hours (r: 12-36 h) post procedure. The causative organisms were Klebsiella in two cases, Staph. aureus in one, Pseudomonas in one, with no growth observed in one. Following this, we instituted a deliberate policy of temporary cessation of PD for 2 weeks post laparoscopic procedure, maintaining the patient on hemodialysis during this period. Since the adoption of this policy, we have had no peritonitis in 7 patients who have undergone laparoscopic procedures.","759":"The success of Tenckhoff chronic peritoneal dialysis catheters depends more upon the skill of the physician in placing catheters and on the technique of placement than it does on the exact design of the peritoneal catheter. In this summary article, the existing types of peritoneal catheters are reviewed, including two recent alternative designs: Tenckhoff catheters with larger internal diameters, and the T-fluted catheter with grooved limbs adjacent to the parietal peritoneum. The three types of placement procedures for catheters (peritoneoscopy, surgical or dissective, and blind techniques) are described, and the complications of Tenckhoff catheters are compared according to placement technique.","760":"Presently, adequate dialysis in continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD) patients is assessed by monitoring urea kinetics (Kt\/V) or by measuring the total creatinine clearance (CC). Target Dialysis Outcome Quality Initiative (DOQI) goals are a weekly Kt\/V of at least 2.0, and a CC of at least 60 L\/wk per 1.73 m2. One hundred and four CPD patients in the New Haven continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) unit had their most recent Kt\/V and CC reviewed. Of these patients, 58.7% attained the DOQI goals for Kt\/V and CC, 14.4% had an acceptable Kt\/V but low CC, 11.5% had an acceptable CC but low Kt\/V, and 15.4% had both low Kt\/V and low CC. A CC &gt; 60 L\/week per 1.73 m2 was associated with a residual renal function of &gt; 25 L\/wk per 1.73 m2. For a Kt\/V of &gt; 2.0, good residual renal function was helpful but not essential. A question left unanswered is whether patients with a low Kt\/V and an adequate CC or low CC and acceptable Kt\/V need more dialysis.","761":"The calculation of Kt\/V and creatinine clearance per 1.73 m2 of body surface area (CrCl\/1.73 m2 of BSA) varies according to whether the post- or pre-nightly dialysis treatment (NDT) values of the serum urea (sUrea), serum creatinine (sCreat), and body weight (BW) parameters are used. The purpose of this paper is to determine the difference between Kt\/V and CrCl\/1.73 m2 of BSA, calculated using the pre- and post-NDT values, and any correlation of such differences with different automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) methods. We took into consideration patients on APD treated using the tidal method with four different techniques: NTPD (9 patients; no daytime dwell), NTPD-1 (12 patients; one daytime dwell of 4-7 hours), CTPD (10 patients; one daytime dwell), and CTPD-2 (8 patients; two daytime dwells). Body water (V) and body surface area (BSA) were calculated using the Watson and Du Bois formulas. The percentage difference between pre- and post-NDT using the various methods is not statistically significant, while all the post-NDT parameters are significantly lower than the pre-NDT parameters. Since this difference is greater for sUrea (8.8%) and V (1.1%) than for sCreat (4.1%) and BSA (0.8%), the nightly Kt\/V variation (11.2%) is greater than the nightly CrCl\/1.73 m2 of BSA variation (5.2%). These variations do not differ significantly among the various methods. For APD, therefore, increase is to be expected in the CAPD targets of 10% and 5% respectively for Kt\/V and CrCl\/1.73 m2 of BSA calculated using the post-NDT values of sUrea and sCreat and the pre-NDT value of BW.","762":"NKF-DOQI guidelines suggest a Kt\/V value of 2.1 and a creatinine clearance (CRCL) value of 63 L\/1.73 m2 of body surface area per week as minimum targets in continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). Those targets are obtained by adapting the CAPD guidelines. The aim of our study was to verify the possibility of reaching the suggested targets with continuous tidal peritoneal dialysis (CTPD) and to check target modification in this automated treatment. Eight anuric patients underwent four consecutive CTPD sessions with increasing total prescribed volumes (17 L, 22 L, 27 L, and 32 L; night 9 h; fill 2.2 L; tidal 75%, day 2 dwells). The Kt\/V increase was significant (P = 0.012), unlike that of CRCL, with larger volumes. Two patients did not reach target Kt\/V, and four did not reach target CRCL. The volume normalized for 1.73 m2 corresponding to DOQI targets was 19.6 +\/- 2.6 L for Kt\/V and 20.2 +\/- 2.4 for CRCL. The overall Kt\/V was 2.29 +\/- 0.66 and CRCL was 57.3 +\/- 16.5 L\/1.73 m2. CRCL\/Kt\/V overall ratio was 25.6 +\/- 4.7 and significantly different from the target ratio (63\/2.1 = 30, P &lt; 0.001). The CRCL\/Kt\/V ratio showed a significant decrease with larger volumes (P = 0.001, linear trend P &lt; 0.001). Adequacy targets can be reached only in some patients on CTPD even with high dialysis volumes. The changes in the CRCL\/Kt\/V ratio in relation to dialysis volume can be considered for adaptation and evaluation of adequacy targets in automated treatments.","763":"In the treatment of uremia with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), the long-night dwell has always been a problem because of fluid retention. The purposes of the study were, firstly, to compare the solute clearance between five exchanges a day using standard CAPD, with a long-night dwell, to the clearance obtained with five exchanges a day using CAPD with the night-exchange device (NXD), in which case a more even distribution of the exchanges over 24 hours is obtained. A second aim of the study was to identify the best obtainable solute clearance: CAPD with the night-exchange device, or a cycler with a wet day. In the past year and a half, we have optimized solute clearance, using the PD Adequest program in 60 patients. The five-exchanges-a-day CAPD with the night-exchange device always gives a better solute clearance than standard CAPD with five exchanges a day and the long-night dwell. Solute clearance was always better with CAPD with NXD, except for Kt\/V in patients with high membrane transport, compared to cycler therapy with a wet day. High-dose cycler therapy with a wet day plus a midday exchange always gives a better solute clearance than CAPD with NXD.","764":"Inadequate dialysis dose is associated with poor patient-survival in peritoneal dialysis (PD). Most patients would require more than four exchanges a day after losing residual renal function. The use of automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) seems to be a practical way to provide extra dialysis for these patients. In our Dialysis Centre in Northern Alberta, we started to use APD for our adult patients only from 1993. When we evaluated our practice recently, we found that we are progressively increasing the use of APD (including cyclers and night exchange devices) from 3% to 21% for our total adult PD patients in the last 3 years. This increase in the use of APD is mostly to accommodate PD prescription changes and not changes in lifestyle. Increase in the use of APD was associated with decrease in the rate of our PD dropout to hemodialysis. We conclude that to maintain adequate dialysis, rapid growth of APD will become common in North American PD centers in the future and will reduce transfer to hemodialysis.","765":"The aim of this study was to characterize the morphological changes in the peritoneum following experimental peritoneal dialysis of rats, and to compare the new high-pH and low glucose-derived degradation products (GDP)-level PD fluid PD-Bio with the conventional PD fluid Gambrosol at two different exposure frequencies. Rats were subjected to 10 mL intraperitoneal injections three times per day at 3-hour intervals daytime for 9 days (2 successive weeks, excluding weekends) or once daily for 4 weeks. Untreated animals and animals exposed to Gambrosol or PD-Bio were compared. Biopsy samples were taken from the diaphragm and prepared for light microscopy. Morphometric analysis was used to compare the thickness and the cell density of the sub-mesothelial connective tissue. Intraperitoneal leukocyte numbers were counted. Both fluids induced a significant thickening of the submesothelial connective tissue and an increase in intraperitoneal leukocyte numbers. After exposure three times per day, Gambrosol induced a significantly greater submesothelial thickening than PD-Bio. The submesothelial tissue was more cell-dense after exposure to PD-Bio than after exposure to Gambrosol. The present results indicate that the structural changes of the peritoneum that follow peritoneal dialysis may be dependent upon the chemical composition of the PD fluids.","766":"Albumin has been evaluated as an osmotic agent for peritoneal dialysis as being physiologically safe and having modest colloidal osmotic pressure. However its extremely high cost inhibits clinical applications, and hypoalbuminemia is often seen in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, especially those with high peritoneal equilibration test (PET) values and who lose a large quantity of albumin everyday. This study aims at recovering protein from CAPD effluent and reusing it safely at reasonable cost as a substitute for dextrose. The dialysis effluent was collected and concentrated with a semipermeable membrane. Uremic toxins and low-molecular-weight solutes were removed by repeated filtration and water dilution. The concentrate was acidified with hydrochloric acid down to pH 2, thence de-acidified with water dialysis up to pH 5. At this point, the isoelectric point of albumin, at which precipitate was deposited, the precipitate was separated from the supernatant and re-dissolved into electrolyte solution. The acidified concentrate exhaled an unpleasant odor, like that of decayed food. The precipitate solution, however, did not smell at all. The initial ultrafiltration rate of the recovered protein solution was measured and compared with that of dextrose and dextran by using a high-sensitivity differential manometer, one end of which was connected with the test solution cell, and the other with the serum cell. The ends were separated by a semipermeable membrane. The recovered protein solution at 20 g\/dL concentration was almost equivalent in initial ultrafiltration rate to the 2.0 g\/dL dextrose solution and to 20 g\/dL dextran (MW: 75,000 dalton) solution.","767":"Glucose has widely been used as an osmotic agent in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) but owing to its low molecular weight (MW), ultrafiltration (UF) in a 6-hour dialysate exchange does not appear sufficient. Thus, in the present study, a search was made to find saccharides that would ensure optimal UF, exceeding that obtained with glucose in a 6-hour dwell period. Rats were intraperitoneally infused with peritoneal dialysate (20 mL\/body) containing the same molar concentrations (75.5 mM, 126 mM, or 204 mM) of various osmotic agents including glucose (monosaccharide, MW = 180.16) at concentrations of 1.36%, 2.27%, and 3.86%; maltose (disaccharide, MW = 342.30) at concentrations of 2.58% and 4.32%; maltotriose (trisaccharide, MW = 504.44), at concentrations of 3.81% and 6.36%; and maltopentaose (pentasaccharide, MW = 828.72) at concentrations of 6.26% and 10.4%. Intraperitoneal-fluid volume was measured at 1, 2, 3, 4, and 6 hours. With glucose as the osmotic agent, maximal UF was noted at 2 to 4 hours. UF was more efficient at 6 hours with maltotriose or maltopentaose as the osmotic agent. Even with a trisaccharide or pentasaccharide (molecular weights of 500 to 830), UF at 6 hours was found more efficient, as evidenced by the delay in peritoneal absorption. Fluid removal in 6 hours should be greater when using a dialysate containing oligosaccharides such as maltotriose or maltopentaose in place of glucose.","768":"The aim of this study was to characterize the process of peritoneal healing after catheter insertion in a rat model of peritoneal dialysis using a 1.36% solution (Baxter Dianeal). After catheter insertion (day 1 of experiment), 12 rats were injected daily with 20 mL of 1.36% dialysis solution for 2 weeks. Every second day a sample of 4 hour dialysate was taken from every rat for biochemical analysis, cell count, cell differentiation, and nitrites measurement. The measured parameters decreased during the experiment and stabilized during the second week after catheter insertion. In cell differentiation, we observed an increase in the number of macrophages, with a parallel decrease in the number of neutrophils that was reflected in a significant decrease in the neutrophils\/macrophages ratio. Our results suggest that the process of peritoneal healing after catheter implantation in rats lasts about 2 weeks, and therefore that any biocompatibility study of peritoneal dialysis solutions in rats should be performed at least 2 weeks after catheter insertion.","769":"The effect of N-acetylglucosamine (NAG) on in vitro synthesis of glycosaminoglycans by human peritoneal mesothelial cells and fibroblasts was studied. In contrast to isosmotic concentrations of glucose, NAG increases the synthesis of hyaluronan by mesothelial cells and fibroblasts in a dose-dependent manner. This effect of NAG can be demonstrated in the presence of increased glucose levels in a medium, or in a medium mixed with effluent dialysate obtained from continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Glucose inhibits synthesis of sulphated glycosaminoglycans by peritoneal mesothelial cells and fibroblasts, whereas NAG stimulates their production. Our results demonstrate that NAG is an effective stimulator of the in vitro glycosaminoglycans synthesis by human peritoneal mesothelial cells and fibroblasts.","770":"In recent years it has become clear that the mesothelium plays a prominent homeostatic role in the peritoneum, and can be profoundly altered in disease and during peritoneal dialysis. The cell-surface phenotype of the mesothelial cell has not been thoroughly investigated. This study begins to identify cell surface molecules which may be important in mesothelial functions such as adhesion and interaction with cells of the immune system. The expression of adhesion structures on mesothelial cells such as CD44, the beta integrin chain CD29, the beta 3 integrin chain CD61 and alpha chains CD49 alpha (alpha 1), CD49b (alpha 2), CD49c (alpha 3), CD49e (alpha 5), and CD51 (alpha v) is described. In addition, a wide range of novel molecules including CD90, CD105, CD140b, CD142, CD147, CD151, CD157, CD165, and CD166 are identified. The role and function of such molecules in mesothelial biology and their significance for peritoneal dialysis is discussed.","771":"The peritoneal membrane requires anatomico-functional integrity to guarantee long-term stability for peritoneal dialysis (PD). Since mesothelial cells (MC) are active cells and the first part of the membrane to contact the dialysate, they are important in maintaining this stability. Mesothelial cells released daily into peritoneal effluent are able to grow in culture. This growth capacity may be related to some of the anatomicofunctional characteristics of each peritoneum. Our aim was to culture mesothelial cells taken from peritoneal effluents drained by 32 PD-stable patients, and relate this growth capacity to individual peritoneal data. Cells were taken from a residual fluid after sedimentation, washed twice with phosphate-buffered saline (PBS), and seeded into 25-cm2 tissue-culture flasks. These flasks were incubated in a humidified 5%-CO2 atmosphere. After MC confluence, cells were detached by trypsinization, passaged into 24-well plates, and finally counted. Cells were identified by morphology and immuno-histochemical characteristics. Cells from 28 out of 32 patients showed an appropriate growth in culture. Mesothelial cell confluence was reached in a mean of 18.2 +\/- 8 days. After 7 days of seeding in plate wells, the cell growth showed a significant and progressive increase until day 16. Mesothelial cell growth rate was inversely related to PD duration. Neither peritonitis incidence nor other demographic characteristic were related to MC growth. Creatinine and urea mass transfer coefficients (MTC), but not ultrafiltration (UF) capacity, were significantly related to MC growth rate. In conclusion, the growth in culture of MC taken directly from PD bags is certainly possible. This growth is influenced by some of the intrinsic peritoneal characteristics derived from the peritoneal dialysis process. This tool could be useful in evaluating individual peritoneal conditions and, probably, as a method for peritoneal viability follow-up, although further research is required.","772":"To study the long-term effects of dialysis fluids on the peritoneal cavity, an in vivo model for continuous peritoneal dialysis in rats was developed. Mini vascular access ports were implanted subcutaneously in the neck of the rats and an attached catheter was instilled into the peritoneal cavity. Rats were injected daily with 10 mL of standard 3.86% Dianeal or saline for a period up to 12 weeks. In the peritoneal cavity an initial increase in total cells was observed after 4 weeks of fluid instillation. This had declined after 12 weeks. A similar trend was also seen for macrophage and neutrophil numbers, whereas the percentage of lymphocytes kept increasing in time. An effect of fluid instillation was observed on the density and the morphology of the mesothelial monolayer of the rats. A higher density of cells was observed after 12 weeks, and foci of young mesothelial cells within activated mesothelium were found. The results show that the rat model presented can be compared with the situation in the peritoneal cavity of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, and therefore is suitable for intervention studies.","773":"While theoretically the vasoconstriction associated with the rise in hemoglobin (Hb) level may potentially alter peritoneal transport characteristics, the effect of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) therapy on peritoneal transport in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients remains unclear. We have therefore performed a prospective study on the short-term effect of rHuEPO on the peritoneal transport characteristics in terms of the change in corrected dialysate\/plasma creatinine (D\/Pcr) in the fast peritoneal equilibration test (PET). Eight consecutive CAPD patients started on rHuEPO had fast PETs performed before and 4 to 6 months after the initiation of rHuEPO therapy. Another 8 CAPD patients with stable Hb levels not receiving rHuEPO served as a control group. All patients (study and control) had been on CAPD therapy for more than 3 months upon enrollment, and none had peritonitis during the study period. Patients receiving rHuEPO showed significant increase in Hb level, while the Hb levels of those in the control group remained unchanged. Neither the study nor the control group patients showed significant change in the corrected D\/Pcr value over a mean observation period of 5.25 +\/- 0.89 months. While rHuEPO appears to be effective in increasing the Hb level in CAPD patients, there is no significant impact on the corrected D\/Pcr in the fast PET test observed in this short-term study.","774":"Intraperitoneal use of amphotericin B (AmB) has been reported to increase ultrafiltration during short peritoneal dwell in rabbits. In this study, we investigated the effect of AmB on peritoneal fluid kinetics in rats. A 4 hour dwell using 25 mL of 2.27% glucose dialysis solution without AmB (control, n = 6), with 1 mg\/kg (L-AmB, n = 6) or with 10 mg\/kg AmB (H-AmB, n = 6), and with frequent dialysate and blood sampling was done in Sprague-Dawley rats. 131I-albumin was added to the solution as an intraperitoneal (i.p.) volume marker. There was no difference in the drainage volumes measured at 4 hours of the dwell (26.2 +\/- 1.1 mL, 26.0 +\/- 1.5 mL, and 26.0 +\/- 1.1 mL for the control, L-AmB, and H-AmB groups, respectively.) However, the i.p. volumes were higher at 60 minutes, 90 minutes, and 120 minutes of the dwell in the H-AmB group as compared to the other two groups (1 to 1.5 mL higher, all P &lt; 0.05). There were no differences in the peritoneal fluid absorption rate (KE) and the lymphatic flow rate (KEB) between the three groups. The D\/D0 for glucose and dialysis-over-plasma concentration ratio (D\/P) values for urea, sodium, and total protein, as well as the diffusive mass transport coefficient (KBD) values for these solutes did not differ among the three groups. However, the D\/P as well as the KBD values for potassium were significantly higher in the H-AmB and L-AmB groups as compared to the control group, resulting in significantly higher potassium clearances among the two AmB groups as compared to the control group. Our results suggest that i.p. use of AmB did not increase peritoneal fluid removal after 4 hours of dwell in rats. Although the basic membrane permeability may not be altered by AmB, the higher D\/P and KBD values as well as the higher clearances for potassium in the AmB groups may suggest a local release of potassium due to the cytotoxic effect of AmB. The contribution of water release from local cells to the increase in i.p. volume in the H-AmB group cannot be ruled out.","775":"","776":"To determine whether infants who receive routine childhood immunizations while on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) develop protective antibody levels\/titers, we measured antibody levels\/titers in infants vaccinated with diphtheria\/tetanus\/pertussis (DTP) and measles\/mumps\/rubella (MMR) while on CPD. Eight CPD patients (median age 19 months, range 9-39 months) had measurement of antibody to diphtheria and tetanus toxoids. Seven of the 8 (88%) had protective levels of IgG antibody to both toxoids. The single patient who did not have protective antibody to either diphtheria or tetanus had a low total serum IgG. However, 3 other patients who had low IgG had protective antibody levels. Serial measurements of antibody to tetanus and diphtheria were obtained in 3 of the 8 patients. All maintained protective levels to both diphtheria and tetanus toxoids for as long as 24 months postvaccination. Antibody to rubella was also measured in 5 CPD patients (median 29 months, range 19-39 months), and all had protective antibody titers despite the fact that 3 had low total serum levels. In conclusion, most but not all infants immunized while on CPD have protective antibody levels\/titers to diphtherial, tetanus, rubella. Alteration of the routine schedule for immunizations does not appear to be necessary. However, periodic measurements of antibody may be indicated, particularly to live vial vaccines, prior to transplantation.","777":"A collaborative project was initiated in two pediatric centers to examine the long-term demands and outcomes in families with children commencing renal replacement therapy. Parents returned questionnaires on stress, anxiety, depression, information needs, and intrusion factors pre, at 3 months, 6 months, and annually. A burden of care assessment (BCA) for families was devised using a scoring system based on the domains of patient, sibling, parents, environment, demands of therapy, and dialysis\/transplant factors. Team members also documented medical events and family contacts. In 2 years, 38 patients (26 male) were enrolled with an age range 0.2-18.5 years. Mean stress, anxiety, and depression scores were higher in mothers than fathers, and scores were higher in parents of patients &gt; 10 years compared to the patient group &lt; 10 years. In families with a high initial BCA score there was a positive correlation with maternal stress and anxiety scores. Patients from families with a low BCA score had better growth performance. Older children requiring renal replacement therapy may produce more stress and intrusion for parents than younger children. Burden of care assessments may be a useful means of predicting families who require greater support from the multidisciplinary team.","778":"In patients with chronic renal failure (CRF), parenteral transmission of the hepatitis B virus (HBV) is common. The response to the recombinant vaccine is 50%-80% of seroprotection. Therefore, to improve seroprotection, different strategies such as dose augmentation, vaccination at the predialysis stage, subcutaneous application, and using interleukin were tried, with unsatisfactory results. In children, there are no studies demonstrating the efficacy of the vaccine. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the recombinant vaccine in children with CRF, in late as well as early phases, through the quantification of antibodies against the surface antigen in response to different doses of the vaccine against HBV. There were 103 patients who were assigned to three groups: (1) 25 patients with CRF in the early phase (undergoing pharmacological treatment only); (2) 67 patients with CRF in the late phase (treatment with peritoneal dialysis or hemodialysis); (3) 11 patients with CRF in the early phase (undergoing low-dose pharmacological treatment only). The antibodies against the serum antigen (HBsAg) were measured by the aEIA method. Urea, creatinine, and creatinine clearance were measured at 0, 2, and 12 months. In our seroprotection results we observed that group 1 and 3 developed earlier seroconversion (50% first month). In patients undergoing dialysis the seroconversion happened in 91% at month 13, but with lower concentration than group 1 and\/or group 3 (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, there is a better response in predialysis patients. The levels of antibodies are similar in groups 1 and 3 (with small doses), which are similar to the complete doses for an efficient immunity in children with chronic renal failure.","779":"Uremic polyneuropathy (UPNP) is a serious complication of chronic renal failure (CRF) in adults; however, its prevalence is unknown in the pediatric population. An easy-to-perform maneuver for its detection in children is the evaluation of \"H\" reflex. The objective of this study was to validate the usefulness of the \"H\" reflex maneuver for the diagnosis of UPNP in pediatric dialysis patients for CRF. Thirty-seven CRF patients were paired with healthy controls by age and sex. The patients were being treated with dialysis or one of its variants. Information was obtained regarding diagnosis, duration, and control of dialysis. Neurological examination was performed, conduction velocities in sensory and motor nerves were measured, and \"H\" reflex elicited bilaterally. Peripheral polyneuropathy was determined by the presence of at least two nerves with alterations in latency and\/or conduction velocities. It was found that 59.4% (22\/37) of the children with CRF treated with dialysis developed UPNP, 17 with ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, and 5 with hemodialysis. There was no difference in diagnosis, duration of dialysis, or control of the same in these patients from other CRF patients who did not have UPNP. All patients were clinically asymptomatic. \"H\" reflex showed a sensibility of 44%, a specificity of 87%, a predictive value positive of 66%, and a predictive value negative of 76%, when measured to 28 msec. With a 30 msec duration specificity rises to 95%. UPNP presents asymptomatically in pediatric patients. \"H\" reflex is an adequate screening test for the selection of pediatric patients to be tested further.","780":"The frequency of Staphylococcus aureus (SA) nasal carriage and the impact of antibiotic therapy remain undefined in children receiving long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD). We obtained a nasal culture for SA every 4-12 weeks in 21 children (mean age 7.03 +\/- 5.8 years) receiving PD from January 1992 to August 1996 (total of 35.3 patient-years). In each case, SA nasal carriage (NSA+) was treated with intranasal mupirocin for 7 days. NSA+ was detected in 13 patients (61.9%) who received dialysis for 28.9 patient-years. Eight (61.5%) of 13 patients became NSA+ during the initial 3 months of dialysis. Seven (53.8%) of the NSA+ patients had 11 exit-site infections (ESI) and one episode of peritonitis (0.42 total infections\/patient-year) due to SA. The 8 patients without SA nasal carriage (NSA-) received dialysis for 6.4 patient-years. None of the NSA-patients had an ESI or peritonitis with SA. Finally, the incidence of non-SA infections in the NSA+ and NSA- groups was not different (0.62 vs 0.31 total infections\/patient-year, p &gt; 0.05). In conclusion, there appears to be an association between SA nasal carriage and SA ESI in children on PD. The risk of SA peritonitis in NSA+ patients treated with mupirocin may be minimal. The risk of SA nasal carriage may increase with time on dialysis.","781":"Children on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) have a higher incidence of dialysate leakage than patients receiving cycler dialysis. To date, fibrin glue has been used to treat dialysate leakage but not as a method of prevention. Therefore, we conducted a prospective study in which 20 catheters were implanted in 19 children, with each catheter randomly assigned to either the treatment group (1 mL of fibrin glue added to peritoneal cuff suture) or the control group. There was no difference in mean patient age, elapsed time between catheter implantation and first catheter usage, and albumin concentration between the two groups. Dialysate leakage was detected in 4 patients in the control group, 3 of whom underwent early initiation of dialysis, but none of the patients in the treatment group (including 4 with early dialysis) had a similar problem. In summary, these preliminary data suggest that fibrin glue may be of benefit when applied at the time of catheter implantation. Further experience is necessary before this method can be routinely recommended.","782":"Double-cuffed peritoneal catheters (DCCs) may be more effective at preventing penetrating infection than single-cuffed catheters (SCCs). The aim of this study was to see whether DCCs conferred any benefit in the pediatric population. Twenty consecutive SCCs inserted for chronic dialysis were compared with 20 subsequent DCCs. All catheters were inserted by a single operator (MAL). Outcome was assessed by the number of exit-site infections (ESIs) and episodes of peritonitis. There was no difference in the age or sex distribution of the groups, both having 50% of patients under 5 years. The SCCs were followed for 106 patient-months (1 still in situ) and the DCCs for 145 patient-months (11 still in situ). Peritonitis-related catheter loss was significantly more common with SCCs (9 vs 1, p &lt; 0.01). S. aureus was a significantly more common cause of peritonitis in SCCs (10 vs 3, p &lt; 0.03), although almost all ESIs were with this organism. The relative risk of S. aureus peritonitis with a SCC compared to a DCC was 2.077 (95% confidence interval, CI, 1.17-3.69), and the relative risk of catheter loss with peritonitis was 7.5 for SCCs (95% CI 1.14-49.6). In conclusion, double-cuffed peritoneal catheters are more effective than single-cuffed catheters in preventing penetrating infection in infants and children.","783":"An optimal intraperitoneal volume (Vip) may be the most critical and least-used option to enhance higher clearances of small solutes. A higher Vip is more effective in increasing small solute clearances when compated to a lower Vip and more frequent exchanges. Additionally, a higher Vip generates minimal intraperitoneal pressure (Pip) in the supine position. Therefore, the highest tolerated Vip should be used at night while the child is sleeping in the supine position. Therefore, in 5 children, mean age 7 years, 4 months, on continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) (Baxter HomeChoice), we tested the impact of Vip on tolerance (measured by Pip) measurements, and efficiency [assessed by daily Kt\/Vurea and weekly creatinine clearance (Kcreatinine]. Basal Pip was determined for the usually prescribed Vip. Then Vip was increased during a morning outpatient study day, in 30-minute stages, stepping up to an increase of 25% of the basal Pip (upper limit 18 cm of water) level reached at the so-called optimized Vip used for the prescription of an optimal total dialysate volume for a 4-week period. The latest study week was compared to the prestudy week. The optimized Vip of 1230 +\/- 70 mL\/m2 was significantly higher than the basal Vip, 940 +\/- 90 mL\/m2. The dialysis dose improved both in terms of Kt\/V urea from 0.23 +\/- 0.02 to 0.29 +\/- 0.03 and Kcreatinine from 60 +\/- 5 to 76 +\/- 9 L\/1.73 m2\/week. The supine position allowed the 25% Pip increment from 10.2 +\/- 2.5 to 12.5 +\/- 3.1 cm water, without any obvious clinical side effects.","784":"Dietary protein restriction, progressive loss of renal adaptive capacity, and uremic toxicity may contribute to the development of malnutrition and water retention in severe chronic renal failure (CRF). Malnutrition is also common in children treated with chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD). It is not clear how the start of CPD influences body composition of children with CRF. We used a bioimpedance analysis device (BIA 101S Akern) to measure resistance and reactance in 7 children, with residual creatinine clearance of about 5 mL\/min\/1.73 m2 at the start of CPD (t0) and repeated the test 6 months later (t1). Distance (D), which is considered a reliable index of hydration and nutrition, was obtained from resistance (R) and reactance (Xc) by calculating phase angle (PA). BIA values of our patients were compared with those of healthy children of the same statural age from a series of 551 controls. There was an overall improvement of Xc, PA, and D after 6 months of CPD. In some cases D did not normalize, which indicates that some children with CRF on a restricted protein diet may present changes of body composition that are only partially reversed by short-term CPD. The present indications for the start of CPD should probably be reassessed, at least in some cases, to prevent malnutrition.","785":"To evaluate (1) differences in the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) achieved using continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD) solutions containing different amounts of glucose and (2) intraindividual reproducibility of PETs performed twice within an interval of 8 months on CPD, we investigated 39 PETs in 13 children aged 2.4-19.0 years (median 10.6 years) on stable CPD regimens. The fill volume was 1 L\/m2 body surface area. We used a standard CPD solution (Fresenius) with a 2.3% glucose content (groups 2.3a and 2.3b) two times within an interval of 1-8 months. A third test was done between the two with a CPD solution of 1.5% glucose (group 1.5). Equilibration quotients, that is, substrate concentration in dialysis fluid divided by substrate concentration in plasma (D\/P), did not show any statistically significant differences between groups 1.5 and 2.3a or between groups 2.3a and 2.3b. A significant difference was seen in the decline of glucose content of dialysate between groups 1.5 and 2.3 but not between groups 2.3a and 2.3b. Ultrafiltration was higher in groups 2.3a and 2.3b compared with group 1.5. Inter- and intraindividual variability between solute transfer was small during follow-up in stable CPD patients. Different glucose contents of 1.5 and 2.3 g\/dL dialysis fluid had no measurable influence on PET results of stable CPD patients. For standard PETs, reducing the glucose content of dialysis fluid to isoosmolarity is not necessary.","786":"In an attempt to assess the effect of angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) on anemia and recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) requirements in peritoneal dialysis patients, we evaluated 5 patients treated with ACEIs for one year, and the results were compared with data from a control group (N = 5). In response to ACEIs, the mean hemoglobin value decreased progressively, reaching statistical significance after 6 months and thereafter (basal, 10.7 +\/- 0.8; month 6, 10.3 +\/- 0.9; month 12, 10.3 +\/- 0.5 g\/dL, p &lt; 0.05), with no variations in the control group. The rHuEPO requirements experienced a progressive increase in ACEI-treated patients, from 4400 +\/- 1516 U\/week at basal to 8600 +\/- 2880 U\/week at the conclusion of the study (p &lt; 0.01). Serum erythropoietin concentration remained stable during the study in both groups of patients. In conclusion, rHuEPO requirements necessary to maintain a stable hemoglobin concentration are greater in subjects under ACEI therapy. ACEI may be an important cause of resistance to rHuEPO, an effect not mediated by a decrease in endogenous erythropoietin.","787":"The purpose of this study was to clarify the pathophysiological role of glucose and glucose transporters (GLUTs) in the proliferation and production of extracellular matrix (ECM) in peritoneal fibroblasts. Peritoneal fibroblasts from rat omentum were cultured in medium M199 with 5% fetal bovine serum (FBS) with (Group B) and without (Group A) 4% glucose. The rate of cell growth at the M stage of the cell cycle in Group B was higher than that in Group A at 12 and 24 hours after culture. However, cell numbers in Group B were less than in Group A at 24, 72, and 120 hours after culture. The GLUT inhibitor suppressed the proliferation of cells 72 and 120 hours after culture. The procollagen III peptide (PIIIP) contents in the supernatant of cells cultured in a high glucose medium were higher than those of control cells at 24, 72, and 120 hours after culture. PIIIP levels of cells cultured with the GLUT inhibitor were also higher than those of cells without the GLUT inhibitor. These results suggest that initially glucose stimulates cell proliferation and thereafter inhibits its proliferation. GLUTs may accelerate the proliferation of peritoneal fibroblasts. We suggest that glucose stimulates the ECM component PIIIP, and GLUT may have an inhibitory effect on the production of the ECM component PIIIP.","788":"To evaluate the effects of metabolic acidosis on serum albumin and other nutritional parameters in long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, we undertook a retrospective study involving 106 CAPD patients who had monthly biochemical measurements and urea kinetic studies every 6 months for more than 2 years. The patients were divided into three groups according to their mean total CO2 (tCO2) level of the 2-year follow-up (Group I: mean tCO2 &lt; 22 mmol\/L; Group II: 22 mmol\/L &lt; or = tCO2 &lt; 26 mmol\/L; Group III: mean tCO2 &gt; or = 26 mmol\/L), and the clinical, biochemical, and urea kinetic data were compared between the three groups. The mean tCO2 in Groups I, II, and III were 20.62 +\/- 1.2 mmol\/L, 23.91 +\/- 1.1 mmol\/L, and 27.3 +\/- 0.8 mmol\/L, respectively. The percentage of body weight (Bwt) to ideal body weight (IBW) was significantly higher in Group I (113.1 +\/- 15.3%) compared to Group II (103.5 +\/- 11.5%) and Group III (98.7 +\/- 8.0%) (p &lt; 0.05), but the percentage of lean body mass (LBM) to Bwt was not different between the three groups. Compared to Group III, Group I had significantly higher blood urea nitrogen (BUN) (61.1 +\/- 14.3 vs 46.1 +\/- 7.2 mg\/dL, p &lt; 0.05), serum albumin (4.04 +\/- 0.31 vs 3.75 +\/- 0.39 g\/dL, p &lt; 0.05), and normalized protein equivalent to nitrogen appearance (NPNA) (1.02 +\/- 0.21 vs 0.88 +\/- 0.14 g\/kg\/day, p &lt; 0.05), and more ultrafiltration volume (1.4 +\/- 0.4 vs 1.0 +\/- 0.3 L\/day, p &lt; 0.05), in spite of comparable dialysis dose and albumin loss into the dialysate. No differences were observed in the three groups in the changes of tCO2, Bwt\/IBW, LBM\/Bwt, BUN, and albumin from the baseline values after the 2-year follow-up. Using stepwise multiple regression analysis, NPNA, Bwt\/IBW, and ultrafiltration volume were independent factors affecting mean tCO2 level. In conclusion, low tCO2 levels in long-term CAPD patients may reflect increased protein intake, and the mild to moderate degrees of metabolic acidosis may not affect the nutritional status of well-dialyzed CAPD patients.","789":"A quality assessment (QA) activity revealed that the percentage of parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels above 300 micrograms\/dL was higher in the peritoneal dialysis (PD) unit than in the hemodialysis (HD) unit (44% vs 27%). To reduce the proportion of patients with a target PTH above 200 micrograms\/dL, a protocol that emphasized control of the serum phosphate level, standard pulsed doses of calcitriol, and increased patient education was created for the management of renal osteodystrophy. Serum calcium, phosphate, and PTH levels were obtained according to the protocol from July 1994 through June 1996. The percentage of patients achieving a PTH level below 200 micrograms\/dL increased from 40% in June 1994 to 57% in June 1996. Significant differences were found in PTH levels at baseline and at test times 1, 2, and 3. Hypercalcemia (Ca &gt; 12) occurred in 4% of the 532 Ca levels drawn during the study period and were due to breaches of protocol. In conclusion, we have confirmed previous work indicating that pulsed calcitriol can control elevated PTH levels in PD patients. Furthermore, we have developed a protocol that can be used as a QA tool to reduce the prevalence of hyperparathyroidism in the outpatient PD setting without inducing excess hypercalcemia.","790":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of pulse oral calcitriol in the control of secondary hyperparathyroidism in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, addressing the effects after withdrawal. We studied 15 patients with intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) plasma levels above 250 pg\/mL. The initial calcitriol dose was 8 or 4 micrograms\/week, administered in two doses, according to whether the iPTH plasma levels were above or below 400 pg\/mL. This dose was modified during the follow-up according to the response. Serum iPTH levels decreased in all patients after the first month (559 +\/- 243 to 212 +\/- 94 pg\/mL, p &lt; 0.001). Serum calcium levels significantly increased during therapy, while serum phosphorus levels did not change. The mean duration of the treatment was 95 +\/- 57 days. Nine patients reached the target iPTH levels without complications, and in 6 patients the treatment was interrupted because of hypercalcemia. One month after finishing pulse therapy, a significant decrease in serum calcium levels and an increase in iPTH levels were observed. These values were similar to baseline data and were significantly higher than those found during the pulse calcitriol period. Pulse oral calcitriol administration seems to be a short-term, efficient therapy for secondary hyper-parathyroidism in PD patients. However, after the end of pulse therapy, iPTH serum levels return to baseline values, suggesting long-term therapeutic failure.","791":"The purpose of our study was to investigate catheter outcome of persistent exit-site\/tunnel infections (ESI\/TIs) in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The patients underwent removal of subcutaneous cuff due to persistent ESI\/TI from January 1989 to December 1996 in a tertiary referral university hospital. Two hundred and twenty-three patients (138 male, 85 female) underwent 244 double-cuff coiled Swan neck catheter implantations surgically. Twenty-nine patients (11.8%) had persistent ESI\/TI for more than 6 months with the same organism. Sixteen patients (52%) underwent subcutaneous cuff excision. Thirteen (48%) patients refused and were managed conservatively. Two hundred and forty-three episodes of ESI\/TI were observed over 4970 patient-months with a rate of 0.58 episodes\/patient\/year. Twenty-nine patients (11.8%) had persistent ESI\/TI with S. aureus in 19, Pseudomonas aeruginosa in 9 (31%), and Serratia marcescens in one (3%) patient. Fourteen (88%) persistent ESI\/TIs resolved after subcutaneous cuff excision. None of the patients with ESI\/TI responded to conservative treatment. ESI\/TI-related peritonitis decreased from 11 episodes to 5 episodes after cuff excision. In contrast, episodes of peritonitis increased from one to 9 with conservative management during a follow-up of mean 18 months (4-38 months). Four (31%) catheters were lost in the conservative group, while 3 (19%) were lost after cuff excision. ESI\/TI-related peritonitis decreased after subcutaneous cuff excision but increased with conservative management for ESI\/TI. ESI\/TI resolved in 88% of the patients after cuff excision, while none resolved with conservative treatment.","792":"A randomized, multicenter clinical trial was conducted to evaluate the efficiency in preventing exit-site infection of a silver ring mounted on peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter and placed at skin level (designed by Grosse-Siestrup, 1992). Eligible patients stratified by diabetes mellitus were monitored prospectively for 12 months using a detailed structured inventory. New patients starting PD treatment during the study period were followed for at least 3 months. Basic characteristics of the silver ring group (N = 86) and controls (N = 88) such as age, sex, S. aureus nasal carriage, type of PD catheter placement and catheter indwelling time, mode of PD, and number of connections for bag exchanges did not differ significantly between the two groups. Nineteen exit-site infections occurred in the silver ring group and 15 in the control group. The incidence of \"equivocal\" exit-site findings and time of improvement to a \"good\" or \"perfect\" exit site were similar in both groups. Kaplan-Meier analysis of the probability of an infection-free time interval revealed no statistically significant difference between subjects with the silver device and controls. In 6 of the 86 cases, displacement of the silver ring caused severe tunnel infection followed by catheter loss in 2. We conclude that the silver ring used in this setting is not effective in preventing exit-site infections in PD patients.","793":"Studies first theorized and then proved that \"flush before fill\" decreased the incidence of peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The purpose of this study was to examine the relationship between the incidence of peritonitis and the use of cyclers with the \"flush-before-fill\" option. We followed our automated PD (APD) population from 1 August 1994 to 30 September 1996. The patients were divided into two groups. Group I utilized cyclers with the \"flush-before-fill\" option and experienced 8 incidences of peritonitis in 225 patient-months of use, for a peritonitis rate of 1:28. Group II utilized cyclers without the \"flush-before-fill\" option and experienced 22 incidences of peritonitis in 225 patient-months of use, for a peritonitis rate of 1:10.2. Gram-positive organisms were responsible for 3\/8, or 37.5%, of incidences of peritonitis for Group I and 13\/22, or 59%, of peritonitis incidence for Group II. The results of the study indicate a reduction in both the incidence of peritonitis and the incidence of peritonitis caused by gram-positive organisms for APD when utilizing cyclers with the \"flush-before-fill\" option.","794":"Sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) is a very serious complication of CAPD. The present study was conducted on 7 SEP patients (4 male, 3 female, average age 33 years) from among 197 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients over a period of 14 years. SEP affected 3.7% (7\/197) of the CAPD patients in this study, and its annual incidence was found to be 2.6\/1000. All 7 patients in this study exhibited ileus. The 3 patients with severe peritonitis and sepsis had transient ileus. The prognosis was poor for 3 patients who reported prior ultrafiltration problems. One of these patients died one year after the onset of SEP. The prognosis for one of the patients showed an intermediate course. SEP patients may possibly be divided into subgroups based on the course of prognosis. SEP patients with previous UF failure and longer duration of CAPD showed poorer prognoses. The quality of life, especially in regard to eating, is poor.","795":"In spite of several recommendations, choosing the initial antibiotic to treat continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) peritonitis remains difficult. In our prospective randomized study we attempted to evaluate the efficacy and safety of less toxic combinations of cephalosporins with vancomycin or netilmycin. From November 1993 to September 1996 we treated 52 episodes of peritonitis in 34 patients. Peritonitis was diagnosed according to the valid criteria. Patients were treated for 14 - 28 days with a combination of either cefazolin plus netilmycin or vancomycin plus ceftazidime. The most frequent bacteria causing peritonitis in the two groups were comparable. The efficacy of the cefazolin\/netilmycin combination was 91.6% (22\/24) without yeasts and 84.0% (21\/25) in the vancomycin\/ceftazidime combination. There were no statistically significant differences between the two otherwise efficient combinations of antibiotics. No side effects were observed. We believe that the frequent use of vancomycin could be avoided thus reducing the risks of resistance and ototoxicity.","796":"Recent studies demonstrate that 14-membered macrolides increase permeability and destruction of Pseudomonas biofilms. The effect of a macrolide antibiotic, erythromycin, on methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) biofilm on Silastic catheter materials in comparison with two different quinolone antibiotics, sparfloxacin (SPFX) and a new quinolone, SYN 1193, was examined. Two different MRSA strains were grown in biofilm, using Mueller-Hinton broth with and without the addition of 10% pooled normal human serum (PNHS), in a modified Robbins device, at 37 degrees C for 24, 48, and 72 hours. Two different clinical MRSA strains were used and minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC) were determined at the time intervals mentioned. Three different dosages of each antibiotic were tested: 5.0, 20.0, and 50.0 micrograms\/mL. In addition, a constant dosage of SPFX and SYN 1193, in combination with varying dosages of erythromycin, was tested under similar experimental conditions. SYN 1193 demonstrated the highest MBC in comparison to SPFX; addition of PNHS did not alter the effect of SYN 1193. However, erythromycin alone and in combination with SPFX and SYN 1193 had no effect on MBC. We conclude that (1) macrolide antibiotic erythromycin has poor MRSA biofilm permeability and killing in comparison to SPFX and SYN 1193, and (2) SYN 1193 had the highest MBC to MRSA biofilm.","797":"During systemic infection, the serum lipopolysaccharide binding protein (LBP) binds to the lipid A component of bacterial endotoxins and facilitates its delivery to the CD 14 receptor on the cell surface of macrophages, where proinflammatory cytokines are released. There is no knowledge to date whether LBP is also present in the effluent of patients with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)-associated peritonitis. We investigated the dialysis effluent of 37 patients with CAPD peritonitis for immunoreactive LBP, tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha, and interleukin (IL)-1 beta and compared the findings with the cytokine levels in 20 noninfected CAPD patients. The mean +\/- SEM concentrations of LBP, TNF-alpha, and IL-1 beta were significantly higher in the effluent of patients with peritonitis than in noninfected CAPD effluent. In comparison to controls (0.23 +\/- 0.05 microgram\/mL), LBP was 0.68 +\/- 0.13 microgram\/mL in the effluent of patients with CAPD-associated infectious peritonitis. For TNF-alpha, levels were 0.50 +\/- 0.25 pg\/mL in the control effluent versus 124.7 +\/- 46.6 pg\/mL in the effluent of peritonitis patients. For IL-1 beta the levels were 0.24 +\/- 0.14 pg\/mL in the control effluent and 71.23 +\/- 17.53 pg\/mL in the peritonitis patients. Our findings demonstrate that LBP is significantly elevated in the effluent of CAPD patients during an episode of CAPD-associated peritonitis and might be used as a marker of intraperitoneal bacterial infection.","798":"Deficient production of nitric oxide may be responsible for the defective defense barrier and persistence of bacterial infection. To gain insight into amino acid-metabolism and L-arginine-nitric oxide system, we studied 34 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) (20 males, 14 females, with a mean age of 53.5 years and a mean duration on PD of 29.7 months). The concentrations of amino acids, including L-arginine, were measured in peritoneal dialysate and in the serum. The data demonstrated that patients with ESRD on PD have normal serum amino-acid profiles, whereas those with acute peritonitis develop L-arginine deficiency (from 99 +\/- 9 to 52 +\/- 9 mumol\/L). In addition, levels of asparagine, glycine, proline (nonessential) as well as valine, threonine, and lysine (essential) were reduced in patients with peritonitis. The majority of patients with acute bacterial peritonitis have increased nitric oxide production as judged by the level of nitrites in the dialysate (36 +\/- 2 vs 57 +\/- 6 mumol\/L). The recovery from peritonitis was associated with a decline in nitric-oxide generation. There was a smaller subgroup of these patients that showed paradoxically low nitrite levels during acute peritonitis. The nitrite: L-arginine ratio in the peritoneal dialysate was increased in patients with peritonitis, further suggesting the development of substrate deficiency. These findings implicate L-arginine as a conditionally essential amino acid in PD patients with acute peritonitis. Further studies are needed to address the issue of L-arginine supplementation in such patients.","799":"Peritoneal macrophages (PMs) are very potent producers of proinflammatory stimuli, such as interleukin (IL)-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-alpha. After contact with invading micro-organisms, PMs produce different cytokines, both pro- and anti-inflammatory. Therefore, they are crucial in the regulation of inflammatory events. The aim of this study was to investigate whether the production of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha is dependent on the bacterial species used. PMs were harvested from spent peritoneal dialysis effluent and subsequently stimulated with five strains of bacteria in two different concentrations. After 24 hours of stimulation, supernatants were harvested and analyzed for both IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha content. IL-1 beta was measured with a commercial ELISA, and TNF-alpha was determined with a bioassay. Both the IL-1 beta and the TNF-alpha production were species-dependent. One strain of Staphylococcus aureus and one strain of Staphylococcus epidermidis induced a markedly higher response in both IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha than the other species. This response was also dose-dependent, and this holds true for all species. In conclusion, the IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha response by PMs is both species- and dose-dependent.","800":"The authors studied the effect of L-2-oxothiazolidine-carboxylate (OTZ), a substrate for intracellular glutathione synthesis, in an in vivo model of lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced peritonitis in rats. The addition of LPS to dialysis fluid increased the white blood cell (WBC) count and the nitrite (index of NO synthesis) level in the dialysate. The simultaneous addition of OTZ to the dialysis fluid prevented an increase of WBCs but not of nitrites in the dialysate. Intraperitoneal inflammation was accompanied by a decrease in net transperitoneal ultrafiltration, an increase in the absorption of glucose, and a loss of protein into the dialysate. OTZ partially reversed the effect of peritonitis on net ultrafiltration. Peritoneal leukocytes from rats exposed to LPS showed a reduced concentration of glutathione, an effect that was reversed in the presence of OTZ. These results show that the supplementation of dialysis fluid with OTZ modified the peritoneal reaction to acute inflammation.","801":"Acute renal failure remains a major problem in pediatric intensive care unit (PICU) patients. Although in most handbooks peritoneal dialysis (PD) is still considered to be the first choice for children &lt; 20 kg and there is some evidence that PD may preserve and\/or favor recuperation of renal function, most PICU departments are using continuous veno-venous hemofiltration and dialysis or hemodialysis as treatment. The main reasons for this are workload for the PICU nurses, catheter problems, the risk of peritonitis, and limited ultrafiltration. In a retrospective study (1992-1995) in 46 patients (age 3 days to 14 years), automated PD (APD) was the initial treatment in 44 patients. Complications of the Seldinger-placed Cook (pleuropericard) catheter were limited: leakage (1\/44); bleeding: n = 0; obstruction or dislocation: n = 4; peritonitis: n = 1 (Candida); ultrafiltration (UF) problems: n = 3. APD in children with acute renal function (ARF) is a good alternative for continuous veno-venous dialysis. Placement of a pigtail (Cook) catheter is a quick (10 min), safe procedure, with low leakage risk. This, together with the low manipulation rate, gives a low peritonitis rate. The use of the cycler makes frequent changes of small volumes possible, resulting in better clearance, good UF, no interference with hemodynamic or respiratory stability, and a reduced workload.","802":"A limited number of authors have demonstrated that temporary subcutaneous implantation of peritoneal dialysis catheters (\"Moncrief\") reduces infectious complications and increases catheter life expectancy. Two operations are required to use the Moncrief catheter as compared to only one operation when peritoneal dialysis catheters are exteriorized for immediate use (\"Updike\"). The questions arise, then, are these findings reproducible and which catheter is the most cost-effective? In an effort to support these premises, a retrospective review of 195 patients who received peritoneal dialysis catheters from 1991 to 1995 was undertaken. Demographics, complications, life expectancy analysis, and costs were compared between Moncrief and Updike catheters. There were no significant differences between the groups, and comparisons revealed a clinically evident and statistically significant decrease in the incidence of infections with Moncrief catheters. At both one- and two-year follow-up, Moncrief catheters demonstrated a significant increase in longevity as compared to the Updike catheters. Cost comparisons between the catheter systems revealed that if patients were not undergoing immediate dialysis, placement of a Moncrief catheter was more cost-effective. Conversely, if the patient was currently undergoing dialysis, placement of an Updike catheter was more cost-effective. However, sensitivity analysis revealed that shorter exteriorization times would make the Moncrief catheter the more cost-effective choice in this patient population. In conclusion, temporary subcutaneous implantation of peritoneal dialysis catheters significantly decreases the incidence of infectious complications, increases catheter life expectancy, and is the cost-effective choice for patients who will undergo peritoneal dialysis.","803":"The aim of this study was to identify the advantages of a bicarbonate solution with a low sodium concentration. Twelve children (3 days-6 years) with acute renal failure (ARF), positive fluid balance, and lactate acidosis (&gt; 40 mg\/dL) were treated by automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) with frequent exchanges of small fill volumes of a hypertonic solution. For Day 1 we used PD1\/PD4 Dianeal (3.86%) (Baxter). After 24 hours we switched to a HCO3 solution: 38 mmol\/L, Na 128 mmol\/L. As the control group, we studied retrospectively the last 12 children of the previous period who were treated with APD. The age distribution was 4 days to 4 years. No significant differences were found between the groups for serum creatinine, blood urea nitrogen, and fluid overload (Day 1 to Day 4). Although the values for lactate and Na were not different before the start of the study (Day 1) and after 24 hours of Dianeal (Day 2), they were significantly lower in the study group on Day 4 [HCO3 53 (23-83), Na 148 (137-136) mEq\/L] than in the control group [lactate 148 (137-156), Na 154 (142-165) mEq\/L]. A low sodium concentration results in higher sodium extraction, which is important for patients with fluid overload. Low sodium concentrations in APD are needed because the peritoneal membrane \"sieves\" the sodium during short dwells. HCO3 dialysis is a logical choice for patients with lactate acidosis, resulting in a significant lower serum lactate and increase of BE after 48 hours of treatment.","804":"We wished to investigate lactic dehydrogenase (LDH) and its isoenzymes in the dialysate of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients under noninfected conditions. Twenty-seven continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients (20 males, 7 females; mean age 53 years; average duration of CAPD 29 months) were studied. Overnight dialysate and blood samples were collected. LDH activities, isoenzymes, glucose, creatinine of both specimens, and cancer antigen 125 (CA125) of the dialysate were determined. Serum and dialysate LDH was 470 +\/- 163 and 10 +\/- 4 U\/L, respectively. Percentages of LDH1, LDH2, LDH3, LDH4, and LDH5 were 29 +\/- 5, 37 +\/- 4, 20 +\/- 3, 9 +\/- 4, and 6 +\/- 2 (%) in the serum, 21 +\/- 5, 30 +\/- 5, 23 +\/- 6, 16 +\/- 4, and 8 +\/- 3 (%) in the dialysate, respectively. There was no significant relationship between the serum and dialysate LDHs. There were no correlations between dialysate LDH, patient's age, duration of CAPD, peritoneal transport properties, and dialysate CA125. Although it was still difficult to determine the origin of dialysate LDH, a predominance of LDH5 was not observed in noninfected stable patients. Dialysate LDH activities were low, and the isoenzyme patterns were similar to those of the serum. Alteration of the isoenzyme patterns may suggest unfavorable events, such as infection, in the peritoneal cavity.","805":"Lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] is an independent atherogenic risk factor. Lp(a) levels are elevated in patients on renal replacement therapy (RRT). This study looked at the effect of change of RRT on serum lipid and Lp(a) levels. Three groups were identified: (1) patients on dialysis who were transplanted; (2) those who had lost their transplants through immunorejection; (3) those who changed from continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) to hemodialysis (HD). All Lp(a) measurements were taken at least 3 months after the change of therapy. Our results were as follows: Group A (n = 21): 8 CAPD and 13 HD patients were transplanted. Median Lp(a) levels fell posttransplantation in the CAPD group (15.6 mg\/dL vs 11.4 mg\/dL, p = 0.04). The HD group showed a rise in cholesterol, low-density (LDL) and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) levels, with no change in Lp(a) levels. Group B (n = 11): 7 patients started CAPD and 4 HD. Overall, there was a marked increase in Lp(a) levels: median 38.2 mg\/dL vs 55.9 mg\/dL (p = 0.04), reflecting an increase in those starting CAPD (27.8 mg\/dL vs 60.0 mg\/dL, p = 0.01), with little change in the HD group (40.45 mg\/dL vs 40.05 mg\/dL). However, there was a decrease in cholesterol (7.4 mmol\/L vs 5.1 mmol\/L, p = 0.002) and LDL (5.5 mmol\/L vs 3.3 mmol\/L, p = 0.004). Group C (n = 16): 16 patients changed from CAPD to HD. Lp(a) levels were higher while on CAPD, as compared to when on HD (58.9 mg\/dL vs 49 mg\/dL, p = 0.03). Cholesterol (6.62 mmol\/L vs 5.26 mmol\/L, p = 0.006) and LDL (4.48 mmol\/L vs 3.40 mmol\/L, p = 0.004) were also higher when on CAPD. In conclusion, serum Lp(a) levels are clearly affected by the mode of the RRT, being highest in CAPD, and decline after transplantation or conversion to HD. Atherogenic risk is thus likely to differ between the modes of RRT and may be greatest for those on CAPD.","806":"The rationale for using intraperitoneal chemotherapy is based on three phenomena: certain types of tumor are confined to the abdominal cavity for many years; the ability to deliver the drug directly to the surface of tumor deposits; the pharmacological advantage of attaining high local concentrations of the drug within the cavity. Current techniques of intraperitoneal chemotherapy do not use a specially designed carrier solution, which greatly restricts flexibility and does not permit continuous ambulatory intraperitoneal chemotherapy necessary for optimal use of cell cycle-specific antitumor agents. Using icodextrin 20 as a carrier solution containing 50% of the dose of 5-fluorouracil in a 24-hour dwell, simultaneously with a 24-hour elastomeric infusor device containing 50% of the dose, we have succeeded in carrying out continuous ambulatory intraperitoneal chemotherapy, 5 days out of 7 for up to 12 weeks, exposing the peritoneal contents to drug concentrations a thousand-fold greater than attained in the serum in a Phase I clinical trial. These studies have for the first time demonstrated that it is possible to expose continuously for long periods intraperitoneal tumor deposits to sustained high levels of cell cycle-specific cytotoxic agents.","807":"Rapid growth in the number of dialysis patients over the age of 65 is occurring coincidentally with the overall aging of the general population. Elderly patients are often poor and physically incapacitated, needing family or social support. These patients may also be susceptible to malnutrition and have multiple complicating medical disorders in addition to end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Thus the selection of an appropriate dialysis modality is particularly critical in elderly patients. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) offers many advantages to elderly patients, including hemodynamic stability, steady-state chemistries, and no need to create a vascular access. However, little data are available in the literature documenting the use of CAPD in this setting. Therefore, to evaluate the efficacy of CAPD in elderly patients, we retrospectively reviewed the clinical outcomes of 23 patients 65 years of age or older at the start of CAPD (elderly group). Then for each of these patients, 23 comparison subjects younger than 65 were chosen from CAPD patients at our hospital (control group). The control group was matched for sex, CAPD duration, cause of ESRD, and initial connection device. In the elderly group, 23 patients (12 male, 11 female) with a mean age of 70 +\/- 4 years (range 65-86 years) were treated with CAPD for 15 +\/- 17 months. In the control group, 23 patients (12 male, 11 female) with a mean age of 41 +\/- 11 (range 18-57) were treated with CAPD for 16 +\/- 17 months. Diabetic nephropathy was the cause of ESRD in 35% of patients. The negative CAPD selection of patients was higher in the elderly group (61% vs 17%, p = 0.0025) as well as in the group that needed a helper (61% vs 17%, p = 0.0025). The exit-site infection and peritonitis rates were not statistically different between the two groups (0.43 vs 0.91 episodes\/patient-year and 1.46 vs 2.03 episodes\/patient-year). The dialysate leakage and bleeding rates were comparable (13% vs 22% and 9% vs 9%). One-year catheter survival was similar in the elderly and younger patients (87.5% vs 84.0%). Although the negative CAPD selection of patients was higher in the elderly group, outcomes were similar to those seen in younger patients. Therefore, CAPD is an acceptable form of therapy for the elderly ESRD patients, particularly if a helper can participate.","808":"The purpose of our study was to determine whether albumin influenced patients' depression or whether depression influenced patients' albumin. Patients from a tertiary care university medical hospital were assessed for both serum albumin and depression [Beck Depression Inventory (BDI)] at two time points separated by 6 months. Data were collected for 72 patients (43 male, 29 female; mean age 54 years). The sample consisted of 32 hemodialysis and 40 peritoneal dialysis patients. The outcome measures were changes in depression and albumin over time. Regression analysis indicated that all three Time 1 measures of BDI, BDICOG (BDI cognitive), and BDISOM (BDI somatic) significantly predicted decreases in albumin from Time 1 to Time 2 (beta = -0.22, p &lt; 0.002; beta = -0.17, p &lt; 0.015; beta = -0.23, p &lt; 0.002, respectively). However, Time 1 measures of albumin did not predict changes in BDI, BDICOG, or BDISOM (beta = -0.04, p &lt; 0.738; beta = -0.08, p &lt; 0.375; beta = -0.07, p &lt; 0.618, respectively). Thus depression at Time 1 predicted decreases in albumin from Time 1 to Time 2. The reverse effect that albumin influences depression from Time 1 to Time 2 was not found. In conclusion, this study suggests that depression influences the nutritional status indicated by albumin levels. Thus poor nutritional status may mediate the relation between depression and mortality in end-stage renal disease (ESRD).","809":"The purpose of our study was to evaluate the adequacy of nutrition intake in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. In 34 patients, diet histories were taken every 1-3 months simultaneously with adequacy parameter estimations and total nitrogen measurements in dialysate and urine. The results were normalized to 1 kg of ideal (IBM) or lean (LBM) body mass. During the 2-year study period, there was a decrease in the intake (g\/kg IBM\/day) of carbohydrates (4.2 +\/- 1.5 vs 3.4 +\/- 1.2), fat (1.3 +\/- 0.6 vs 0.8 +\/- 0.2), and protein (1.18 +\/- 0.43 vs 0.85 +\/- 0.11); daily protein intake values were higher than those of protein catabolic rate (0.91 +\/- 0.19 vs 0.77 +\/- 0.17). Nitrogen balance was positive (6.6 +\/- 2.1 vs 1.8 +\/- 2.7 g\/day). The daily energy intake (40 +\/- 11 vs 32 +\/- 13 kcal\/kg IBM\/day) did not show any tendency of increasing or decreasing, stable or otherwise. The mean intake of vitamins and minerals (except Na, K, P) was less than in healthy persons; moreover, in most cases vitamin intake did not reach values recommended for CAPD patients. Protein, mineral, and vitamin intake is usually unsatisfactory in CAPD patients. However, a positive nitrogen balance can be obtained when the energy intake is close to the optimal value of 35 kcal\/kg\/day.","810":"Factors shown to affect serum albumin concentration in continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD) were compared between two CPD populations residing in Greece (patient n = 108) and the United States (patient n = 194). Compared to the U.S. group, the Greek CPD population had higher serum albumin levels (35.1 +\/- 4.6 vs 33.9 +\/- 5.0 g\/L, p = 0.031), was older (61.2 +\/- 12.0 vs 52.7 +\/- 16.5 years, p &lt; 0.001), and had a greater number of high or high-average peritoneal solute transport types (69.4% vs 52.1%, p = 0.003). The American CPD population had a higher number of diabetics (53.1% vs 27.8%, p &lt; 0.001), higher total Kt\/Vurea (2.06 +\/- 0.57 vs 1.93 +\/- 0.46 weekly, p = 0.046), and higher total creatinine clearance (76.3 +\/- 38.7 vs 63.4 +\/- 23.5 L\/1.73 m2 weekly, p &lt; 0.001), while normalized protein nitrogen appearance values were comparable (0.95 +\/- 0.21 in the Greeks vs 0.94 +\/- 0.22 g\/(kg x 24 hr) in the Americans, NS). A logistic regression model developed in the United States identified advanced age, diabetes, and high\/high-average peritoneal solute transport as the predictors of hypoalbuminemia (serum albumin &lt; 35 g\/L). This model generated the following areas with 95% confidence intervals (CI) under the receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve: in the Greek CPD population, ROC area 0.594 (95% CI 0.486-0.702); in the American CPD population, ROC area 0.850 (95% CI 0.810-0.890). In Greek CPD patients serum albumin appears to be affected by factors other than those identified in North America. This complicates comparisons of serum albumin, and probably morbidity and mortality, between CPD populations residing in different parts of the world.","811":"There are many studies on the performance of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in developed countries, but studies in the third world are scarce. The aim of this study is to analyze CAPD experience in the southernmost state of Brazil (Rio Grande do Sul, RS). Records were obtained from the Health Secretary of RS to assemble a cohort of all patients treated with CAPD. Another cohort study followed all patients initiating treatment for uremia in 1993 in the state capital, Porto Alegre, and compared CAPD, hemodialysis, and transplanted patients. In RS, 1316 patients (50.4% male, mean age 45.9 years) were treated in 40 CAPD programs. Despite the initial growth of the CAPD population, it subsequently leveled off. Survival was 78.6% and 40.7% in years 1 and 5, being worse for initial patients of each program, infants, and elders. Technique survival was 57.4% and 10.1% at years 1 and 5. Patients interrupting treatment for any reason had a higher chance of dropout. In Porto Alegre, 294 patients started dialysis during 1993; 21 performed CAPD, 44 had a transplant, and the others were hemodialyzed. Children were treated mostly by CAPD. CAPD patients had less diabetes and ischemic heart disease and received more transplants. Their adjusted actuarial survival (100% year 1; 67% year 3) was no different than hemodialysis. CAPD is not a popular form of renal therapy in RS, and dropout rates are significant.","812":"We assessed the impact of the introduction of a portable automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) system (Homechoice, Baxter Healthcare) on health-related quality of life (HRQOL). We evaluated HRQOL in 26 patients using the RAND 36-item Health Survey 1.0, which measures physical functioning, role limitations (physical and emotional), social functioning, emotional well-being, pain, energy, and general health perceptions. Questionnaires were administered prior to changing to the new system and 3 months later. Kt\/V and albumin levels were measured at both time points. Eight patients had been on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and 18 had been using other APD systems (PacXtra, Baxter and AMP80, Fresenius). Kt\/V increased significantly (p = 0.026); albumin was unchanged (p = 0.09). There was an improvement in the pain score (p = 0.079), although this did not reach statistical significance in the overall sample. Subgroup analysis showed that most of the improvement was from the group that had used the AMP80. No other statistically significant differences were found overall in the domains of HRQOL. Questioning of a random sample of patients indicated that perceived advantages of the new system were ease of setup and portability within the home. Neither of these translated into improvement in role-functioning domains of HRQOL. The improvement in pain score may reflect the capacity of newer cyclers to switch from drain to fill after a set proportion of dialysate has drained, leaving the patient empty for less of the time. Portable APD systems did not bring about predicted improvements in HRQOL. The HRQOL instrument may be insensitive, but technologically convenient advances may have limited impact on HRQOL due to its multifactorial nature.","813":"Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is an important mode of therapy for patients with end-stage renal disease. Although techniques and patient survival rates have improved, the psychosocial rehabilitation of Asian CAPD patients has not been studied. The aim of this study is to measure the extent of psychosocial and psychiatric morbidity in a sample of Asian CAPD patients. Patients from the outpatient CAPD facility affiliated with a tertiary care hospital were randomly selected and enrolled in the study. Demographic and clinical data were collected. Psychosocial and psychiatric assessments using the Hospital Anxiety and Depression Scale and coping style questionnaires were performed by a trained psychiatrist. The patients' most bother-some symptoms and specific worries were noted. Thirty of 105 stable CAPD patients (mean age 54.2 +\/- 14.1 years, M:F 1:2, mean duration on CAPD 22.3 +\/- 8.3 months) were studied. Twenty-one patients were married. Twenty-two patients were uneducated, 19 were unemployed, and 9 were homemakers. Based on the Hospital Anxiety and Depression scales, 50% of the patients were identified as cases of anxiety and 13% as depression. Although 93% of the patients accepted their illness, 46% of the patients were in a state of despair and hopelessness. Pruritus was the most frequent complaint (40%), followed by dietary restrictions (23%). The main worries were financial in 83% of patients, sexual dysfunction in 73%, and unemployment in 67%. In conclusion, Asian CAPD patients have a high degree of undetected psychosocial and psychiatric morbidity. These issues need to be addressed to provide adequate psychosocial rehabilitation.","814":"The purpose of the study was to describe in a cross sectional manner the self-reported level of health of a group of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients and to establish whether any clinical or laboratory variables correlated with this measure of health. While undergoing routine baseline and 6 monthly measurements of weekly total urea over volume distribution (Kt\/V) and weekly creatinine clearance (Ccr)\/1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA), 57 patients voluntarily completed the Short Form 36 health status questionnaire (SF36) (a self-report, multidimensional, generic measure of health status). Weekly Kt\/V was correlated with weekly Ccr (r = 0-81, p &lt; 0.001). Thirty-one of the 57 patients were recorded as having Ccr &lt; 65 L\/week. A comparison with Australian interim normative data demonstrated that this group of CAPD patients reported lower scores on the eight physical and mental health components that are measured by the SF36 than did the general population. Patients who were most impaired in their physical functioning were more likely to be older, overweight, and to have a lower normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR). Patients who were adequately dialyzed (Ccr &gt; or = 65 L\/week\/1.73 m2) reported greater vitality than those patients recorded as having Ccr &lt; 65 L\/week\/1.73 m2.","815":"Previous studies by our group have attempted to examine quality of life (QoL) issues in a cohort of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients maintained on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) by assessing a variety of psychological tests and by asking patients to rate their own QoL. The present study was undertaken to extend previous observations by asking patients to spontaneously select those domains of life experience that they think are most important in determining their quality of life. Sixty-eight medically stable CPD patients were asked to spontaneously select those three to five domains felt to be most important to them in defining their QoL. The 307 responses were then grouped into 22 broad categories by three investigators. The most frequently selected domains focused on interpersonal relationships. Domains that enhance the quality of one's day and add meaning to one's life were selected with a midrange frequency. Some domains that might intuitively seem to be important for a patient's QoL were selected with a surprisingly low frequency. These findings suggest that to understand what CPD patients value in assessing their QoL can best be determined by asking them directly and not by using predetermined variables.","816":"Patient dropout from chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) and transfer to hemodialysis remains a major problem with patients on CPD. Peritonitis, exit-site infections, and medical complications requiring hospitalization often adversely affect the outcome of CPD. The role of psychosocial factors in determining patient outcome and influencing the rates of these complications is not clear. Our group has employed a variety of instruments, including the Patient Related Anxiety Scale (PRAS), Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI), Kupfer-Detre System II somatic symptom scale (KDS-II), and a patient self-assessed quality of life (PAQOL) questionnaire to assess quality of life and to objectively evaluate the psychosocial status of the patient treated with CPD. The present study extends previous observations by relating the results of these psychosocial instruments to the incidence of various complications in 103 patients maintained on CPD. Patients were divided into low-scoring (lowest symptoms of depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and best quality of life evaluation), intermediate, and high-scoring (highest symptoms of depression, anxiety, somatic symptoms, and worst quality of life) categories. The peritonitis rates, exit-site infection rates, and days of hospitalization of the three categories were then compared. The results demonstrate significantly higher complication rates in the high-scoring when compared to the low-scoring patients. Thus screening patients maintained on CPD with objective measures of psychosocial functioning may enable caregivers to more accurately predict which patients are at greater risk for developing medical complications.","817":"The aim of this study was to design a concise, focused questionnaire to measure individuals' perceptions of the impact of their renal condition on their quality of life, taking account of the importance of life domains relevant for the individual. The design of the renal-dependent quality of life (RDQoL) questionnaire was based on that of the Audit of Diabetes Dependent Quality of Life (ADDQoL) diabetes-specific individualized quality of life questionnaire, which was influenced by patient-centered principles underlying the interview method of McGee et al. The questionnaires specify life domains, and the respondents rate personally applicable domains for the importance and impact of the renal condition. Observation in eight U.K. renal clinics, together with 40 in-depth interviews with peritoneal dialysis, hemodialysis, and transplant patients, provided the basis for item selection for the RDQoL. The results of the study were as follows: each of the 13 ADDQoL items was relevant and important for renal patients. Additional suggestions for items included physical appearance, dependency, freedom, restrictions of fluid intake, and societal prejudice. In conclusion, unlike other quality of life measures, the RDQoL is an individualized questionnaire measure of the impact of renal disease and its treatment on quality of life. Face and content validity is established for adult renal patients, and the RDQoL is being further evaluated for research and clinical use.","818":"There is a great variation in erythropoietin (rHuEPO) requirements in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Although some studies show the importance of higher iron saturation (FeS, &gt; 20%) in hemodialysis patients for a maximal rHuEPO response, data on PD patients are scarce. We followed 38 stable PD patients for 5 months to evaluate the factors that may be responsible for variability in rHuEPO response. All patients received oral iron supplement and erythropoietin subcutaneously twice a week and were divided into three groups according to weekly rHuEPO dose (U\/kg): Group I, &lt; 50; Group II, 50-100; Group III, &gt; 100. Hematocrit was maintained at a currently accepted level of 30%-36%. Iron saturation levels were 30.4 +\/- 2%, 27.7 +\/- 2.5%, and 21.7 +\/- 2.5%, and rHuEPO doses were 37.3 +\/- 2.4, 71.2 +\/- 2.3, and 141.5 +\/- 9.7 in Groups I, II, and III, respectively. There were no significant differences in age, sex, etiology of renal failure, parathyroid hormone, serum albumin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), and creatinine between various groups. These data suggest that rHuEPO requirements are lower in PD patients with higher FeS. FeS may be a good indicator of rHuEPO requirement and responsiveness in PD patients. Achieving higher FeS than the currently accepted 20% may further decrease rHuEPO requirements in PD patients and have significant cost implications.","819":"Some chronic renal failure patients respond poorly to recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO). In continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, such a poor response may indicate inadequate dialysis or low body iron stores. To correct iron deficiency, once-a-week intravenous iron supplementation is recommended. However, hemodialysis patients receive iron supplements three times a week. This study was designed to compare the efficacy of iron supplementation between once-weekly and twice-weekly regimens. In both groups, rHuEPO doses were similar. Seventeen CAPD patients were studied. All had hemoglobin levels less than 10 g\/dL. Ten patients were given 100 mg intravenous iron once weekly, and 7 were given 50 mg intravenous iron twice weekly until a total iron dose of 600 mg was achieved (stage I). The patients were crossed over to receive another 600 mg iron (stage II). Hematocrit increased significantly in patients receiving twice-a-week iron supplementation (+3.8% and 6%) compared to those receiving once-a-week iron supplementation (+1.3% and 1.4%) during stages I and II. The ferritin levels were not different between the groups. In conclusion, rHuEPO is more effective when administered with intravenous iron.","820":"The records of 734 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients trained at our center between January 1983 and December 1991 were reviewed, and those who had been on PD more than 5 years were selected to study the characteristics common to long-term survivors. We obtained the following results: 22 patients (3%) remained on PD for more than 5 years and 6 patients for more than 8 years (0.8%). Of these, 59.1% were males and 55% white with a mean age of 41.3 +\/- 15.1 years and weight 71.1 +\/- 14.7 kg. The causes of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) were: diabetes 31.8%, glomerulonephritis 36.4%, and nephrosclerosis 22.7%. The average peritonitis rate was 0.46 episodes\/year and hospitalization 4.13 +\/- 3.70 days\/ year. After 3 years of PD all patients were essentially anuric. The mean 4-hour D\/Purea = 0.94 +\/- 0.01 and D\/Pcreatinine = 0.68 +\/- 0.03. Weekly Kpt\/Vurea improved from 1.61 to 1.82, Kcreatinine from 40 to 45 L\/1.73 m2, and dialysate volume from 11.6 to 14.1 L\/day. The normalized catabolic protein rate (NPCR) remained stable at 0.7 g\/kg\/day. Serum albumin concentrations (SACs) averaged 3.5 g\/dL and did not show a trend with time. Weights revealed marked variation with a mean group gain of 3.4 +\/- 0.85 kg. Social support was excellent in 19 patients, and 20 were very compliant. Thirteen patients remain on PD, 4 expired, 1 received a transplant, and 4 transferred to hemodialysis. In conclusion, PD can maintain life for prolonged periods of time in the absence of renal function. Longterm survivors are typically of average size, enjoy stable and average peritoneal transport, good social support, remain compliant with therapy, and experience infrequent peritonitis. New PD modalities capable of delivering higher doses and adjustment of prescription based on residual renal function, peritoneal transport, and metabolic needs should increase the proportion of long-term survivors.","821":"Very few patients have undergone long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD). We report a case of a female patient on PD since 26 May 1979. Suffering from malignant hypertension, she developed renal failure in April 1979. The renal biopsy showed a severe vascular nephropathy. She was 50 years old, her body weight (BW) was 45 kg, and her height was 1.49 m. She refused hemodialysis. A Tenckhoff catheter was installed, and 12-hour intermittent PD (IPD), three times a week, was started in the dialysis center. Ten months later, she began nightly home IPD. In March 1985 she started continuous ambulatory PD (CAPD); she was nearly anuric. During the following years, she developed renal osteodystrophy and suffered from repeated hyperparathyroidism requiring multiple surgical interventions, osteomalacia, pseudotumoral calcinosis, and, finally, adynamic bone disease. She is now 67.5 years old, her BW is 34 kg, and she is still using CAPD. This patient has the same Tenckhoff catheter. She never developed peritonitis or an exit-site or tunnel infection. She used acetate dialysis solution for nearly six years and then lactate solution. Presently her peritoneal permeability is of the high-average type; dialysis adequacy (weekly Kt\/V: 2.15, weekly peritoneal clearance: 58 L\/1.73 m2) as well as nutritional parameters are satisfactory. She has moderate anemia without erythropoietin treatment. She maintains a good quality of life. Although the patient lost 11 kg in 17 years, she has maintained good nutritional status. Dialysis adequacy could be achieved despite anuria for more than 11 years. Small body size, absence of infection and catheter-related problems, healthy peritoneal membrane, good acceptance of the technique, and vigilance towards dietary habits may be the keys for satisfactory long-term PD.","822":"This prospective nonrandomized study enrolled 16 patients with congestive heart failure [NYHA (New York Heart Association) III and IV] refractory to a maximal well-tolerated drug therapy. The aims were to evaluate if peritoneal ultrafiltration (PUF) could improve clinical conditions and to determine morbidity secondary to resistant congestive heart failure (RCHF) and PUF. There were 16 patients (12 male, 4 female) with a mean age of 65.4 years (56-81 years) and follow-up of 15.6 months (4-33 months). Thirteen patients had RCHF without end-stage renal disease. Patients were classified as NYHA class IV (n = 11) or class III (n = 5). One anuric patient had been on previous hemodialysis and switched to APD. PUF was obtained with a 2-L hypertonic dialysis solution, once a day (n = 7) or every 2 days (n = 4). Clinical improvement was obtained for all the patients. Weight decreased from 72.2 to 66.7 kg with a weekly ultrafiltration of 3.74 L (2.2-6.5 L). Sodium removal was 79 mmol\/day (urinary 43%, peritoneal transport 57%). During the follow-up period, 2 patients received a cardiac transplant since 7 died due to cardiac reasons. Mean hospitalization time was 4.4 and 1.20 per patient per day before and after PUF, respectively. Hospitalization was in keeping with either RCHF (36%), dialysis complications (16%), or miscellaneous causes (48%). Our experience showed that a functional improvement and a better quality of life were achieved for all these patients with a low rate of hospitalization.","823":"Sleep apnea is a surprisingly common disorder in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) and chronic renal failure. The symptoms of sleep apnea frequently go unreported or may be misdiagnosed as uremia, depression, chronic illness, or insomnia. A review of the literature was performed to define the prevalence, morbidity, and treatment of sleep apnea syndrome in the ESRD patient. Sleep apnea occurs in at least 60% of ESRD patients. The known complications of sleep apnea include arrhythmias, pulmonary hypertension, and systemic hypertension. In addition, sleep apnea has been implicated in coronary artery disease and strokes. The contribution of sleep apnea to the high mortality from cardiac disease and stroke in peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis patients is unknown. The causes of the increased prevalence of sleep apnea in ESRD patients are unknown and likely differ from the general population, but the treatment is similar. The literature suggests that modality of renal replacement therapy does not matter; however, large nocturnal volume peritoneal dialysis may worsen sleep apnea. Renal transplantation may be curative. In conclusion, sleep apnea may be an under-diagnosed disease in patients on dialysis. There are significant reasons to suspect that sleep apnea may worsen the morbidity and mortality of ESRD, and there are potential successful therapies.","824":"Advances in peritoneal dialysis (PD) technology and better understanding of peritoneal solute transport have expanded the application of this therapy to a larger segment of the end-stage renal disease (ESRD) community. However, adequate patient selection remains an important issue in assuring success of this therapy. Many of the causes for high technique failure with PD can be traced back to poor initial patient selection. The success of PD depends on: (1) the patient's general health and preexisting comorbid conditions, (2) the patient's ability to provide self-dialysis or to procure an adequate partner, and (3) matching therapy to the patient's individual needs.","825":"It has recently been suggested that sonophoresis, or the application of ultrasound (US) in the kilohertz range, could enhance peritoneal mass transport. To examine this hypothesis, six nephrectomized rabbits were exposed to ultrasound while under isoflurane anesthesia. An additional five also had bilateral nephrectomies and were used as a control group. Each group underwent four exchanges of 90 minutes duration with 1.5% dextrose while anesthetized. Dialysate samples were taken at 0, 30, 60, and 90 minutes and assayed for urea, creatinine, glucose, and protein. Blood samples were taken pre- and postexchange. In the US group, 20 kHz ultrasound was applied during exchanges 2 and 3 at 47.5 W and 95 W, respectively, using a Virsonic 475 cell disrupter acoustically coupled to the abdomen through a water column and gel-coated PVC membrane. Results were analyzed by calculating the mass transfer area coefficient (MTAC) and 90-minute D\/P values for each exchange. No significant differences were observed in the absolute means of either parameter between the control and US groups. However, when exchanges 2 to 4 were normalized with respect to exchange 1, the resulting urea D\/P means were less for the US exchanges compared to the control (p &lt; 0.05). This suggests a possible decrease in transport through US application.","826":"The intrinsic permeability of the peritoneal membrane can be functionally represented by the restriction coefficient (RC). The RC can be calculated as the exponent of the power relation between the mass transfer area coefficients (MTACs) of various solutes and their free diffusion coefficients in water. When the RC = 1.0, transport is determined by free diffusion only, as is expected for low molecular weight (LMW) solutes. A RC &gt; 1.0 suggests that transport is restricted by the peritoneal membrane in a size-selective way, as has been found previously for macromolecules (MM). RCLMW can be calculated using the MTACs of urea, creatinine, urate, and beta 2-microglobulin, whereas RCMM can be calculated from clearances of beta 2-microglobulin, albumin, IgG, and alpha 2-macroglobulin. RCLMW and RCMM were determined in 108 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. In 36 patients, 3 or more (range 3-13) observations for RCLMW during a period of at least 2 years were available. RCMM were analyzed when present in the same patients. The median cross sectional values (n = 108) were: RCLMW: 1.22 (range 0.75-2.18) and RCMM: 2.30 (range 1.86-3.27). RCLMW was not correlated with time on PD, neither cross sectionally (r = -0.07, NS) nor after analysis of trend (mean regression coefficient t = 0.26, SD = 0.07). For RCMM a positive correlation with duration of PD was demonstrated (cross sectionally r = -0.18, p = 0.02, analysis of trend: t = 2.27, SD = 0.11, n = 27). Both RCs were not interrelated (r = -0.18, NS). The absence of a relation between both RCs suggests that LMW solutes and MM are transported by different pathways. The mean value of 1.22 for the RCLMW illustrates that the transport of LMW solutes is mainly by free diffusion, through the small-pore system. MM, which have to pass through the large-pore system, are restricted by the peritoneal membrane in a size-selective way, as shown by the high value of the RCMM. The lack of a correlation between the RCLMW and duration of PD indicates that no systematic changes occur in the small pores of the peritoneal vessels. In contrast, the increase of RCMM with duration of PD suggests restrictive changes at the level of the large-pore system.","827":"The efficiency of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) depends on the permeability of the peritoneal membrane. Peritoneal fibrosis (PF) causes the loss of dialytic function. Several studies have indicated that PF is closely related to the proliferation of peritoneal fibroblasts and the deposition of extracellular matrix (ECM). Transforming growth factor beta 1 (TGF beta 1) plays a major role in stimulating ECM deposition. Frequent peritonitis occurrence may cause persistent TGF beta 1 mRNA expression. In an attempt to search for a factor related to PF, we designed a longitudinal study to measure TGF beta 1 levels in dialysate and TGF beta 1 mRNA expression in peritoneal mononuclear cells (PMNCs) from peritoneal dialysate before, at the onset of and once a week during peritonitis and after peritonitis in patients with high peritonitis occurrence (HPO) and patients with low peritonitis occurrence (LPO). Fifteen patients with a LPO rate and 5 patients with a HPO rate were followed up longitudinally. Meanwhile, TGF beta 1 levels and TGF beta 1 mRNA expression were augmented in peritoneal dialytic fluid before, during, and after the episodes of peritonitis. Peritoneal permeability was evaluated by the peritoneal equilibration test (PET). The results revealed that in the LPO group, TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 1 mRNA were detectable at early stages of peritonitis, but the levels decreased rapidly and were undetectable 2 weeks after peritonitis. On the other hand, in the HPO group, TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 1 mRNA persisted for a long time. We could detect TGF beta 1 and TGF beta 1 mRNA in dialytic fluid and PMNCs even 2, 3, and 4 weeks after episodes of peritonitis. When compared with that of the first or second episode of peritonitis, peritoneal function evaluated with the PET was found to obviously deteriorate at the third episode of peritonitis. These findings were confirmed by an in situ hybridization technique to evaluate the relationship between TGF beta 1 mRNA expression and PF from biopsied peritoneal specimens. These findings suggest that the high TGF beta 1 levels in the dialysate are related to an increased expression of TGF beta 1 in the peritoneum. Persistent TGF beta 1 expression in the peritoneum may serve as a useful parameter in predicting PF in CAPD patients with frequent peritonitis occurrence.","828":"Hyaluronan (HA) plays an important role in peritoneal tissue remodeling and the inflammatory process. In this study, attention was directed to the effects of various osmotic agents on HA synthesis in human peritoneal mesothelial cells (HMCs) and fibroblasts (HFBs). Following incubation with growth arrest media for 48 hours, the cells (4 x 10(4)\/mL) were incubated for 72 hours in media at various concentrations (50, 100 mmol\/L for crystalloid agents and 3.5%, 7% for oncotic agents) of glucose, mannitol, glycerol, sucrose, raffinose, NaCl, combined amino acids, maltodextrin, dextran 70, and hydroxyethylstarch 20. HA synthesis for 72 hours was measured by sandwich-binding protein assay. HMCs synthesized approximately 0.15 ng\/cell\/72 hours and HFBs 0.09 ng. All crystalloid osmotic agents significantly suppressed HA synthesis by HMCs and HFBs in a concentration-dependent manner. There was no such suppression by any oncotic osmotic agent, which, to the contrary, enhanced the synthesis by 6%-63% in HMCs. In conclusion, HMCs and HFBs may be considered sources of HA in the peritoneal dialysis effluent. Crystalloid osmotic agents suppressed HA synthesis in these cells. Oncotic osmotic agents seem to be less toxic in this regard.","829":"Advanced glycation end products (AGEs) have been noted in the peritoneal tissue of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, and this may cause an increase in membrane permeability. In vivo and in vitro kinetic analysis was carried out on furosine and pentosidine, early and late glycation products. Plasma furosine and pentosidine were measured by HPLC in patients with renal dysfunction with or without diabetes mellitus (DM) and dialysate pentosidine and furosine in CAPD patients. Only those dialysis patients without residual renal function were used in this study. Plasma furosine was remarkably high in DM, hemodialysis (HD), and CAPD patients. Plasma pentosidine appeared to depend on renal function and was not influenced by diabetic condition. Plasma pentosidine was significantly higher in CAPD than HD patients. A weak positive correlation was noted between dialysate and plasma furosine and pentosidine, indicating the main source of furosine and pentosidine in PD effluent to be plasma. Serial dialysate sampling showed furosine and pentosidine to increase linearly. Mean dialysate\/plasma (D\/P) of furosine and pentosidine were 0.043 and 0.012, respectively. Protein-bound product size and in situ formation of furosine in the peritoneal cavity would be the reason for these differences in D\/P. In situ formation of early glycation products in the peritoneal cavity may be concluded to take place in CAPD patients, and high plasma pentosidine may lead to its accumulation in tissue, resulting, possibly, in pathological change.","830":"The effects of extracorporeal (urinary plus peritoneal) losses of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF-I) and insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) on their respective serum levels were studied in 10 adult patients (aged 42-74 years) with end-stage renal failure and residual renal function of 0-4.5 mL\/min. All patients had been on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for a period of 2-27 months. Morning serum, 24-hour urine, and 8-hour overnight peritoneal concentrations of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 were measured by radioimmuno- (Incstar) and immunoradiometric (Active) assays. CAPD patients showed extracorporeal losses (mean +\/- SEM) of 118.7 +\/- 10.6 micrograms (urinary 6.4 +\/- 2.8 and peritoneal 112.3 +\/- 8.5 micrograms) of IGF-I\/24 hour and 1.5 +\/- 0.1 mg (urinary 0.2 +\/- 0.1 mg and peritoneal 1.3 +\/- 0.1 mg) of IGFBP-3\/24 hour. Extracorporeal losses of IGF-I accounted for about 4% of the daily production rate of this polypeptide, and the peritoneal and urinary concentrations of IGFBP-3 did not exceed 4% and 14%, respectively, of their serum levels. Serum concentrations of IGF-I (227.7 +\/- 64.2 micrograms\/L) and IGFBP-3 (5.3 +\/- 2.4 mg\/L) were not significantly correlated with extracorporeal, peritoneal, or urinary losses of these proteins or with residual renal function. We suggest that extracorporeal losses of IGF-I and IGFBP-3 in adult patients on CAPD do not influence their serum levels and that IGF-I may therefore be used as a marker of malnutrition.","831":"This study was designed to test the morphological and functional effects of neutral, bicarbonate-based peritoneal dialysis solution containing glycylglycine on the peritoneum of chronically dialyzed rats. Peritoneal dialysis catheters were implanted in 36 rats. The animals were dialyzed twice daily for 4 weeks with a solution containing bicarbonate (35 mmol\/L), glycylglycine (10 mmol\/L), and 4% of anhydrous glucose (pH 7.35) (group 1; n = 18) or with lactate-based standard 4.25% Dianeal (pH 5.3 (group 2; n = 18). At the beginning of the study, reabsorption of glucose was slower in group 1 (p &lt; 0.02); at the same time, the hyaluronic acid level in the effluent was higher in this group (p &lt; 0.05). However, towards the end of the study these differences disappeared. After 4 weeks of dialysis in rats exposed to bicarbonate-based solution only, the transperitoneal loss of proteins was slower. In morphological studies of the parietal peritoneum, we detected no statistically significant differences between control nondialyzed rats and those exposed to tested solutions. In a biopsy of visceral peritoneum a tendency was observed for increased thickness of peritoneum in rats dialyzed with both tested peritoneal dialysis solutions when compared to control animals. In conclusion, neutral pH glycylglycine peritoneal dialysis solutions seem to be more biocompatible than standard dialysis solutions.","832":"The relative contribution of urinary volume (UV) and urine-to-plasma concentration ratios for urea (U\/PUr) and creatinine (U\/PCr) to urinary Kt\/V urea (Kt\/VU) and urinary uncorrected creatinine clearance (CCrU), respectively, was studied by simple and multiple linear regression analysis in 236 urea kinetic studies and 233 creatinine kinetic studies performed in 135 patients on continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD). The following simple regressions were obtained: Kt\/VU = 0.09 + 0.72 (UV), r = 0.75; Kt\/VU = -0.01 + 0.11 (U\/PUr), r = 0.55; CCrU = 12.06 + 56.46 + 46.46 (UV), r = 0.62; CCrU = 3.51 + 3.40 (U\/PCr), r = 0.58. All r values were significant (p &lt; 0.001). According to these regressions, a loss of 0.2 L\/24 hours in UV leads to a loss of 0.15 weekly in Kt\/VU and 11.3 L\/1.73 m2 weekly in corrected CCrU (approximately 8 L\/1.73 m2 weekly in corrected CCrU). By multiple linear regression, (1) Kt\/VU = -0.38 + 0.70 (UV) + 0.10 (U\/PUr). Standardized coefficients were 0.72 for UV and 0.51 for U\/PUr (2) CCrU = -33.36 + 59.83 (UV) + 3.63 (U\/PCr). Standardized coefficients were 0.65 for UV and 0.61 for U\/PCr. UV is the most important determinant of both urea and creatinine urinary clearances in CPD patients. The contribution of the U\/P ratios to the urinary clearances is important, but less than that of UV. The primary dependence of urinary clearances on UV allows the use of UV, which can be easily monitored by patients, as a first approximation index of changing residual renal function in CPD.","833":"Stepwise logistic regression performed in 324 clearance studies in 194 patients identified daily drain volume normalized by body water (DV\/V) and peritoneal solute transport type as the predictors of peritoneal creatinine clearance (CCrp) in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Solution of the regression model for DV\/V provided DV\/V values predicted to provide a desired CCrp at different probabilities. The ability of the predicted DV\/V to detect desired CCrp values was tested in a new set of 359 clearance studies in 217 CAPD patients who had a peritoneal equilibration test within 12 months of the clearance study. No patient with low transport had a CCrp exceeding 54 L\/1.73 m2 weekly. The following DV\/V values detected CCr &gt; or = 54 L\/1.73 m2 weekly with a probability of at least 80%: for low-average transport, 0.406 L\/L per 24 hours; for high-average transport, 0.339 L\/L per 24 hours; for high transport, 0.241 L\/L per 24 hours. Corresponding DV\/V values for a CCrp of 60 L\/1.73 m2 weekly were as follows: for high-average transport, 0.351 L\/L per 24 hours; for high transport, 0.271 L\/L per 24 hours. For high-average transport, maximal body surface area (BSA) estimates allowing a CCrp of 60 L\/1.73 m2 weekly at a CAPD schedule of four daily exchanges with 3-L exchange volume and 1.5 L\/24 hour ultrafiltration volume, and with the specified DV\/V values were 2.03 m2 in women and 1.77 m2 in men. Corresponding BSA estimates for high peritoneal solute transport were 2.58 m2 in women and 2.21 m2 in men. The delivered dose of CAPD, expressed as DV\/V, required to achieve a target CCrp can be calculated from multivariate statistical models taking into account the peritoneal solute transport type. Multiplication of the required DV\/V by V provides an estimate of the required daily exchange volume. Maximal BSA estimates allowing a target CCrp can be calculated for each gender and peritoneal solute transport type.","834":"Loss of transcapillary ultrafiltration (TCUF) can occur during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and may be caused by exposure to the high glucose concentrations in the dialysate, leading to glycation of water channels in the endothelial cells of the peritoneal microvessels. If this hypothesis is correct, diabetic patients should have lower TCUF rates at the onset of CAPD than nondiabetic controls. Such a difference should disappear during longer-duration CAPD because of the continuous glucose exposure in both groups, induced by the high glucose concentrations in the dialysate. Therefore, the standard peritoneal permeability analysis of 11 diabetic (mean age 48 years, range 33-70 years) and 11 nondiabetic patients (mean age 49 years, range 36-69 years) matched for sex, age, and duration of CAPD were studied shortly after the onset of CAPD treatment (mean duration 162 vs 131 days) and one year later. No differences were found in solute transport or protein clearances between the two groups at the onset of CAPD. The TCUF rate was lower in the diabetic patients: 0.9 mL\/min (0.09-2.25) versus 1.51 mL\/min (0.97-2.44), p = 0.01. The other parameters of fluid transport were not different. The mean osmotic pressure gradient, exerted by albumin and glucose, was 1.72 mmHg in the diabetic patients and 5.44 mmHg in the controls (p = 0.0004). No differences were found in peritoneal permeability, including TCUF, after one year between the two groups. In conclusion, the TCUF rate was lower in diabetic patients compared to nondiabetics only shortly after the onset of CAPD. These results suggest that long-term exposure to high glucose concentrations in diabetics prior to CAPD may cause changes in capillary wall aquaporins, similar to long-term exposure to high glucose concentrations in the dialysate in CAPD.","835":"The viability of long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD), especially once residual renal function is lost, has been challenged since recently recommended weekly targets of Kt\/V of 2.1 and creatine clearance (Ccr) of 70 L\/1.73 m2 may be difficult to reach. This study demonstrates the theoretical possibility of achieving these targets in PD patients even without residual renal function. A 6-hour dwell study was performed in 68 PD patients with frequent dialysate and plasma sampling using 2 L of 1.36% (n = 13), 2.27% (n = 9), or 3.86% glucose dialysate (n = 46) with 131I albumin as an intraperitoneal volume marker. Alterations in fluid balance, Kt\/V, and Ccr with dwell time (t) as well as the impact of peritoneal fluid absorption on peritoneal fluid and solute removal were evaluated. Kt\/V and Ccr did not follow an exponential function with t and, in fact, decreased after 4-5 hours, especially in high transporters. All patients could achieve either weekly Kt\/V (especially low transporters) or Ccr target (especially high transporters) if they are treated with automated PD. Calculations showed that eliminating fluid absorption could increase mean fluid removal by 43%-179%, increase mean Kt\/V by 17%-32%, and mean Ccr by 16%-30% (depending on the solution used and the patient's peritoneal transport pattern) during a 6-hour dialysis exchange. We reached the following conclusions: (1) Kt\/V(urea) and Ccr are markedly time-dependent during a single exchange due to the substantial impact of peritoneal absorption and may, in fact, decline after 4 hours, especially in high transporters. (2) Extrapolating Kt\/V and Ccr values from short dwell times [i.e., peritoneal equilibration test (PET) results] to long dwell times will overestimate the peritoneal clearances. (3) Enough fluid removal must be considered as an important target of adequate dialysis along with small solute clearances. (4) If fluid absorption could be eliminated, most continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients could achieve the recommended Kt\/V and\/or Ccr targets even without residual renal function.","836":"Loss of peritoneal mesothelial cells and decrease of mesothelial cell mass have been described in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Longitudinal follow-up in individual PD patients cannot be performed by serial peritoneal biopsies. Markers of mesothelial integrity, measured in the effluent, may therefore be a valuable approach to detect changes in the mesothelium in vivo. In the present study, markers that are known to be produced by mesothelial cells were followed in individual patients: cancer antigen 125 (CA125), phospholipids (PHL), and hyaluronan (HA). CA125 is considered to be a reflection of mesothelial cell mass or stable mesothelial cell turnover. Appearance rates (AR) were determined in the effluents of 30 PD patients on a yearly basis. Median AR (range) were: CA125: 111 U\/min (10-610), PHL: 15 mg\/min (3-46), HA: 666 mg\/min (135-6200). Cross sectionally, the AR for CA125 was negatively related to duration of PD (r = -0.47, p &lt; 0.0001) and weakly related to peritonitis incidence (r = -0.20, p &lt; 0.05). Patients treated with PD for more than 4 years had lower CA125 appearance than patients treated less than 4 years (p &lt; 0.0004). HA was also related to the incidence of peritonitis, but positively (r = 0.32, p &lt; 0.004). PHL were not related to either parameter. A significant negative trend with time of PD treatment was observed for CA125 only [mean regression coefficient (t) -3.75, SD 1.2]. No trend in time of PD treatment could be detected for HA and PHL. These data indicate a gradual loss of mesothelial cell mass during PD by the decrease of CA125 with time. The lack of a decrease in HA and its positive relation to incidence of peritonitis suggest an additional release of HA by cells other than the mesothelial cells, such as fibroblasts and leukocytes. Alternatively, an activation of (mesothelial) cells with duration of PD and possibly with increased peritonitis incidence cannot be excluded. The relation between PHL and duration of PD suggested by others was not confirmed in this study. PHL are probably released by a number of different cells, and therefore changes in PHL cannot be used as a reflection of changes in mesothelial cell mass. It is concluded that CA125 is the most specific marker for the follow-up of mesothelial cell mass in vivo.","837":"To understand the mechanism of regeneration of the mesothelial cell in a high permeable state, in vitro experiments with cultured mesothelial cells were carried out using a type I collagen-coated multititer plate. Prior to cell seeding, each plate was filled with 100 microL of glucose solution at concentrations of 30 mmol\/L, 90 mmol\/L, and 150 mmol\/L, and minimum essential medium (MEM), respectively. After immersion for one to five weeks at 37 degrees C, mesothelial cells were seeded at a density of 3 x 10(4)\/cm2, then glucose was added at varying final concentrations between 0 and 150 mmol\/L and\/or albumin was added at a final concentration of 2 g\/dL. After days 2 and 4, DNA synthesis was measured by incorporation of 5-bromo-2'-deoxy-uridine (BrdU). There was no significant difference of DNA synthesis between groups with and without one-week glucose immersion when mesothelial cells were cultured with only 10% FCS\/MEM. However, suppression of DNA synthesis at 2 g\/dL of albumin was seen no matter what concentration of glucose supplement was used. Without a high concentration of albumin, DNA synthesis was dose-dependent on glucose. The longer the immersion period, the lesser the suppression. It is speculated that process of glycation with collagen may relate to growth of mesothelial cells.","838":"Recent studies have emphasized the role of peritoneal mesothelial cell (PMC) in peritoneal immune defense mechanisms in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The aim of this study was to evaluate a possible relationship between peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE), cytokine (Cy) levels, and PMC viability and their impact on peritonitis morbidity. Fifteen patients initiating CAPD for end-stage renal failure participated in the study. The following parameters were evaluated: (1) the levels of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta), tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma), interleukin-6 (IL-6), and interleukin-8 (IL-8) in PDE samples taken 7 days after initiating CAPD, at the end of the first, third, and sixth month of CAPD (determined by a solid phase enzyme amplified sensitivity immunoassay EASIA); (2) peritoneal mesothelial cell viability [determined by the release of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and by trypan blue extrusion test] by isolating and culturing peritoneal mesothelial cells at the moment of the placement of the peritoneal catheter and at the sixth month of CAPD; (3) peritonitis incidence during the 24 months after starting CAPD. At the first month of CAPD in all patients there was a slight increase in PDE IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha levels, while other Cy were almost undetectable. Time course studies showed that in 10 patients (Group I) there was a significant increase in PDE levels of IL-6, IL-8, and INF-gamma (p &lt; 0.0005) in comparison to other Cy and a good PMC viability. In the other 5 patients (Group II) there were higher PDE levels of IL-1 beta and TNF-alpha (p &lt; 0.0005). This was associated with a marked reduction in PMC viability determined by the release of LDH and by the trypan blue extrusion test. During the 24 months after starting CAPD, incidence of peritonitis was one episode per 24 patient-months in Group I and one episode per 9.2 patient-months in Group II. Our results show that from the beginning of CAPD there are distinct patterns of Cy in the PDE that correlate with a different PMC viability and peritonitis morbidity. Thus the analysis of the above-mentioned parameters may be useful in the early identification of the risk of peritonitis, thus allowing preventive measures.","839":"To clarify the mechanism of water transport driven by osmotic gradient through \"ultrasmall pores\" in the peritoneum, we tried to identify water channels in the peritoneum and cells in the peritoneal dialysate. Peritoneum was surgically excised from uremic patients at the insertion or removal of a catheter. Sediment was collected from 2 L of peritoneal dialysate by centrifugation at 1500 rpm. RNA was extracted and amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Contamination of reticulocytes was tested by the presence of ankyrin mRNA. Peritoneal tissue expressed aquaporin (AQP) 1, 3, and 4 (AQP1 &gt; 3 &gt; 4). Sediment of dialysate expressed mRNA of AQP1 and AQP3 (AQP1 &gt; AQP3). The sample did not express ankyrin mRNA, indicating that the AQP1 in the sediment did not originate from reticulocytes. These data indicate that aquaporins are present in the peritoneum and might participate in water transport. Further quantitative analysis of aquaporin messages in the dialysate might clarify the pathogenesis of water removal failure.","840":"","841":"As a result of the theoretical risk of an excessive increase in intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) in association with peritoneal dialysis, reduction of instilled intraperitoneal dialysate volume (IPV) is often proposed in infants compared to adults; a further reduction is often noted in neonates compared to children. To better evaluate the significance of this risk, we have tested the relationship between the IPP (cm of water) and the IPV (mL\/m2) in our population of children on peritoneal dialysis (n = 17) during the last three years. IPP was measured after a nocturnal dialysis session, during a morning study day, after sequential exchanges of ten minutes' dwell time each, with progressively increased instilled dialysate volumes from 600 to 1400 mL\/m2. Mean IPP values were 8.2 +\/- 3.8 cm for a mean IPV of 990 +\/- 160 mL\/m2 body surface area. These values are lower than the IPP values established for adults (13.4 +\/- 3.1 cm), which were given for higher IPV values of 1585 +\/- 235 mL\/m2. The relationship between IPP and IPV was age-dependent. In neonates, stable IPP values (3.5 +\/- 1.6 cm) were noted for IPV from 600 to 800 mL\/m2; thereafter, increasing IPV led to an increase in IPP. In the range of 600 to 1200 mL\/m2 IPV, no significant increment of mean IPP was noted in infants (4.8 +\/- 2.6 cm) and in children (9.6 +\/- 2.1 cm). However, increasing the dialysate volume over 1000 mL\/m2 induced an overincrement of the individual IPP value in most cases, and the rise of IPP was substantial when IPV rose from 1200 to 1400 mL\/m2.","842":"We performed 22 nitrogen balance (NB) studies of three days' duration in 19 children (8.7 +\/- 3.8 years) on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) for 19.4 +\/- 16.4 months. The dietary intakes were assessed by the double weighing method. Total nitrogen, protein, urea, and creatinine were analyzed in the dialysate and urine collected daily. Total nitrogen was also determined in the feces collected over the whole NB study period, using vegetable charcoal as a marker. The protein intake was 1.64 +\/- 0.50 g\/kg\/day, corresponding to 126 +\/- 40% of the recommended daily allowance (RDA) for normal children of the same age, and the calorie intake (diet+glucose from dialysate) reached 75 +\/- 26% of RDA. Nitrogen losses were: 0.177 +\/- 0.052 g\/kg\/day with peritoneal fluid and urine, and 0.028 +\/- 0.018 g\/kg\/day with feces. The NB, positive in 17 out of 22 studies, ranged from -116 to +167 mg\/kg\/day (mean 44.0 +\/- 66.2 mg\/kg\/day). A direct and significant correlation between NB and nitrogen intake (g\/kg\/day) (r = 0.562, p &lt; 0.05) and total calorie intake (cal\/kg\/day) (r = 0.483, p &lt; 0.05) has been observed. These data confirm the need to ensure in children on CPD an adequate nutritional intake, and further support the efforts to improve calorie intake.","843":"Previous studies on the peritoneal immune system described the presence of activated T lymphocytes in peritoneal effluents (PE) from patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD), and showed that mesothelial cells (MC) can present antigens to T cells. In order to better define phenotypic and functional characteristics of T cells and their interactions with MC, we isolated PE cells from 15 children. At the immunophenotypic analysis, high percentages of activated T cells were identified (mean value: 15% double staining for CD3\/DR; 12% CD25+). T cells with gamma\/delta T cell receptor (mean 5%) and natural killer cells (mean 17%) were also present in elevated numbers. MC lines (n = 7) and interleukin-2-dependent T cell lines (9 CD4+; 1 CD8+) were also obtained by incubating PE cells under different conditions. Two cell lines showed a major histocompatibility complex (MHC) restricted cytotoxic activity against autologous MC; two lines killed allogeneic MC; one line killed both autologous and allogeneic MC. Although the hypothesis that activated T cells could kill MC after recognition of surface structures modified by dialysis fluid, or during antigen presentation, needs to be further investigated, our data suggest that the subsets of lymphocytes we identified could play an important role in the mechanisms of peritoneal membrane defense.","844":"Little is known about the factors contributing to the reduced antibody response to hepatitis B vaccination in peritoneal dialysis patients. The influence of nutritional status [as assessed by serum albumin and nitrogen protein appearance (nPNA)], residual renal function, and dialysis adequacy (weekly Kt\/V(urea)) on the development of hepatitis B antibodies was examined in 32 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis\/continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis patients. Vaccination with Engerix 40 micrograms given intramuscularly at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months resulted in a 63% response with 20 converters and 12 nonconverters. Patient age, sex, months on peritoneal dialysis, and race were not different among converters and nonconverters. Median serum albumin (3.75 vs 3.8 g\/dL), nPNA (0.96 vs 0.94 g\/kg\/day initial and 0.78 vs 0.84 g\/kg\/day final), residual renal function (5.4 vs 4.0 mL\/min), and final weekly Kt\/V (2.12 vs 1.96) were not different among converters and nonconverters, respectively. Initial Kt\/V was higher in converters (2.37 vs 2.01, p = 0.02). Nutritional status, residual renal function, and weekly Kt\/V in nutritionally replete and well-dialyzed peritoneal dialysis patients do not predict response to hepatitis B vaccine. Patients with higher weekly Kt\/V early in the course of peritoneal dialysis may be more likely to respond to hepatitis B vaccination.","845":"The use of amino acid dialysate (AAD) has been shown to improve the nutritional status of malnourished continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. We report on a randomized, prospective, cross-over study evaluating the effects of a single, daily, postprandial 2-L exchange of 1.1% AAD (Nutrineal) on a nutritionally unselected group of 18 stable CAPD patients. Patients in group A (n = 10) were randomized to receive AAD in the initial six months, whereas group B (n = 8) patients received AAD in the final six months of the study. Regular biochemical, hematological, and anthropometric measurements were made. A computerized nutrition score(1) combined anthropometry, serum albumin, and total lymphocyte count. Improved nutritional status was indicated by a decreased score. Mean serum albumin and transferrin did not show a significant rise in either group. However, patients in group A, with a mean serum albumin of less than 30 g\/L, showed a significant rise at two months, which persisted at six months (26.8 g\/L on entry, 29.0 g\/L at two months, 30.1 g\/L at six months; p &lt; 0.05 and p &lt; 0.01, respectively). Treatment with AAD showed a trend towards improvement in midarm muscle circumference in both groups (22.9 -23.5 cm, group A; 22.9-23.7 cm, group B). The nutrition score improved in both groups but was significant only in group A (14.6 to 13.1; p = 0.02). These effects of AAD on the nutritional status of CAPD patients need validation in a long-term study to evaluate the effects on morbidity and mortality.","846":"Malnutrition is a well-recognized risk factor for survival in chronic dialysis patients. Experimental evidence links acidosis to decreases in albumin synthesis and increased breakdown. We studied serum bicarbonate, albumin, and total protein concentrations in 79 peritoneal dialysis patients (mean age 53 +\/- 14 years) during a 21-month observation period. No changes were observed in blood urea nitrogen (66 +\/- 19 vs 61 +\/- 18 mg\/dL), serum creatinine (9.8 +\/- 4.5 vs 10.7 +\/- 4.5 mg\/dL), serum bicarbonate (25 +\/- 3 vs 25 +\/- 3 mEq\/L), anion gap (16 +\/- 3 vs 17 +\/- 3 mEq\/L), and serum albumin (3.6 +\/- 0.6 vs 3.6 +\/- 0.6 g\/dL) concentrations between the first and last trimester of follow-up. A poor correlation was also found between serum albumin concentration and anion gap (R = -0.373) and bicarbonate (R = -0.172) concentrations. Finally, when grouped by acid-base status, serum protein (6.5 +\/- 0.7 vs 6.5 +\/- 0.8 g\/dL) and albumin (4.0 +\/- 0.4 vs 3.9 +\/- 0.4 g\/dL), concentrations were similar in patients with serum bicarbonate levels &lt; or &gt; or = 22 mEq\/L, respectively. In conclusion, a mild to moderate degree of acidosis is not associated with decreases in serum albumin concentrations in stable chronic peritoneal dialysis patients.","847":"Malnutrition is often present on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and contributes to morbidity and mortality. Diabetics (DM) have an increased risk for developing malnutrition. Our purpose was to assess the nutritional status (NS) of our CAPD population, to define NS differences between DM and nondiabetics (NoDM), and to identify NS-related factors. Patients were subjected to a nutritional assessment, which included a 24-hour dietary recall and a nutritional scoring system including anthropometric, biochemical, and subjective evaluation, and that classifies patients as: normal, and mildly, moderately, and severely malnourished. We studied 90 patients: 35 DM and 55 NoDM. In our whole population we observed a high frequency of malnutrition: NS was normal in 18%, and 20% had mild, 24% had moderate, and 38% had severe malnutrition. Ninety-one percent of DM and 76% of NoDM showed some degree of malnutrition. DM patients had significantly higher levels of malnutrition (p = 0.02), were significantly older, had more body fat, and spent less time on dialysis. There were 37 males and 53 females. Sex distribution was similar between DM and NoDM. Seventy-six percent of males and 86% of females had malnutrition. Moderate and severe malnourishment were more frequent in females. DM and female sex were the strongest predictors for moderate and severe malnutrition.","848":"Several lines of evidence suggest that continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) may differ in glucose, amino acid, and protein mass transfer. Thus, depending on modality, variances in protein and caloric balance could affect nutritional parameters. We prospectively followed 58 patients on CAPD (n = 36) or CCPD (n = 22) for 21 months (age: 54 +\/- 14 years; weight: 76 +\/- 16 kg; body mass index: 25.8 +\/- 5.1 kg\/m2). Twenty-four-hour dialysate effluent (Kpt\/V) and normalized protein catabolic rate values were comparable in both CAPD and CCPD patients (0.23 +\/- 0.05 vs 0.20 +\/- 0.05 and 0.93 +\/- 0.23 vs 0.87 +\/- 0.21 g\/kg\/day, respectively). At the last trimester, CAPD patients had greater body weight and body mass index increases than those on CCPD (1.6 +\/- 1.1 vs 0.3 +\/- 1.1 kg and 0.53 +\/- 0.42 vs 0.06 +\/- 0.35 kg\/m2, respectively), which did not reach statistical significance. No differences were noted in serum protein, albumin, or cholesterol levels (6.5 +\/- 0.1 vs 6.5 +\/- 0.2 g\/dL; 3.5 +\/- 0.1 vs 3.7 +\/- 0.1 g\/dL; and 211 +\/- 10 vs 209 +\/- 10 mg\/dL for CAPD and CCPD, respectively). In summary, this study demonstrates that CAPD and CCPD, when delivered in equal amounts, result in similar weight gains and maintain comparable biochemical nutritional parameters.","849":"Our aim was an evaluation of daily protein and energy intake, plasma protein, albumin, and cholesterol concentrations as well as total iron binding capacity in the course of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for up to 36 months. Our results indicate that CAPD patients, despite adequate clinical laboratory scores for up to 36 months of treatment, usually do not show optimal protein intake. When protein calorie malnutrition is prolonged, plasma proteins decrease. On the other hand, the greater the peritoneal permeability the lower the plasma protein intake.","850":"To investigate the factors affecting low values of serum albumin (SA) in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, we undertook a cross-sectional study of 106 CAPD patients, with a mean age of 49.0 years and dialysis duration of 43.4 months, with respect to demographic, clinical, and biochemical parameters. In group I (n = 28, SA &lt; or = 3.5 g\/dL), diabetics were more common, patients were significantly older, and more patients were malnourished, according to the subjective global assessment (SGA), compared to group II (n = 78, SA &gt; 3.5 g\/dL). Serum C-reactive protein (CRP), lipoprotein (a), and 24-hour dialysate-to-plasma creatinine concentration ratio (D\/P) were significantly higher, and 24-hour dialysate albumin was greater in group I. Compared to group II, group I had significantly lower serum creatinine and urea nitrogen appearance (UNA). Blood urea nitrogen (BUN), lean body mass (LBM), % of body weight (%BW), and normalized protein equivalent of nitrogen appearance (nPNA) tended to be lower in the low SA group, without statistical significance. There were no differences in the duration of CAPD, peritonitis rate, serum insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), anthropometric data, dietary assessment, dialysis adequacy, and residual renal function (RRF) between the two groups. SA was positively correlated with serum creatinine, IGF-I, LBM, UNA, BUN, nPNA, and CAPD duration, and was negatively correlated with 24-hour D\/P, 24-hour dialysate albumin, age, CRP, and bicarbonate (HCO3-). By stepwise multiple logistic regression analysis, 24-hour D\/P, age, CRP, and SGA were independent risk factors for low SA level. In conclusion, SA seems to be influenced not only by nutritional factors but also by nonnutritional factors such as peritoneal membrane transport characteristics, age, and presence of acute phase protein response manifested by CRP elevation.","851":"Protein intakes of patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) are estimated by protein catabolic rate (PCR) or dietary protein intake assessments (DPI). In this study we compared two approaches suggested by Randerson et al. for calculating PCR. One method incorporates urea generation rate (UG) and estimated dialysate protein losses (PCR), while the other includes UG and measured dialysate protein losses (PCR). We feel that calculating PCR2 is more convenient in practice. We studied 95 patients on CAPD, 49 men and 46 women, with a mean age of 56.5 years (range 26.6-84.5 years) and lean body mass of 41 kg (range 19-71 kg). Mean +\/- SEM of PCR1, PCR2, and DPI were: 0.89 +\/- 0.02, 0.86 +\/- 0.02, and 0.90 +\/- 0.04 g\/kg standard weight (std wt)\/day, respectively. PCR1 and PCR2 were highly and significantly correlated (r = 0.94, p = 0.0001). The difference of PCR1-PCR2 is plotted against dialysate protein loss, which reveals that PCR2 often underestimates PCR1 if dialysate protein loss is &gt; 10 g\/day, but this difference is minimum (&lt; 0.1 g\/kg standard weight\/day) when the dialysate protein loss is &lt; 15 g\/day. We conclude that PCR2 is an easy and effective method to monitor nutritional status in the majority of CAPD patients as very few will have dialysate protein losses &gt; 15 g\/day.","852":"In diabetic patients treated with dialysis, morbidity and mortality are more elevated than in nondiabetic patients. For the high dropout of diabetic patients between the first and the second year of treatment not much data are available on their nutritional parameters. For this reason, after excluding patients who had not had a two-years follow-up, we compared two groups of patients, 8 diabetics and 10 nondiabetics, similar in age (66.0 +\/- 8.1 vs 65.0 +\/- 8.3 years) and weight (61.8 +\/- 11.9 vs 62.1 +\/- 5.5 kg), measuring their nutritional parameters [body mass index (BMI), normalized protein catabolic rate (PCRN), albumin, transferrin, cholesterol], dialytic dose (Kt\/V), renal residual function (RRF) and peritoneal urea (Kdu) and creatinine clearances (Kdcr) after one and 24 months of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). At the start of CAPD, diabetics had greater weekly Kt\/V (2.77 +\/- 0.68 vs 2.19 +\/- 0.35, p &lt; 0.03) for a better residual renal function (5.0 +\/- 2.0 vs 2.6 +\/- 1.6 mL\/min, p &lt; 0.01) and greater loss of proteins in dialysate (7.8 +\/- 2.3 vs 5.2 +\/- 2.1 g\/day, p &lt; 0.05). After 24 months diabetic patients showed a significant decrease in albumin (3.44 +\/- 0.34 vs 2.92 +\/- 0.33 g\/dL, p &gt; 0.01), PCRN (1.21 +\/- 0.20 vs 0.92 +\/- 0.10 g\/kg\/day, p &lt; 0.02), and weekly Kt\/V (2.77 +\/- 0.68 vs 2.25 +\/- 0.38, p &lt; 0.05), and a reduction, even if not as significant as with nondiabetic patients, in residual renal function (5.0 +\/- 2.0 vs 3.0 +\/- 2.3, p = NS). BMI (p &lt; 0.01) was significantly increased in both groups, and this increase is higher in diabetic patients, while transferrin and cholesterol had no significant variations in both groups of patients. Peritoneal clearances did not change in 24 months, whereas the daily protein loss into dialysate was constantly higher in diabetic patients. In conclusion, diabetic patients have, over time, a decrease of total (renal and peritoneal) clearances of urea and creatinine (primarily because of loss of residual renal function, a reduced protein intake (evaluated as PCRN), and an increased loss of proteins from the peritoneum, which bring about a decrease in albuminemia, a possible concomitant cause of the greater morbidity and mortality in diabetic patients.","853":"Protein malnutrition occurs in 41%-42% of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, indicating that the current intake of protein is inadequate in many patients. With an intake of protein &gt; or = 1 g\/kg\/day, most continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients are in positive or neutral nitrogen balance, while with an intake below this there is considerable risk of negative nitrogen balance. Most CAPD patients are prescribed a diet containing 1.2 g\/kg\/ day protein or higher, yet the majority of patients have an intake lower than this. Several factors are associated with inadequate protein intake including older age, comorbidity, and loss of residual renal function when the dialysis regimen is inadequate. A minimum weekly Kt\/V of 2.0 is needed to achieve a protein intake of 0.9-1.0 g\/kg\/day. Patients with peritonitis and a permeable membrane have increased losses of protein via the dialysate, and so are at risk for protein malnutrition. To prevent and treat protein malnutrition, routine assessment of both nutritional status and dialysis adequacy are needed. Patients with an adequate clearance (weekly Kt\/V of 2.0 or higher, creatinine clearance of 60 L\/week\/1.73 m2), who are eating 1 g\/kg\/day and have no markers of malnutrition, including a normal serum albumin, require no intervention. Protein supplements can be prescribed to increase the protein ingestion to 1.2 g\/kg\/day or more, if the serum albumin is low, or if the patient is clinically malnourished with weight loss and decreased muscle mass. Gastro-paresis and esophagitis, common in PD patients, can be treated. If supplements, dietary counseling, and adequate dialysis regimen do not result in improvement of nutritional status, amino acid dialysate may be beneficial. One to two exchanges per day using amino acid dialysate converts the nitrogen balance from neutral to positive in malnourished CAPD patients. To use amino acid dialysate successfully, the physician must be sure that the clearance is adequate as the serum urea nitrogen rises; inadequate dialysis can result in uremia and decreased intake.","854":"Cardiovascular disease (CVD) is the single most important cause of mortality in hemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. An increased lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] level in HD patients is associated with CVD. However, Lp(a) levels in CAPD patients are controversial, and their association with CVD has not been established. In the present study, prevalent CAPD and HD patients [excluding those who were human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive] attending the Long Island College Hospital from June, 1990 to July, 1995 underwent analysis of lipid profile including Lp(a). Total and low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, triglycerides, apolipoprotein (apo) A, and apo B were all significantly increased in CAPD patients compared to HD patients. Serum Lp(a) levels were also significantly higher in CAPD patients than in HD patients (51 +\/- 32 vs 34 +\/- 23 mg\/dL, p &lt; 0.001). CAPD patients who had a history of myocardial infarction (MI) or coronary artery disease (CAD) at enrollment had significantly higher Lp(a) levels compared to those who did not have a history of MI or CAD. CAPD patients who died of CVD had higher Lp(a) levels than patients who died of non-CVD causes. In the Cox model with backward stepwise selection, a history of CVD was associated with a significantly elevated relative risk (RR) of mortality (RR = 1.84, p = 0.014). Expected survival by all causes of mortality and by cardiac mortality was significantly shorter in patients with a history of CVD than in those without a history of CVD. Thus, elevated Lp(a) is related to increased CVD and therefore may contribute to increased mortality in CAPD patients.","855":"We compared the lipid-lowering effects of simvastatin, a 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl coenzyme A reductase inhibitor, and gemfibrozil, a fibric acid derivative, in 22 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients whose serum total cholesterol and\/or triglyceride levels were &gt; or = 220 mg\/dL after a standard diet for six months. The study group was first treated with gemfibrozil (600 mg\/b.i.d.) for three months (stage 1). After a wash-out period of two months, during which no treatment was given, all of the patients became hyperlipidemic again and, therefore, were given simvastatin (10 mg\/day) for three months (stage 2), which was followed by another two-month wash-out period. A control group, which served to evaluate the natural progression of pharmacologically untreated dyslipidemia, was followed during the same period. Blood determinations of triglyceride, total cholesterol, and high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol were performed after each step. Low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol and HDL ratio were calculated from the measured values. Both gemfibrozil and simvastatin improved all parameters of the lipid profile, but the effect of simvastatin was better than that of gemfibrozil (-69 vs -39 mg\/dL for triglyceride and -95 vs -64 mg\/dL for cholesterol), while their actions on LDL and HDL cholesterol were of equal magnitude. Two months after discontinuation of simvastatin, significant decreases of total cholesterol (-46 mg\/dL) and triglyceride (-60 mg\/dL) were still present, while these values had returned to pretreatment levels after stopping gemfibrozil. The HDL ratio remained markedlyhigher (p &lt; 0.05) during the wash-out period after simvastatin, while it decreased to pretreatment values after gemfibrozil was stopped. The lipid profile of the control group did not change during the follow-up. Both drugs were well tolerated, and no serious side effects occurred.","856":null,"857":"Recently, several reports have suggested that there is a higher incidence of low turnover bone in the absence of aluminium exposure in peritoneal dialysis patients than in hemodialysis patients. Relative hypoparathyroidism with mild hypercalcemia, induced by a positive calcium balance, is considered to be one of the major causes of this disorder. Thus, we recruited 9 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients with relative hypoparathyroidism and low bone turnover [intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) &lt; 50 pg\/mL, intact osteocalcin &lt; 10.0 ng\/mL] who had been prescribed 1.75 mmol\/L calcium (Ca) dialysate for 5.0 +\/- 0.3 years. They were then treated by low Ca (1.25 mmol\/L) dialysate for nine months without vitamin D and aluminum administration. Intact PTH and bone metabolic markers [intact osteocalcin, alkaline phosphatase (ALP)] were measured every three months. Intact PTH levels increased from 21.1 +\/- 3.8 to 159.2 +\/- 32.8 pg\/mL after the first three months; thereafter, those levels were maintained at around 150 pg\/mL. On the other hand, intact osteocalcin levels rose consecutively from 6.7 +\/- 1.2 to reach 22.0 +\/- 3.8 ng\/mL after nine months. Interestingly, the pattern of time course changes between PTH and intact osteocalcin was different. ALP activity did not change during the nine-month period. Corrected serum calcium was significantly decreased (p &lt; 0.001) to approximately 0.25 mmol\/L within one month, and the level remained almost the same thereafter. The serum phosphate level did not change without adjusting the original dose of calcium carbonate as a phosphate binder. We concluded that low Ca dialysate (1.25 mmol\/L) is effective for the treatment of CAPD-related hypoparathyroidism with low bone turnover.","858":"In this study bone mineralization was evaluated using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (DEXA), which measured regional bone mineral density [BMD (g\/cm2)] at two skeletal sites, the lumbar spine and the femur, in 33 patients (15 male, 18 female) undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) with no history of chronic disease or medications affecting bone. The biochemical profile included measurements of plasma levels of calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). We did not find any statistically significant difference or correlation between BMD and the examined parameters, except for the lower BMD values in the female population. Because of the reported findings of significantly lower PTH levels in CAPD patients with low turnover bone disease (adynamic bone disease) and the higher prevalence in CAPD than in hemodialysis patients, we tried to evaluate any correlation between BMD and iPTH levels in CAPD patients that were separated into two groups: group A (iPTH &lt; 200 pg\/mL), 13 patients, and group B (iPTH &gt; 200 pg\/mL), 20 patients. Data analysis revealed a negative correlation between PTH levels and BMD values (r = -0.66, p = 0.014) as PTH and serum calcium (r = -0.77, p = 0.002) only in group A. No other statistically significant changes were observed. These findings suggest that there is a favorable influence of CAPD modality on bone mineralization, while no special DEXA findings are representative of the possible appearance of adynamic bone disease.","859":"A high incidence of low turnover bone disease (LTBD) has been reported in predialysis and dialysis uremic patients, despite parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels two- to four-fold the upper normal limit. The aim of this study was to evaluate the trend of PTH in uremic patients after admission to continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or hemodialysis (HD). Thus, we evaluated 53 patients (27 CAPD and 26 HD) of 73 consecutive uremic patients starting CAPD or HD from 1992, who had at least one year follow-up on dialysis. HD and CAPD patients were comparable for age, nephropathy, and duration of uremia. All the patients had been treated with calcium carbonate (CaCO3) as the sole phosphate binder during the predialysis period. At the time of admission to dialysis PTH was &gt; 260 pg\/mL (fourfold above the upper normal limit) in 12 CAPD and 9 HD patients, between 130 and 260 pg\/mL in 6 CAPD and 5 HD patients, and &lt; 130 pg\/mL in 9 CAPD and 12 HD patients. Bone biopsy, performed in 22 patients, showed LTBD in 10 of 12 patients with PTH &lt; 130 pg\/mL and high bone turnover in 8 patients with PTH &gt; 260 pg\/mL. Patients were treated with a dialysate calcium (Ca) of 1.75 mmol\/L and were given CaCO3 to maintain serum phosphate &lt; 5 mg\/dL. Oral calcitriol was given if they developed hypocalcemia (&lt; 9 mg\/dL). Hypercalcemia (&gt; 10.5 mg\/dL) occurred in 13 CAPD and 17 HD patients, and was managed by discontinuation of calcitriol and reduction of dialysate Ca to 1.25-1.5 mmol\/L. A significant decrease in PTH and alkaline phosphatase was observed in both groups after six and 12 months of treatment. After one year of CAPD, PTH was &gt; 260 pg\/mL in 3 patients, between 130 and 260 pg\/mL in 4 (all on calcitriol), and &lt; 130 pg\/mL in 20 patients (17 on calcitriol, but only 2 mild hypercalcemic). After one year of HD, PTH was &gt; 260 pg\/mL in 3 patients, 130-260 pg\/mL in 5 (all on calcitriol), and &lt; 130 pg\/mL in 18 (11 on calcitriol, 1 mild hypercalcemic). (1) about 40% of predialysis patients treated with CaCO3 showed PTH levels suggestive of LTBD; (2) the proportion of patients with low PTH increases after one year on CAPD or HD, even though calcemia was maintained within the normal range; (3) suppressed PTH levels are associated with calcitriol therapy rather than dialysis modality; and (4) secondary hyperparathyroidism improves in most patients after one year on CAPD or HD. ","860":"Management of refractory ascites (RA) can be accomplished in many ways. Rapid recurrence will be a problem even with repeated paracentesis. We studied the use of a permanent Tenckhoff catheter (PTC) for drainage of RA in 10 patients. The cause of RA was cardiomyopathy in 7 patients, malignancy with liver metastasis in 2, and end-stage liver disease in 1 patient. The volume of ascites drained (AD) ranged from 0.5-7.0 L, with a mean of 2.6 L. Mean blood pressure pre-AD was 112\/68 mm Hg, and post-AD was 109\/66 mm Hg (p &gt; 0.05). Heart rate pre- and post-AD was 80 bpm and 81 bpm, respectively (p &gt; 0.05). The number of ADs ranged from two to 63 (mean: 16). There was no fluid replacement during or post-AD. There were no complications or infections from AD. The mean interval between ADs was 7.8 days. Mean duration of survival was six months. All patients eventually expired. In conclusion, PTC can be a useful and safe alternative for draining RA at home in terminally ill patients. Complications of repeated paracentesis are minimized, and the need for hospitalization is avoided. AD with PTC may be preferred to repeated paracentesis in RA.","861":"We prospectively monitored the clinical outcome of 89 curled, double-cuff peritoneal catheters (PC) implanted by surgeons over one year. Thirty-six cases (40%) were supported with hemodialysis (HD) (group A) and 53 cases (60%) were supported with weekly intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD) (small exchange volume with a cycler) (group B) for four weeks before commencing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). PC-related complications between the two groups were compared. Ten cases failed to complete the six-month observation period (8 died, 1 received kidney transplant, and 1 defaulted follow-up),Total experience accumulated was 494 patient-months (195 patient-months in group A, 299 patient-months in group B). The incidence of pericatheter leakage (group A vs group B) was significantly higher in group B (0% vs 13%, p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in the incidence of other PC-related complications, removal of PC, and mortality rate in the two groups. The incidence of pericatheter leakage was significantly higher in diabetic patients (71% vs 22%, p &lt; 0.05), and group B patients with leakage had a higher incidence of external cuff erosion 57% vs 7%, p &lt; 0.005) and delay in CAPD training (71% vs 7%, p &lt; 0.005). We conclude that both HD and IPD are equally safe renal replacement therapies in the break-in period, while patients supported with IPD had a higher incidence of pericatheter leakage, which was associated with other catheter-related morbidities including external cuff erosion and delay in CAPD training.","862":"Catheter obstruction by a fibrin clot is one of the early complications after catheter implantation in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. manual compression of the dialysis solution container is usually the initial method used in an attempt to dislodge clots formed in the catheter. However, it is usually difficult to achieve and maintain sufficient pressure to open the obstructed catheter by this method. Alternatively, forceful irrigation using a syringe with heparin or urokinase, or clot removal using a corkscrew clot remover can be tried. These conventional maneuvers may potentiate the chances for bacterial contamination. In addition, these procedures require hospital visits by the patient. To solve this problem, we developed a new infusion accelerator for CAPD. Recanalization was attempted using the infusion accelerator in six cases of complete catheter obstruction. The bag was pressurized to 450 mm Hg. In all six cases, catheter patency was completely recovered without any complications. After appropriate training of patients, this method may be performed by patients themselves. Given the ease and efficiency of this procedure utilizing the improved equipment, we think that in cases with complete catheter obstruction this method should be considered before initiating more invasive procedures.","863":"The proper function of peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheters can be compromised by catheter malposition, fibrin clot, or omental wrapping. The purpose of this study was to determine the efficacy of laparoscopy in the treatment of malfunctioning PD catheters. All patients undergoing laparoscopy for catheter dysfunction at MetroHealth Medical Center in Cleveland, Ohio, from 1991 to 1995, were reviewed. Twenty-six laparoscopies were performed in 22 patients, for malfunction occurring an average of 3.9 months following insertion (range 0.5-18 months). Omental and\/or small below wrapping as present in all but three cases. Lysis of adhesions was required in 19 of 26 cases, with repositioning only in seven. Eight patients had failed attempts at stiff wire manipulation prior to laparoscopy. Perioperative complications occurred in seven cases, consisting of temporary dialysate leakage (2), enterotomy (1), and early reocclusion (4). Repeat laparoscopy was successful in three of these four reocclusions. The overall success rate (catheter function &gt; 30 days after laparoscopy) was 21\/22 (96%). Laparoscopy is highly accurate and effective in the management of peritoneal dialysis catheter dysfunction and results in prolongation of catheter life.","864":"Rates of peritoneal dialysis-associated catheter infections and peritonitis were compared in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients grouped on the basis of their response to hepatitis B vaccination with Engerix to assess the usefulness of vaccination in predicting patients at risk for peritonitis and catheter infections. Engerix was given intramuscularly in a dose of 40 micrograms at 0, 1, 2, and 6 months. Sixty-three percent (20\/32) of patients developed hepatitis B surface antibodies (converters). Converters and nonconverters were not different in proportions of women, whites, diabetics, or Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriers; mean age and mean months on peritoneal dialysis were also not different. Overall, peritonitis (0.46\/year vs 0.33\/year) and catheter infection (0.53\/year vs 0.54\/year) rates were not different among converters and nonconverters, respectively. Nonconverters had higher S. aureus peritonitis rates (0.12\/year vs 0.04\/year, p &lt; 0.05) but lower S. epidermidis peritonitis rates (0.03\/year vs 0.18\/year, p &lt; 0.02). However, when the patient with recurrent S. epidermidis peritonitis was excluded from analysis, S. epidermidis peritonitis rates among converters and nonconverters were not different (0.13\/year vs 0.03\/year, respectively, p &lt; 0.09). These data suggest that the development of surface antibodies with hepatitis B vaccination does not predict a reduced risk of S. epidermidis peritonitis. The possibility that nonconverters are more likely to be S. aureus nasal carriers and therefore at greater risk of S. aureus peritonitis deserves further study.","865":"In this study, we performed exit-site care using one of three methods (A: cleanse the exit site with povidone-iodine daily and apply gauze dressing; B: cleanse the exit site with povidone-iodine once a week, cover the site with a small gauze, and seal it completely with dressing film; C: the same as in B, above, except once every two weeks). The results show that there was a higher rate of positive bacterial growth in method A (17\/24, 71%), and we concluded that the sterility of the exit site was not maintained 24 hours after cleansing. In methods B and C, in which the exit site was kept sealed, we did not detect bacterial growth in almost any of the cases (B = 0\/44, C = 1\/7). Although the patients took a bath and did not perform any care of the exit site for one to two weeks, the results show that the exit site was protected from bacterial invasion. We believe that this method could reduce exit-site infection while requiring no daily care.","866":"Our objective was to evaluate the multiple use of the tubing set of the HomeChoice automated peritoneal dialysis (PD) system in PD patients. The study was designed to reuse the tubing set of the HomeChoice automated PD system for two to seven treatments, each of 16-24 hours duration, in end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients, and to continue to use the same set if the patient was disconnected for any reason. In a tertiary-referral university hospital, 17 ESRD patients on PD, admitted to a university hospital from January, 1995 to September, 1995, were studied. The patients were disconnected and connected in between or during PD treatments. Five-liter bags were used. All the fluid was either set initially or added as clinically indicated. One hundred and thirty-eight PD treatments were performed with the HomeChoice automated PD system, using 30 disposable (tubing) sets. Sixty-three disconnections were made for ambulation, transfer to other units, surgery, physical therapy, radiological investigations, and special procedures in between and during PD treatments. No episode of peritonitis occurred. The multiple use resulted in a 78% reduction in tubing sets and drain-line extension sets used, thereby reducing the disposable supplies and creating a substantial saving in nursing time. The multiple use of tubing sets of the HomeChoice automated PD system was safe and economical in patients undergoing automated PD in a hospital setting.","867":"Persistent exit-site infections and tunnel infections (ESI\/TI) are a cause for removal of Swan neck catheters (SNC). Previous studies report variable success in the treatment of these infections by surgical exposure and removal of the subcutaneous external cuff. We report our experience with this technique. All 5 patients with persistent ESI\/TI were successfully treated with antibiotics and surgical intervention. All cultures grew Staphylococcus aureus. Average time to complete healing after surgical exposure was 39.4 days. Mean follow-up after complete healing was 164.8 days. There were no subsequent episodes of ESI\/TI in these patients. None of the catheters subsequently malfunctioned or developed leaks. Persistent ESI\/TI in Swan neck catheters can be successfully treated with surgical exposure and removal of the subcutaneous external cuff.","868":"A previous study showed that silver-coating peritoneal catheters tended to decrease the incidence of early exit-site infections in rats. This study was designed to further evaluate the healing, biocompatability, and external tunnel morphology of standard and silver-coated catheters. Catheters were coated with silver by an ion beam-assisted process. Fourteen male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent implantation of either a standard or silver-coated double-cuff peritoneal catheter. Weekly observation and photographs documented exit-site characteristics. Erythema, exudate, loose fit, and poor hair growth were evidence of an inflamed exit. Overt infection was indicated by the presence of three or more of the following: erythema, purulent exudate, exuberant granulation tissue, loose fit, and poor hair growth. Animals were sacrificed at six weeks, and catheters were removed and processed for histology of the external tunnel. Multiple measurements were taken using a Filar eyepiece, and data were expressed as a mean of several readings. Inflammation, vascularity, and fibrosis were judged semiquantitatively. At the end of six weeks, six of the seven exits of the silver catheters showed excellent healing, while one exit site had signs of excessive inflammation. Four of the exit sites of the standard catheters healed well, two were inflamed, and one was overtly infected. The sinus tract of the standard and silver catheters had similar characteristics: keratinized and nonkeratinized epithelium lined the external part of the sinus tract and merged into granulation tissue. A fibrous sheath was noted in some sinus tracts between the granulation tissue and the cuff. The cuff evoked a foreign body reaction, with fibrosis, multiple giant cells, and vascularization. Poorly healing or infected sinus tracts had highly vascular granulation tissue with overlying exudate. The cuff of these catheters had marked inflammation and scanty giant cells, although collagen bundle thickness was similar to the well-healing catheters. In conclusion, silver-coating potentially enhances healing of the exit sites of peritoneal catheters. Additionally, the similarity of the tunnel histomorphology of standard and silver catheters confirms the favorable biocompatibility of silver.","869":"The endotoxin (ET) in cloudy peritoneal fluid was measured, and the usefulness of the method was examined. Thirteen continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients with an episode of peritonitis from December, 1993 to December, 1995 were studied. The peritoneal fluid was collected without contamination from the bags and divided into two batches. The ET was measured in one of them with the limulus amebocyte lysate (LAL) assay, and the other was cultured for bacteria. Among the 13 patients ET was positive in 7 Gram-negative bacteria were identified in all 7 cases. Two of these patients were transferred to hemodialysis. On the other hand, gram-positive bacteria were cultured in only four episodes of the 6 ET-negative patients, all of which were treated successfully with vancomycin. Microbiological culture of the dialysate is still necessary for the treatment of peritonitis. But it takes 24-48 hours to obtain microbiological results. The result of the ET test can be given within one and one half hours (and it has 100% sensitivity and specificity for gram-negative peritonitis) at presentation in the episodes. Therefore, the ET test of the dialysate is very effective for the therapy of peritonitis in CAPD.","870":"It has been suggested that psychosocial (PS) factors may influence morbidity and mortality in chronically ill patients. However, investigators have not examined how PS factors affect specific medical problems in chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) patients. Sixty-eight patients maintained on CPD therapy were studied. PS testing included a self-rating form of patient-assessed quality of life (PaQOL), depression [Beck's Depression Inventory (BDI)], anxiety [Patient Rated Anxiety Scale (PRAS)], and assessment of physical symptoms (KDS-II). Peritonitis rates six months prior to PS assessment and six months after assessment were tabulated. The data show that during the study period patients with more than one episode of peritonitis compared to those with no episodes of peritonitis had: (1) significantly higher anxiety and physical symptom scores; (2) significantly lower PaQOL; and (3) higher depression scores, which did not reach statistical significance (p &lt; 0.06). Whether higher peritonitis rates result in worse PS symptoms, or whether poor PS symptoms cause higher peritonitis rates needs to be determined with further investigations.","871":"Our objective was to study endogenous peritonitis and related catheter outcome in peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. The study was designed to investigate endogenous peritonitis and related catheter loss in all end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who started peritoneal dialysis from January, 1989 to September, 1995. In a tertiary-referral university hospital, 192 ESRD patients (117 male, 75 female) who entered the home program from 1\/89 to 9\/95 were studied. Sixteen episodes of endogenous peritonitis occurred in 15 PD patients (7 male, 8 female) with a mean age of 63 years (range 33-81 years). Five patients were diabetic. Two hundred and seventeen episodes of peritonitis in 192 patients occurred over 4149 patient-months, resulting in one episode\/19.1 patient-months. Sixteen episodes of endogenous peritonitis were encountered in 15 patients, accounting for 7% of all episodes of peritonitis. The mean duration of PD before contracting endogenous peritonitis was 24.2 months (range 7-52 months). Eleven episodes were related to diverticular leak\/perforation, three to sigmoidoscopy\/colonoscopy\/PEG procedures, one to unknown etiology, and one to cholecystitis. During 11 episodes, severe constipation preceded. All the patients were initially treated conservatively with antibiotics. Five episodes (31%) responded to antibiotic therapy alongside antifungal prophylaxis and continued PD. One episode (6%) required cholecystectomy without catheter removal and resumed PD. Six episodes (38%) required catheter removal due to subsequent fungal peritonitis in a mean of 11 days (range 3-24 days): 4 patients transferred to hemodialysis and 2 patients resumed PD. Three patients underwent catheter removal along with colectomy and colostomy: 2 patients transferred to hemodialysis and 1 patient died in ten days. One patient refused surgery and died in 16 days. Endogenous peritonitis resulted in a high incidence of catheter loss and dropout from PD. Peritonitis due to bowel leak without frank bowel perforation can be managed with antibiotic therapy and antifungal prophylaxis. Aggressive management of constipation may decrease endogenous peritonitis.","872":"Our objective was to evaluate antifungal prophylaxis for secondary fungal peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients. The study was designed to investigate antifungal prophylaxis for fungal peritonitis and to compare the incidence of fungal peritonitis without (January, 1991-July, 1993) and with (August, 1993-December, 1995) antifungal prophylaxis. In a tertiary-referral university hospital, 122 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients (77 male, 45 female) during period A (1\/91-7\/93) were observed for 1832 patient-months with no antifungal prophylaxis. One hundred and twelve ESRD patients (71 male, 41 female) during period B (8\/93-12\/95) were observed over 1705 patient-months with antifungal prophylaxis with fluconazole. Fluconazole 200 mg was given orally (po) as first dose at the onset of antibiotic therapy, then 100 mg po every other day, and was continued for one week after the antibiotic therapy. Forty-nine patients (28 male, 21 female; mean age 48.8 years) developed 105 episodes of peritonitis during period A. Forty-eight patients (36 male, 12 female; mean age 53.8 years) developed 95 episodes of peritonitis during period B. Fifteen episodes of fungal peritonitis occurred over 1832 patient-months during period A. while four episodes of fungal peritonitis were observed over 1705 patient-months during period B. Twelve episodes of secondary fungal peritonitis occurred during period A, while only two episodes occurred during period B. This incidence of secondary fungal peritonitis was significantly reduced with antifungal prophylaxis (p &lt; 0.02). No side effect of fluconazole was observed. In conclusion, secondary fungal peritonitis was significantly decreased following fluconazole antifungal prophylaxis at our center.","873":"We present the results of a protocol of empiric monotherapy of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)-related peritonitis with ciprofloxacin (CPX), with a special emphasis on the evolution of our results after seven years of continued use of this drug. One hundred and fifteen episodes of bacterial peritonitis were treated with CPX between 1988 and 1992 (group A), and 115 episodes were treated between 1993 and 1995 (group B). The etiologic spectrum of peritonitis was similar in both groups, except for a higher incidence of polymicrobial infections in group B. The clinical success rate decreased from 86.5% in group A to 75% in group B (p &lt; 0.05). This was partly due to the high failure rate of CPX against polymicrobial peritonitis, but the success rate also tended to decrease for gram-positive and, especially, gram-negative bacteria. However, in vitro sensitivity to CPX decreased only for coagulase-negative staphylococci, remaining stable for Staphylococcus aureus and gram-negative bacteria. CPX is still a valid alternative for the treatment of CAPD-related peritonitis in our unit. However, bacterial sensitivity must be closely monitored, especially in the case of coagulase-negative staphylococci. A different therapeutic approach may be indicated if polymicrobial peritonitis is suspected.","874":"Peritonitis is known to acutely affect the transport characteristics of the peritoneal membrane, however, the long-term effects are not known. We studied the effect of peritoneal inflammation on mean dialysate-to-plasma creatinine concentration ratio (D\/P), dialysate protein losses (DPL, g\/week), and dialysate albumin losses (DAL, g\/week), done at six weeks or more postepisode, in 152 patients [102 (67%) males, mean age 57 years (range 21-91)]. These patients were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis for a mean of twelve months (range 1-97). A total of 94 distinct peritonitis episodes were managed in 47 patients (31%). The number of patients with 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 episodes of peritonitis were 105, 29, 3, 6, 4, and 5. These episodes were treated with a standard protocol. There were no statistically significant differences between the D\/P, DPL, or DAL between the groups. The parameters did not show any correlation to time on dialysis. Thus, in conclusion, peritonitis, if promptly treated, does not cause any permanent change in D\/P, DAL, or DPL.","875":"Transferring adolescent patients from pediatric to adult renal units can be difficult for all concerned. There has been little agreement or discussion on the factors involved in the timing of the transition. Communication and choice are key words when dealing with young people. The process of transition can be improved by discussion between the patient and team members on the likely timing of transition and the choice of an adult unit offering the same treatment modalities, for example, automated peritoneal dialysis. Information about the adult unit should be obtained, and liaison visits by patient, family members, and possibly accompanying staff are considered helpful. Transition should be a positive event, and each adolescent will require an individualized plan devised in discussion with team members.","876":"The limitations and usefulness of glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1) as a means of assessing glycemic control in peritoneal dialysis (PD) and the importance of good glycemic control in diabetics on PD were analyzed. HbA1 levels may be elevated in renal failure because of either interference with the assay of HbA1 by carbamylated hemoglobin, which is formed by dissociation of urea to cyanate and condensation of cyanate with hemoglobin, or increased rate of formation of HbA1 secondary to acidosis or other uremic effects. Interference with the assay of HbA1 is limited to methods separating HbA1 from hemoglobin A by electrical charges and is not encountered when chemical or immunologic assays are used. The proposed effect of uremia on the rate of formation of HbA1 was refuted by in vitro studies and in vivo multifactorial analysis, which showed that blood glucose level is the only important determinant of HbA1 in patients with renal failure. HbA1 levels may be low in uremia because of shortened red cell survival and\/or frequent transfusions of red cells, conditions rarely encountered in PD patients. In the great majority of the reported studies, HbA1 regardless of the method of assay used, correlated with direct glycemic indices in patients with renal failure treated conservatively, by hemodialysis or by PD. Poor glycemic control, indicated by high HbA1 levels, is associated with adverse outcomes, including prolonged hospitalization and shortened survival, in diabetics on PD. HbA1 is a useful tool in assessing blood glucose control in PD. Good glycemic control is important for diabetics on PD.","877":"We performed a cross-sectional study to establish the hepatitis C virus (HCV) serologic status for all French patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) on January 1, 1995. We listed a total of 1508 patients, and the exhaustiveness rate was about of 75% of the whole French PD population treated at this date. Only 47 of the 1508 patients were anti-HCV positive (HCV+): the global HCV prevalence was 3.12%. HCV+ patients were treated by PD for a longer time than HCV-patients (4 +\/- 4 vs 2 +\/- 2 years; p &lt; 0.001); 89% of the HCV+ patients received blood transfusions; 60% had been previously treated by hemodialysis, and 26% previously received a kidney transplantation. In 49% of the HCV+ patients, HCV antibodies were discovered before the start of the peritoneal dialysis program, and a seroconversion was observed in only 4 (0.27%) of them during the PD treatment. All these patients received blood transfusion. In patients without past history of hemodialysis or transplantation (exclusively treated by PD), HCV prevalence was 1.5%, not far off that of the general population. Peritoneal dialysis seems not to be an additional risk factor for hepatitis C infection in France.","878":"The efficient use of recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) requires adequate body stores of iron. In peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, iron replacement is most commonly administered orally. In this study, we prospectively followed 7 stable PD patients following bolus intravenous infusion of 1 g iron dextran in an outpatient setting. At 12 weeks, significant (p &lt; 0.05) increments in mean hematocrit from 29.13% to 34.85%, transferrin saturation from 10.15% to 29.33%, serum iron from 27.38 to 67.00 micrograms\/dL, and serum ferritin from 150.30 to 331.40 ng\/mL were observed. Post-treatment, there was less requirement of rHuEPO, and at six months there was a 26% reduction in the mean weekly subcutaneous rHuEPO dose. At 12 weeks, serum albumin increased significantly from 3.50 to 3.76 g\/dL (p &lt; 0.05). There was no abnormality in any of the measured liver function tests. No patient developed an adverse or allergic reaction. We concluded that bolus intravenous infusion of iron dextran is an effective and well-tolerated method of repleting iron stores, and will allow a more efficient and economic use of rHuEPO in PD patients.","879":"Our objective was to investigate the clinical effect of a less toxic and less acidic peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluid produced in a two-compartment bag (PD-Bio). The study had an open cross-over design in 4 stable patients, where the patient served as his\/her own control. After a period of three months using conventional PD fluid the patients were switched to three months on the new PD fluid. Routine blood chemistry and transport characteristics were measured. Cell samples from overnight spent dialysis fluid were analyzed for viability, differential count, release of superoxide radicals, and cancer antigen 125 (CA 125). Subjective patient symptoms and handling properties were investigated by a patient questionnaire. Cancer antigen 125 increased significantly, and patients with discomfort or infusion pain during the control period improved during the PD-Bio period. Patient acceptance with respect to handling of the two-compartment bag was excellent and did not differ from the use of standard bags. No changes were seen in the cell samples from spent dialysate, blood chemistry, or transport characteristics between the two treatment periods. PH in the effluent dialysate was, however, significantly higher for PD-Bio at all times during the two-hour dwell. Our results suggest that a PD fluid produced to minimize the level of toxic glucose degradation products and to obtain a more physiological pH has an impact on CA 125 levels, reduces pain and discomfort in connection with infusion of fluid, and does not influence the transport characteristics.","880":"A survey in which there were responses from dialysis units caring for approximately 38% of women aged 14-44 receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis in the United States revealed a conception rate of 0.2% per year. A total of 44 pregnancies were identified in women treated with peritoneal dialysis at some time during their pregnancies. Two thirds of pregnancies were complicated by hypertension and one third by severe hypertension. There was little difficulty with catheter placement during pregnancy, and peritonitis was an unusual complication, which did not result in fetal loss. Forty-eight percent of pregnancies resulted in surviving infants. All but one were premature and two thirds were small for gestational age.","881":"To assess treatment adequacy by calculating total clearance (CL) in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD), fluids must be collected over 24 hours, a laborious procedure and prone to inaccuracy. CL calculation from the plasma disappearance curve of an injected tracer has none of the above inconveniences. We therefore compared creatinine clearance CR-CL with CL calculated from the plasma disappearance curve of 125I-iothalamate (IO) injected in a single intravenous bolus. Twelve patients aged 63 (44-80) years and on PD for four (1-44) months were studied in hospital. Nine plasma samples were taken for IO-CL after a bolus of 21 kBq\/kg of tracer. The least-squares biexponential fitting according to Gauss-Newton-Raphson was then carried out: [Aexp(-at) + Bexp(-bt)], and clearance was calculated by the formula, IO-CL = dose\/AUC, where AUC = A\/a + B\/b. Both CLs were normalized for 1.73 m2 of body surface. Agreement (r = 0.746, p = 0.005) for the CR-CL (6.8 +\/- 1.9 mL\/min) and IO-CL (7.6 +\/- 1.9 mL\/min) was good, with a difference of 0.9 +\/- 1.4 mL\/min (t = 2.182, p = 0.052). Extracellular volume (ECV), calculated from the IO plasma disappearance curve with the formula, ECV = dose\/ bAUC, and including the endoperitoneal fluid, was 19.8 +\/- 2.9 L (29.5 +\/- 6.2% body weight).","882":"Body composition determines body water content (the fraction body water\/body weight). With developing obesity, body weight and body water increase, but body water content decreases. The anthropometric formulas for urea volume (body water) for Kt\/V computations in nonamputated peritoneal dialysis subjects reflect this fundamental rule of body composition. However, the use of uncorrected anthropometric formulas in amputees provides body water content estimates inconsistent with the estimates of body composition obtained from nutritional assessment. Corrected estimates of urea volume can be obtained in three steps: (1) The non-amputated weight at the same body composition is computed by dividing the weight at the urea kinetic study (postamputation) by (1-the fractional weight loss from the amputation); (2) body water and body water content at this nonamputated weight are obtained from the appropriate anthropometric formula; (3) at the time of the urea kinetic study, post-amputation, body water is equal to the estimate of body water content obtained from step 2 times the body weight at the urea kinetic study. The corrected estimates of urea volume provide body water content values agreeing with the estimates from nutritional assessment.","883":"Our objective was to determine the adequacy of dialysis in our patients currently on home peritoneal dialysis and develop a program of surveillance aimed at maintaining tKt\/V (Kt\/V calculated from peritoneal clearance and residual renal function) greater than 2.0 as recommended by the CANUSA study. Eighty-nine patients were entered into our study between September, 1993 and September, 1995. Initial dialysate volumes used during the training period were determined by using a patient-specific protocol. Two weeks after discharge a standard peritoneal equilibration test was performed to determine total Kt\/V using a computer program, and dialysis prescriptions were changed to achieve a tKt\/V &gt; 2.0 in those patients who had tKt\/V &lt; 2.0, and those with tKt\/V &gt; 2.0 were followed without further intervention. Of the patients who had initial assessments, 33.7% had tKt\/V of 1.65 and 66.3% had tKt\/V of 2.46, and the difference was mainly due to residual renal function. Forty-four patients were started on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), of whom 34% had tKt\/V &lt; 2.0 and 66% had tKt\/V &gt; 2.0, and of the 36 patients on continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD), 30.5% had tKt\/V &lt; 2.0 and 69.5% had tKt\/V &gt; 2.0. The cost of changing dialysis prescriptions is less with CCPD than with CAPD, and a 0.8-1.0 L increase in dialysate volume will increase peritoneal Kt\/V (dKt\/V) by 0.1 on average. Patients weighing less than 53 kg can achieve a dKt\/V &gt; 2.0 even in the absence of residual renal function, but as body weight increases there is greater dependence on residual renal function to achieve adequate dialysis. We have been able to maintain patients on adequate dialysis (tKt\/V &gt; 2.0) by checking peritoneal clearance and residual renal function initially and on a regular basis. Whether a tKt\/V &gt; 2.0 will be sufficient to maintain health and well-being of our patients will require a longer period of observation.","884":"We evaluated the benefits of a multidisciplinary predialysis intervention to help home dialysis patients maintain employment. This program was shown to be successful with in-center hemodialysis patients in a case-controlled study published in the American Journal of Kidney Disease in September, 1993. We looked at 30 patients on home dialysis (28 on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and 2 on home hemodialysis) as of March, 1995. The age of the patients ranged from 28 to 63 years, with a mean of 46.8 years. Forty-three percent of the patients were diabetic. The patients went through a multidisciplinary predialysis program which consisted of: (1) psychosocial assessment, (2) education about dialysis and choice of modalities, (3) orientation to dialysis unit, and (4) counseling sessions with patient, significant family members, and others. During this time, patients were referred to the program approximately six months before beginning dialysis. There was continued collaboration among members of the multidisciplinary team. Of the 30 patients, 11 were already disabled when beginning dialysis. Of the 19 who were working once dialysis began, 14 maintained employment (3 diabetic), with 1 retiring and 4 becoming disabled. Therefore, 74% of patients maintained employment. In conclusion, employment was maintained by this predialysis multidisciplinary program.","885":"Clinical data and outcomes of 18 patients, aged 80 or older, on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) during the last five years were reviewed. There were 12 males and 6 females, with a mean age of 85 (range 82-91 years) and median duration on CAPD of 31.5 months (range 2-58 months). End-stage renal disease was caused by nephrosclerosis in 9, diabetes mellitus and light chain disease in 2 each, and chronic glomerulonephritis, membranous nephropathy, and IgA nephropathy in 1 each, with the cause unknown in yet another 2 patients. Hypertension and angina were the commonest comorbid conditions observed. Peritonitis episodes occurred one per 10.8 patient-months, and necessitated catheter removal in 7 patients and reinsertion in 6 of them. Fourteen episodes of exit-site infections were seen in 8 patients, 2 developed pericatheter leak, and 1 had tunnel infection. Nine patients are continuing CAPD successfully, with a median duration of 29 months (range 11-57 months). One patient was transferred to hemodialysis, and 8 died. The causes of death were peritonitis (3\/8), cerebrovascular accident (2\/8), pneumonia (1\/8), and septicemia (1\/8), with the cause not known in 1 patient. Our survival rate of 80% at three years is encouraging, and we advocate CAPD as a successful alternative treatment modality in octogenarians.","886":"To determine the impact of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) on cardiovascular risk factors in diabetic patients, we evaluated serum lipid profiles and plasma levels of coagulation and fibrinolysis parameters in 23 diabetic patients on long-term CAPD (aged 55 +\/- 14 years, mean +\/- SD), and compared them with those of diabetic patients undergoing hemodialysis (n = 62, 56 +\/- 10 years) or kidney transplantation (n = 14, 43 +\/- 14 years), and 40 normal subjects (39 +\/- 10 years). All of the parameters were compared using analysis of covariance to adjust for the difference in age among the four groups in males and females separately. In the male CAPD patients, there were no significant differences in the serum concentrations of lipids, lipoproteins, and apolipoproteins. In contrast, in the female CAPD patients, the levels of triglyceride and apolipoprotein (apo) B and the low-density lipoprotein (LDL) cholesterol\/ high-density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol ratio were significantly higher than those in the normal females. Lipoprotein (a) did not differ significantly among the four male and female groups. The plasma levels of fibrinogen and von Willebrand factor were higher both in the male and in the female CAPD patients than in the other corresponding groups. There was no significant difference in the levels of plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 among the four groups. In conclusion, CAPD is associated with a more atherogenic lipid profile than are hemodialysis and kidney transplantation in female diabetic patients, but not in male diabetic patients. Both male and female diabetic patients on CAPD have a hypercoagulability state but not a decreased fibrinolysis state.","887":"Cardiovascular disease is the most common cause of death among dialysis patients. Cardiovascular abnormalities that predispose to mortality include acute myocardial infarction, chronic ischemic heart disease, atherosclerotic peripheral vascular disease, congestive heart failure, left ventricular hypertrophy, dilated cardiomyopathy, hypertrophic hyperkinetic heart disease, prior cardiac arrest, and possibly systemic hypertension. This review explores the influences of cardiovascular disease on survival in patients with end-stage renal disease treated with dialysis.","888":"A high dropout rate is a major problem of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) treatment. Serum albumin is both a significant parameter of dropout in CAPD and a predictor of peritoneal transport category based on the peritoneal equilibration test (PET). High flux peritoneal membrane (HFPM) may lose more protein in the dialysate. We examined the effect of HFPM on the survival of treatment of CAPD. The study was composed of 171 adult patients who had standard PET. The peritoneal transport category was based on their first PET after starting CAPD. The HFPM was defined as the dialysate-to-plasma creatinine concentration ratio (D\/P) of more than one standard deviation of the mean (0.702 +\/- 0.114; D\/P &gt; 0.816). Twenty-two patients had HFPM. The other 149 patients were categorized as the non-high flux group. The high flux group had a significantly lower serum albumin at PET (3.07 +\/- 0.15 vs 3.68 +\/- 0.05 g\/dL, respectively p &lt; 0.0001) and lower mean serum albumin during treatment than the non-high flux group (3.40 +\/- 0.20 vs 3.70 +\/- 0.04 g\/dL, respectively, p = 0.020), and lower net drainage volume (p = 0.0007), but age, diabetes, total Kt\/V, and total normalized weekly creatinine clearance were not different between groups. The risk of dropout was higher in the high flux group (p = 0.0127, Cox-Mantel log rank test), and the risk increased, especially after 1.5 years of treatment. Corrected for other risk factors, patients who had HFPM have two times the risk of dropout compared to the non-high flux groups (p = 0.0401, Cox proportional hazards model).","889":"We have compared the incidence of delayed graft function (DGF) after renal transplantation in our patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) (group A, n = 92) or hemodialysis (HD) (group B, n = 587), analyzing the prevalence of the main risk factors for DGF in both groups. Both groups were comparable, except for a higher prevalence of diabetes (p &lt; 0.05) and a shorter time on dialysis (p &lt; 0.01) in group A. Immediate graft function occurred in 68.5% of group A and 46.5% of group B, DGF in 22.5% of group A and 39.5% of group B, and there was never any function in 9% of group A and 14% of group B (p &lt; 0.001). When potential risk factors for DGF were compared, no relevant differences could be found. HD was performed more frequently immediately before surgery in group B (p &lt; 0.001), but statistical analysis showed no impact of this measure on the incidence of DGF. In conclusion, in our population, patients on PD present higher rates of immediate graft function after renal transplantation than patients on HD. The explanation for the difference is not clear, but seems to be related to the dialysis modality itself, as the profile of risk factors for DGF is very similar in both populations.","890":"Differences have been reported in the decline of residual renal function in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and hemodialysis (HD), but it is unknown whether the urinary handling of water and solutes is similar in these patient groups. Ten CAPD patients with residual renal function were investigated during a clearance period (CP) of 24 hours, and 11 HD patients were investigated during one interdialytic interval of three days. In CAPD patients the urinary volume excretion was 0.65 +\/- 0.31 mL\/min (mean +\/- SD), and the inulin clearance was 3.85 +\/- 2.82 mL\/min. A negative correlation was found between the peritoneal net ultrafiltration rate and both the urinary volume excretion rate (r = -0.80, p &lt; 0.01) and the fractional sodium clearance (r = -0.69, p &lt; 0.05). In HD patients the urinary volume excretion increased from 0.36 +\/- 0.36 mL\/min during the initial eight hours of CP (HD-A) to 0.64 +\/- 0.29 mL\/min during the last ten hours of CP (HD-D, p &lt; 0.05), and the inulin clearance increased from 1.9 +\/- 1.3 (HD-A) to 2.9 +\/- 1.1 (HD-D, p &lt; 0.005). The fractional sodium clearance increased from 8.5 +\/- 5.7% (HD-A) to 14.4 +\/- 9.0% (HD-D, p &lt; 0.05). It can be concluded that the fractional excretion of volume and fractional clearance of solutes were similar in patients treated with CAPD and hemodialysis. The most important regulating factor seems to be the volume status influenced by volume removal by peritoneal net ultrafiltration in CAPD patients, and volume expansion during the interdialytic interval in hemodialysis patients.","891":"We have studied the economic cost of dialysis therapy in our area (public setting) during 1994, comparing the cost of different modalities of in-center hemodialysis (HD) and home peritoneal dialysis (PD). Analyzed costs included: personnel, drug expenditure, disposable (dialysis- and non-dialysis-related), laboratory, other services, indirect costs, maintenance and redemption, hospital admissions, transport, and home supplies. The final cost per patient and year (in 1994 US$) was: hemodiafiltration (AN69 filter, bicarbonate buffer) $58,890; HD polymethylmethacrylate filter and bicarbonate buffer $55,076; HD cuprophane and acetate buffer $49,767; CAPD $31,201; and cost of automated PD $42,519. The main expenditure sections were: home supply and hospital admissions for PD patients, and personnel, drug expenditures, disposable dialysis material, indirect costs, hospital admissions, and transport for HD patients. Home peritoneal dialysis therapy has a significantly lower economic cost than any in-center HD modality.","892":"There has been much debate recently whether peritoneal dialysis is an acceptable modality of renal replacement therapy in the diabetic patient. The authors review the recent continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) mortality literature and suggest that mortality can be improved by increasing the quantity of peritoneal dialysis delivered. The major disadvantages and advantages of CAPD are reviewed and presented. Peritoneal dialysis remains a viable modality of renal replacement therapy in the appropriate diabetic patient provided an adequate dose of dialysis is maintained.","893":"We have reviewed the literature and our own center's results for patients on long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in comparison to results for patients on hemodialysis (HD). Contrary to recent American data showing one-year survivals to be worse on CAPD, the Canadian Registry and other studies show no significant difference in survivals on the two methods. Results are also conflicting for diabetics. Insufficient adjustments for age and case-mix variations are probably the most important causes for differences. For the general population, personal Cox-adjusted data show no difference between CAPD and HD up to ten-year follow-up, with very close curves for the adults and non-significant differences for the elderly. Old elderly (&gt; 75 years) have better survival on CAPD in the first years of treatment. Dropout, which is higher on CAPD, decreases with age, and the patient retention on CAPD is worse than on HD for all patients, except the old elderly, for whom it is similar. These data were obtained in patients receiving a standard treatment, modified in order to give a more adequate dialysis dose only in recent years. The results of a prospective three-year study on the effect of nutritional [serum albumin and transferrin, normalized protein catabolic rate (PCRN), and subjective global assessment of malnutrition] and adequacy indices [Kt\/V, creatinine clearance (Ccr), residual renal function] on patient survival on CAPD and HD are reported. Survival was not different for the two methods. Using the Cox analysis, nutritional indices did not affect survival whereas adequacy indices did. The effect of low serum albumin on survival was referable to the predialysis nutritional state. The similar survivals obtained on CAPD and HD, with Kt\/V more or less than 1.0\/treatment for HD and 1.7\/week for CAPD, support the \"peak concentration hypothesis\" of Keshaviah et al. Survival in different groups of patients with different Kt\/V and Ccr shows that the adequate dose on CAPD is Kt\/V between 1.96 and 2.03 and Ccr &gt; or = 70 L\/week. A group of 26 patients who remained on CAPD treatment for more than eight years was also studied. Patient age and predialysis comorbidity were the most important factors affecting survival. Patients surviving longest had &gt; 3 g\/dL of serum albumin, &gt; 0.8 g\/kg\/day of PCRN, a Kt\/V &gt; 1.6, and a weekly Ccr &gt; 54L\/week.","894":"It is known that serum insulin-like growth factor binding protein-1 (IGFBP-1) concentrations are inversely related to insulin levels both in healthy and diabetic subjects. The aim of the present study was to assess serum IGFBP-1 levels in a group of patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD) and to evaluate their relationship with serum insulin concentrations. Thirty-five patients [19 males, 16 females; age (mean +\/- SEM) 53.2 +\/- 2.5 years; range 18-78; duration of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis 33.1 +\/- 6.0 months; Kt\/V 2.00 +\/- 0.05; normalized protein catabolic rate 1.00 +\/- 0.05 g\/kg\/day] were studied. Nine patients were diabetics. In all patients, baseline IGFBP-1, insulin, and growth hormone (GH) levels were determined. Fasting IGFBP-1 levels were elevated in 19 (54%) patients and were normal in 16 patients. In all patients, high levels of serum insulin levels (&gt; 25 microU\/mL) were observed. Baseline IGFBP-1 levels were only slightly higher in diabetic patients (53.7 +\/- 14.6 vs 40.5 +\/- 8.2 micrograms\/L,NS), however, serum levels of GH were similar in both groups (3.0 +\/- 1.8 vs 2.9 +\/- 0.5 microgram\/L, NS). There was no correlation between fasting insulin and IGFBP-1 levels both in the whole group (r = 0.2; NS) and the diabetic (r = 0.2; NS) and nondiabetic (r = 0.3; NS) subgroups, despite high fasting insulin levels. We could only find a significant positive correlation between fasting glucose and IGFBP-1 levels in the diabetic group (r = 0.7, p &lt; 0.05). Our data suggest that adult patients undergoing PD show hyperinsulinemia associated with normal or high serum IGFBP-1 levels. This suggests that insulin does not affect IGFBP-1 production in this group of patients. It could be explained, at least in part, by the insulin resistance present in uremia.","895":"To evaluate circulating burst-forming unit-erythroid (BFU-E) cells after erythropoietin (EPO) treatment, 7 female continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients were studied [baseline hemoglobin (HB): 7-10.5 g\/dL)]. EPO (4000 U subcutaneously) was administered twice weekly for two months. The control group consisted of 7 healthy women with similar demographic characteristics. Mononuclear cells (MC) (5 x 10(5)) were added to 1 mL of culture medium, supplemented with 30% fetal bovine serum, 2 U\/mL of EPO, 1% bovine serum albumin, and 0.3% agar. To enumerate colonies derived from each circulating BFU-E, plates were examined by inverse light microscopy, identifying BFU-E as large aggregates with more than 100 hemoglobinized cells (HC). A remarkable individual response was observed, with Hb values ranging 8.4-13.6 g\/dL at week 4 and 8.8-16.5 g\/dL at week 8. Baseline levels of BFU-E in patients ranged 0-100\/5 x 10(5) MC (0-358 mL of whole blood), and in controls they ranged 6-24\/5 x 10(5) MC (29.6-101.3\/mL) (NS). Hemoglobin levels after four and eight weeks of EPO showed a significant relationship with circulating BFU-E at baseline (r = -0.873, r = -0.928, respectively). The increment in Hb after eight weeks showed a significant relationship with baseline BFU-E (r = 0.812). Hemoglobin levels at the fourth to eighth week, and the increment in Hb after eight weeks, showed a significant, direct relationship with the increments in circulating BFU-E registered after one to two weeks of treatment. We conclude that, after the first week of EPO treatment, its effect on hemoglobin may be predieted by the increment in circulating BFU-E. Thus; a new tool to measure the earliest EPO effects has become available.","896":"The limitations of the ratio of estimated-over-predicted creatinine generation (E\/P) as an index of noncompliance were investigated in hypothetical continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) populations with steady-state E\/ P ranging between 0.5 and 1.5 (mean 1.0), anuria or urine creatinine clearance of 50 L weekly, and omission during the noncompliant state of one, two, or three daily exchanges from a schedule of four daily exchanges, which would provide, in the compliant state, a peritoneal creatinine clearance of 50 L weekly. Standard pharmacokinetic methods were applied to estimate both serum creatinine concentration at the end of the first 24-hour period after resumption of the schedule with four daily exchanges and the amount of creatinine lost from the body in the same nonsteady-state period. The shift of the E\/P frequency distribution curve to higher values between the steady and nonsteady states was sufficient to create a clear separation of these curves only in anuria with three-exchange daily noncompliance (nonsteady state: E\/P 1.02 - 3.04, with a mean of 2.03). In all other cases, the shift of the E\/P curve was small and did not create a clear separation of the E\/P frequency distribution curves. Because of the wide variation of the E\/P values in the steady state and the relatively small shift of E\/P distribution to higher values in the nonsteady state after a sudden increase in total creatinine clearance, E\/P is not a suitable test for noncompliance in cross-sectional studies.","897":"This study was undertaken in order to evaluate differences in pH, cytotoxicity, and concentration of glucose degradation products between different peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluids. Four brands of commercial PD fluids were selected: Gambrosol, Bieffe, Dianeal, and Lock-olys, with a glucose concentration between 3.86% and 4.25%. The cytotoxicity of unused PD fluid was measured as inhibition of cell growth after three days' exposure of a fibroblast cell line using neutral red vital stain. The concentration of 2-furaldehyde, 5-hydroxymethyl-furaldehyde (5-HMF), acetaldehyde, formaldehyde, glyoxal, and methylglyoxal was analyzed by high-performance liquid chromatography technique. All the investigated PD fluids were cytotoxic and contained noticeable amounts of aldehydes. No major differences were observed in pH, although one fluid with a slightly lower pH was found to be less cytotoxic. This fluid also contained less formaldehyde, acetaldehyde, methylglyoxal, and glyoxal but instead contained more 5-HMF. We conclude that all brands of PD fluid are cytotoxic due to glucose degradation products and that they contain noticeable concentrations of low-molecular aldehydes. Our results also demonstrate that the concentration of 5-HMF, used as a regulatory control of PD fluids, does not correlate well with cytotoxicity.","898":"In the mesenteric microcirculation, inhibition of nitric oxide (NO) synthesis results in an inflammatory response through increased leukocyte adherence to the microvascular postcapillary venular endothelium. Recent studies have demonstrated that elevated concentrations of endogenous NO synthesis inhibitors are present in renal failure. How peritoneal dialysis solutions may affect leukocyte-endothelial interactions during inflammation induced by NO synthesis inhibition has been previously unknown. Using in vivo intravital microscopy of the rat mesenteric postcapillary venules, microvascular leukocyte adherence was quantitated during baseline conditions in which the mesentery was superfused with a buffer solution, followed by the superfusion of a NO synthesis inhibitor NG-nitro-L-ARGININE methyl ester (L-NAME) added to the buffer, followed by 4.25% Dianeal (4.25% D). When compared to baseline, L-NAME increased the mean number of adherent leukocytes by fivefold (2.2 +\/- 0.9 vs 11.6 +\/- 3.6 leukocytes\/100 microns venule\/10 min, p &lt; 0.05), while 4.25% D quickly reversed the L-NAME-induced inflammatory response, returning the number of adherent leukocytes back to baseline values (11.6 +\/- 3.6 vs 2.4 +\/- 1.3 leukocytes\/100 microns venule\/ 10 min, p &lt; 0.05). These results confirm that NO synthesis inhibition induces inflammation in mesenteric postcapillary venules. Superfusion of 4.25% D reverses leukocyte adhesion induced by NO synthesis inhibition. Thus, a standard peritoneal dialysis solution (4.25% D) reverses the leukocyte-adhesive effects of NO synthesis inhibition in the mesenteric microcirculation.","899":"Lactate (L)-containing dialysate has a low pH, responsible for its poor biocompatibility. Dial-ysate-containing bicarbonate (B) with a physiological pH is available. We compare the peritoneal functional effects of these two solutions. Eight patients were studied two weeks apart using two consecutive peritoneal kinetic tests to determine convective and diffusive mass transfer coefficient (MTC) capacities for different solutes. Both L and B solutions were identical, except for pH and buffer content. Peritoneal equilibration values at four-hour dwell time were similar for all solutes, except for urea (B: 0.91 +\/- 0.05 vs L: 0.87 +\/- 0.06, p &lt; 0.05). Peritoneal MTC (B vs L) values for urea (19.6 +\/- 6.6 vs 18.2 +\/- 4.5), creatinine (8.8 +\/- 4.8 vs 7.8 +\/- 3.5), phosphate (7.7 +\/- 4.6 vs 6.0 +\/- 2.2), and potassium (13.3 +\/- 5.6 vs 11.7 +\/- 5.0) were slightly higher for B (NS). Glucose-MTC was slightly lower for B (6.2 +\/- 3.3 vs 7.5 +\/- 3.2, NS). Ultrafiltration (UF) was lower for B (drained volume: 2120 +\/- 204 vs 2443 +\/- 285 mL after 4 hr, p &lt; 0.05). Higher transperitoneal calcium [11 +\/- 22 L vs -3.1 +\/- 11.0 (positive balance) mg, p &lt; 0.05] and sodium (48 +\/- 30 L vs 13 +\/- 20 mEq) removal were evident. With L, the loss of 43.0 +\/- 6.3 mEq of bicarbonate appeared. The linear regression analysis of MTC values showed higher r coefficients for the bicarbonate solution. These results suggest that bicarbonate dial-ysate improves the diffusion capacity of the peritoneum with respect to lactate.","900":"A closed system kinetic modeling set (KMS) has been fabricated which permits collection of a small 100-mL aliquot from each exchange. The KMS was used to collect aliquots from 65 exchanges in 13 patients. The concentrations of urea nitrogen (UN), creatinine (Cr), glucose (G), and total protein (TP) were measured in each individual aliquot (Cka) and drain bag (Cba), and all aliquots for each dialysis treatment were used to calculate the concentrations expected in total batched dialysate (BaC) for the treatment and were compared to the measured concentrations (BaM) in mixed total dialysate. The ratios Cka\/Cba [mean+\/- two times coefficient of variation (mean +\/- 2CV)] were 1.00 +\/- 5%, 1.00 +\/- 5%, 1.01 +\/- 10%, and 1.00 +\/- 6%, respectively, for UN, Cr, G, and TP (each, n = 61). The ratios BaC\/BaM (mean +\/- 2CV) were 1.00 +\/- 2%, 1.00 +\/- 5%, 1.01 +\/- 3%, and 0.99 +\/- 5%, respectively, for UN, Cr, G, and TP (each, n = 15). We concluded that the KMS aliquots can be reliably used for kinetic and total clearance calculations without mixing and transporting large volumes of dialysate.","901":"A computerized urea kinetic model of peritoneal urea transport (PACK-PD) has been developed and used to calculate prescription parameters which would result in the prescribed weekly peritoneal urea clearance (pKpt\/V) required to achieve levels of weekly summed renal + peritoneal urea clearance (pKprt\/ V) targeted at 1.75 and 2.16. Baseline kinetic data were obtained and analyzed with PACK-PD on 88 patients, and the program then used these data to calculate the required pKpt\/V and subsequently the delivered Kpt\/V (dKpt\/V) from the dialysate collections. A total of 108 prescriptions were written and compared to dKpt\/V measured over one to 24 months in the 88 patients. Both continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis and automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) were studied (APD consisted of PD+ with one or two diurnal and two to four nocturnal cycler exchanges). The correlation of dKpt\/V to pKpt\/V showed r = 0.93 with 95% confidence limits (CL) on agreement of +\/-20% over a range of pKpt\/V 0.52-2.55. The 95% CL on (dKpt\/V-pKpt\/V) were +\/-0.30. We concluded: (1) that the prescription can be modeled as reliably in peritoneal dialysis as in hemodialysis (HD) where dKt\/V and pKt\/V agree to +\/-25%, (2) that any individual weekly dKpt\/V may vary as much as 0.3-0.4 from pKpt\/V, and (3) that frequent measurement of dKpt\/V and adjustment of pKpt\/V as needed are required (as in HD) to control mean dKpt\/V to within +\/-10% of mean pKpt\/V.","902":"The ascites in the chronic renal failure patient is often difficult to treat and becomes intractable. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), as a maintenance therapy, is effective in the removal of ascites and may become a good alternative in dialysis therapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the peritoneal membrane transport characteristics and ultrafiltration rate in CAPD patients who had preexisting ascites. Seven CAPD patients (6 male, 1 female; mean age 43 +\/- 11 years) were included. The causes of ascites were liver cirrhosis (n = 4), hemodialysis-associated process (n = 2), and heart failure (n = 1). A peritoneal equilibration test (PET) using 2.5% dialysate was performed by the standard method at ten days after starting CAPD. The solute transport rate [dialysate glucose ratio (D\/D6) and dialysate-to-plasma creatinine concentration ratio] showed high (n = 5) or high average (n = 2) transport. In 5 patients with high transport, PET showed a discrepancy between solute transport rate and drain volume. In spite of the high transport rate, the drain volume was greater than expected and corresponded to the area of low average or high average solute transport rate. Considering adequate solute clearance and good ultrafiltration, CAPD is an effective treatment in end-stage renal disease patients with intractable ascites.","903":"Plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) is involved in the accumulation of extracellular matrix in various tissues. Since peritoneal interstitium is one of the resistance sites for transport during peritoneal dialysis (PD), the peritoneal PAI-1 level may have a significant effect on peritoneal transport. It was the purpose of this study to examine the associations between plasma or dialysate PAI-1 levels and the variables of peritoneal transport during peritoneal equilibration tests (PET) in 25 stable, adult PD patients. The dialysate PAI-1 levels increased with dwell time. Hematocrit was a positive predictor of plasma PAI-1 concentration and the change of dialysate PAI-1 amount scaled by body surface area (delta DPAI\/ BSA). The peritoneal clearance of PAI-1 was higher than expected for its molecular size, suggesting a local production of PAI-1 in peritoneal tissue. The mass transfer coefficient of creatinine scaled by BSA (MTCcr\/BSA) was a positive predictor of delta D PAI\/BSA, suggesting the diffusion of plasma PAI-1 into the peritoneal cavity also accounted for part of the increased dialysate PAI-1 levels during PET. delta DPAI\/BSA was a positive predictor of MTC of urea (ur) MTCwr\/BSA and MTCcr\/BSA, parameters for diffusive transport. Our findings are consistent with the hypothesis that peritoneal PAI-1 level has a significant effect on peritoneal transport during PD.","904":"The pharmacological manipulation by vasodilators of peritoneal solutes and fluid kinetics was investigated. Rats were dialyzed for 240 minutes with 30 mL 4.25% glucose dialysate containing dextran 70. An angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitor (captopril), three calcium channel blockers (nicardipine, diltiazem, and verapamil), and an +\/-blocker (maxisylite) were administered intraperitoneally at various concentrations. Membrane permeability to urea, glucose, and protein, actual net ultrafiltration rate (UFR), transcapillary ultrafiltration rate (TCUFR), and peritoneal net fluid absorption rate (PNFAR) were measured. All three vasodilators caused a decrease in blood pressure, which, except for moxisylite, was associated with a decrease in net UFR. Captopril and the three calcium antagonists increased PNFAR dose dependently. Captopril increased membrane permeability to small and large molecular solutes, with a consequent decrease in TCUFR. Nicardipine and verapamil increased permeability to urea and glucose but not to protein. Only the latter decreased TCUFR. Diltiazem caused no change in permeability. In conclusion, various vasodilators administered intraperitoneally affect peritoneal solute and fluid transport differently. This should, perhaps, be taken into consideration when working with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients to whom antihypertensive drugs are administered in large doses.","905":"We studied the effects of bicarbonate dialysis solution (TB 1.36) on the peritoneum in our rat model of dialysis. Twenty-four male Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into two groups (n = 12 each). One group was dialyzed with standard 1.36% Dianeal PD-2 (L-group); the other group was dialyzed with TB 1.36 (B-group). After break-in dialysis after catheter insertion, the animals were dialyzed twice daily with 30 mL of the designated dialysis solution for four weeks. White blood cell count with differentials and microbiological culture of the dialysate were examined once a week to detect peritonitis. A peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was performed on the eighth and thirty-sixth days. The dialysate was obtained at 0, 2, and 4 hours; a blood sample was taken at 0 hour. Peritoneal tissue specimens were obtained after the second PET. Histological score was calculated based on the degree of thickening of the peritoneum. Five rats in L-group and three rats in B-group suffered from peritonitis. Two other rats in B-group had complications and did not complete the experiment. Therefore, seven rats from each group finished the experiment, and the PET data was analyzed. The peritoneal transport property of B-group did not change over time, while, in L-group it became less permeable on the thirty-sixth day. Fibrotic thickening of the peritoneum was observed in both groups, however, the histological score was slightly lower in B-group. These results suggest that the bicarbonate dialysis solution may be less harmful to the peritoneum.","906":"The aim of the studies was an evaluation of the correlation between effective peritoneal blood flow (EPBF), blood pressure, and peritoneal transfer during intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD). In 20 IPD patients it was shown that EPBF does not depend on either systolic or diastolic blood pressure. Differences in EPBF did not influence peritoneal transfer of small solutes and total protein during the first 25 minutes of dwell, but EPBF dependence of transfer was shown in the later periods of the dwell. Peritoneal transfer rates were greater with higher systolic blood pressure; the significant changes were shown at the beginning (for bicarbonate and total carbon dioxide), in the middle (for urea), and at the end (for uric acid) of the dwell time. Differences in diastolic pressure influenced peritoneal transfer predominantly during the first 25 minutes of dwell, although significant changes during the entire dwell were also observed. Our results indicate that the influence of both EPBF and blood pressure on transport kinetics depends on dwell time: in the first minutes of dwell diastolic blood pressure can predominantly contribute to transfer rates, in later periods the greater role of EPBF in the determination of transfer rates cannot be excluded.","907":"Previous studies have demonstrated that mesothelial cells (MC) are important in the local host defense system of the peritoneal cavity. Most studies on the function of MC are performed on MC derived from material of patients with normal renal function (NRF). The aim of the present study was to examine differences in interleukin (IL)-8 expression by MC from patients with NRF and from patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD). Therefore, MC were isolated from the omentum and pleural exudate of patients with NRF, from spent effluent of stable peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, and from omentum obtained during catheter implantation prior to PD treatment. MC were stimulated with increasing doses of IL-1 beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha for 24 hours, after which the supernatant was analyzed for IL-8 content. The IL-8 background level of MC isolated from patients with NRF was significantly lower than the IL-8 background level of MC derived from patients with ESRD. Although IL-8 production appeared to be higher in the ESRD MC, this difference was not significant after stimulation. While the overall immunity is depressed in uremia, MC are activated. The relatively high background of IL-8 might lead to an insensitivity of neutrophils by blocking the receptors and explain their impaired chemotaxis in uremia.","908":"In order to investigate which component of dialysate is responsible for mesothelial cell damage, we studied the chronic cytotoxicity to mesothelial cells by using four types of solution. Four different types of solution (Ringer's solution, lactate, high-concentrate glucose, and 4.25% Dianeal) were prepared and injected into the abdominal cavity of five ddY-mice, 5 mL every day for one month. The monolayer of the mesothelial cells was carefully removed from the liver surface by the imprint technique. Then, the mesothelial cell damage was evaluated by using trypan blue staining and comparing the results. Trypan blue-stained cells in 100 mm2 were observed in 7.0% of the control, 15.4% of the Ringer's solution, 18.7% of the lactate, 23.2% of the high-concentrate glucose, and 22.4% of the 4.25% Dianeal group, respectively. The damaged cells were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) greater in the 4.25% Dianeal group than in the control group, and those in the high-concentrate glucose group also appeared to be greater in number compared to the control group It is concluded from these results that damage to the mesothelial cells is induced by chronic exposure to high-glucose dialysate, and its pathogenesis is deeply related to high concentration of glucose.","909":"Hydrogen peroxide can be indirectly detected in mesothelial cells by measuring the rate of inhibition of the intracellular catalase activity by 3-amino-1, 2,3-triazole (AT). AT binds and inhibits catalase only in the presence of hydrogen peroxide, and the effect is proportional to the amount of hydrogen peroxide. The effect of AT on catalase activity is prevented in the presence of ethanol. In mesothelial cells in vitro exposed to dialysis fluids (Dianeal 1.36%, 2.27%, and 3.86%) no significantly increased generation of hydrogen peroxide was detected. However, interleukin-1 (IL-1) (10 ng\/mL) enhances, within two hours (+40%, p &lt; 0.05), intracellular production of hydrogen peroxide. The presented method of detection of intracellular hydrogen peroxide may be helpful in studies of the pathomechanisms causing mesothelial damage in conditions of peritoneal dialysis.","910":"Planimetric studies of peritoneal surface area were performed in 10 humans, 12 rabbits, and 15 rats. It was found that the total peritoneal surface area (TPSA) correlated in humans with body surface area (BSA) (r = 0.98, p &lt; 0.0001) and body weight (r = 0.93, p &lt; 0.001), and correlated in animals with body weight (r = 0.80, p &lt; 0.005 in rabbits; and r = 0.88, p &lt; 0.0001 in rats). The area of parietal peritoneum was 18.1 +\/- 1.8% of TPSA in humans, 17.8 +\/- 1.0% of TPSA in rabbits, and 22.6 +\/- 2.1% of TPSA in rats (p &lt; 0.001 vs humans and rabbits). Additionally, the area of peritoneum covering the individual organs (expressed as % of TPSA) was different in humans, rabbits, and rats: for example, the area of peritoneum covering the diaphragm was 6.4 +\/- 1.5% of TPSA in humans, which was larger than in animals (3.0 +\/- 0.3% in rats, p &lt; 0.0001 vs humans and rabbits; and only 2.1 +\/- 0.4% in rabbits, p &lt; 0.0001 vs humans). Presented results show that interspecies variation in the topography of the peritoneum should be taken into account when the results from experimental studies done on animals are extrapolated to humans.","911":"We evaluated the effect of increasing the volume of all exchanges (group A), increasing exchange frequency (group B), or increasing nocturnal exchange volume alone (group C) on dialysis urea and creatinine clearances (DUrCl and DCrCl, respectively) and on KT\/V in 20 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients (25 maneuvers in 20 patients). The average duration of the maneuver was 4.5 +\/- 2.1 months. In group A, a significant increase occurred in DCrCl and DUrCl. Residual renal function (RRF) decreased by an average of 0.5 mL\/min (not significant, NS). In group B, DUrCl increased by 19% (NS). RRF decreased significantly from 2.5 +\/- 1.0 mL\/min to 1.0 +\/- 0.6 mL\/min. In group C no changes were noted in dialysate clearances or RRF. In all groups KT\/V was maintained regardless of the maneuver employed and despite the changes in dialysis clearance observed in groups A and B. This stability is probably related to the significant decline in RRF for the group as a whole during the observation period. KT\/V can be maintained as RRF declines with either increases in dialysate volume or exchange frequency. However, efforts to increase KT\/V to higher mandated values will probably require changes in both dialysate volume and frequency.","912":"Increasing numbers of patients receive peritoneal dialysis using noncontinuous methods such as nightly intermittent peritoneal dialysis (NIPD) rather than continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). We hypothesized that blood solute levels before and after NIPD would be large enough to produce significant variability in formulas based on the continuous peritoneal dialysis (PD) model. We found no diurnal differences in serum creatinine in NIPD or CAPD. However, our data demonstrate a 7.9% difference in serum urea measurements from evening to morning in patients treated by NIPD. This mathematical difference contributes to a 6.3% difference in the calculated value of KT\/V and a 9.4% difference in the calculation of total urea clearance (liters per week) in these patients. By contrast, no difference in serum values or in calculated values of adequacy could be shown in patients on CAPD. These observations support the premise that CAPD represents a steady-state condition. NIPD patients demonstrate variability in serum levels of urea which may result in inaccurate calculations of dialysis adequacy. When blood samples are obtained in the morning soon after completing a cycle of NIPD, dialysis adequacy as measured by KT\/V or total urea clearance (but not by total creatinine clearance) may be systematically overestimated.","913":"We studied 51 patients (age 50 +\/- 15 years; weight 75 +\/- 17 kg; blood urea nitrogen 62 +\/- 20 mg\/dL), 61% of whom were obese. The volume of distribution of urea was estimated by anthropometric formulas (Watson and Hume) and as 58% of actual and ideal body weight. Volumes derived from use of 58% of actual body weight were highest (43.4 +\/- 10.0 kg; p = 0.0005); no differences were noted between Watson and Hume volumes and those obtained using 58% of ideal body weight (38.5 +\/- 8.0, 39.4 +\/- 7.5, and 37.0 +\/- 5.6 kg, respectively). Normalized daily urea clearance (KprT\/V) was lowest and highest when using 58% of actual and ideal body weight, respectively (0.251 +\/- 0.081 and 0.290 +\/- 0.091; p &lt; 0.0001). KprT\/V values derived using the Watson and Hume methods were similar (0.279 +\/- 0.081 and 0.274 +\/- 0.083, respectively), but significantly lower than those obtained using actual body weight (p &lt; 0.0001). Differences were magnified in obese patients. A subset of patients underwent hemodialysis for urea volume measurement by urea kinetic modeling. Volume estimates using bioelectrical impedance showed the least bias when compared to values calculated during a hemodialysis treatment. We conclude that KprT\/V is very dependent on body habitus and the method used for volume determination. Standardization of the volume parameter is essential to defining therapeutic guidelines and for meaningful comparisons between centers.","914":"Currently, weekly KT\/V and weekly creatinine clearance (WCC) are used to quantitate continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), the minimum recommended requirements being 1.7\/week and 50 L\/week, respectively. There is no substantial evidence that one index is better than the other, and there is no clear recommendation what one should do if there is a discrepancy between these two values. We performed a cross sectional analysis of 68 patients in whom we measured weekly KT\/V, WCC, residual clearances, and a 4-hr peritoneal equilibration test (PET). The correlation between KT\/V and WCC in the whole group was highly significant (p &lt; 0.0001); when patients were divided in the four PET groups, there was a significant correlation (p &lt; 0.05) in the low-average (n = 22) and high-average (n = 21) PET groups, but the correlation was not significant in the high (n = 13) and low (n = 12) PET groups. Fourteen of 68 patients (20%) showed a discrepancy between KT\/V and WCC: 7 patients had a KT\/V &lt; 1.7 and WCC &gt; or = 50 (group 1), and 7 patients had a KT\/V &gt; or = 1.7 and WCC &lt; 50 (group 2). Those in group 1 with a WCC &gt; 50 had a higher residual renal function (0.82 vs 0.11 mL\/min, p &lt; 0.05) than those in group 2 and therefore had a higher tubular secretion of creatinine and reabsorption of urea. Those in group 2 with a KT\/V &gt; 1.7 had lower creatinine equilibration than those in group 1 (D\/Pcr 0.56 vs 0.75, p &lt; 0.05) and therefore a better removal of urea than creatinine.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","915":"The aim of this study was to examine the possibility of increasing sodium and water removal with peritoneal dialysis. Ten patients aged 67.3 +\/- 6.2 years, on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for 28.1 +\/- 13.9 months, with no episodes of peritonitis for at least 2 months and clinically normohydrated, gave their informed consent to undergo two consecutive peritoneal equilibration tests (PETs) with dialysis solution at a sodium concentration of 126 mEq\/L (low sodium) and 132 mEq\/L (normal sodium), both with 2.5% glucose. Net ultrafiltration and sodium mass transfer were 319.4 +\/- 178.5 and 443.2 +\/- 234.4 mL (p = 0.0346) and 27.7 +\/- 24.5 and 28.2 +\/- 27.1 mEq (p = NS), respectively. There were no variations in natremia or the transport indices of the studied solutes or in the arterial pressure or heart rate. All patients showed drowsiness or torpor during the low sodium PET and one had cramps. The 126 mEq\/L sodium dialysis solution showed no advantages compared to the more common solution, 132 mEq\/L. However, further study is necessary to check the potentiality of solutions with different sodium and glucose compositions for both acute and chronic use.","916":"The prevalence of hypotension in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients varies between 10% and 16%. The main causes of hypotension in these patients include hypovolemia, antihypertensive medications, myocardial failure, and a variety of poorly understood causes, viz, severe autonomic neuropathy, amyloidosis, malignancies, adrenal insufficiency, removal of vasopressor substances by dialysis and steroid withdrawal. In addition, there are a large number of patients with hypotension due to unknown causes. Between 1989 and 1994 we had 65 of 525 CAPD patients suffering from persistent hypotension. Sixteen (25%) patients were hypovolemic, 14 improved after increasing the target weight, but 2 did not because of concurrent administration of coronary vasodilators. The various steps in the treatment of this group include fluid repletion after discontinuing anti-hypertensive medications and excluding myocardial failure, oral sodium supplementation and possibly increasing the dialysate sodium. Preventive measures include frequent assessment of the hydration status. Judicious use of diuretics is also important. Bioelectrical impedance and inferior vena caval ultrasound are two promising tools to assess the fluid status and supplement careful clinical examination.","917":"The peritoneum's response to peritoneal dialysis is a complex and poorly understood process that can result in fibrosis. The transforming growth factor beta(TGF-beta 1) plays a central role in regulating tissue repair and remodeling after injury. To determine the role of mesothelial cells during peritoneal dialysis in the alteration of the peritoneum, we studied the effect of glucose on TGF-beta 1 expression by mesothelial cells. Human mesothelial cells were cultured in serum-free DMEM with different glucose concentrations for 48 hours. TGF-beta 1 messenger (mRNA) was measured by slot-blot hybridization using a TGF-beta 1 cDNA probe. The result was that glucose stimulates TGF-beta 1 mRNA expression in a dose-dependent way. The expression was more profound in high glucose concentrations. This suggests that TGF-beta 1 mRNA may overexpress by mesothelial cells due to the procedure of dialysis, which may be the most important mechanism of alteration of the peritoneum during peritoneal dialysis.","918":"Reabsorption of peritoneal dialysis fluid during the prolonged dwell time of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) reduces the efficiency of ultrafiltration and sacrifices effective dialysis adequacy. Studies by Nolph indicate a predominant role of lymphatics in this fluid loss. Khanna has reported that lymphatic flow may be influenced by acetylcholine. This study was designed to determine if bethanechol chloride (BC) would increase the availability of drained volume during CAPD. Nine patients were studied, including 7 patients who exhibited inadequate ultrafiltration. During a 5-day control period, total dialysate drained volume was collected and a standard peritoneal equilibration test (PET) performed. This was followed by a corresponding 5-day test period in which BC (mean dose 0.27 +\/- 0.13 mg\/kg\/day) was administered orally. Drained volume during the control standard 4-hr PET was 1996.68 +\/- 279.87 mL. The result for the test period was 2363.33 +\/- 321.13 mL (p &lt; 0.05), indicating an 18.4% increase using BC. The PET indicated no change in transport of urea, creatinine, and glucose. In conclusion, the total drained volume can be effectively increased with a subsequent increase in metabolite clearance using BC. Patients exhibiting inadequate ultrafiltration were able to be maintained on CAPD using this cholinergic drug.","919":"Microangiopathy has been observed in the peritoneum of diabetic patients, and an increase in vascular permeability to small and large molecules has been described in the skeletal muscle of diabetic patients. Therefore, we examined the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) data from 19 diabetic and 19 nondiabetic stable peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. These two groups of patients were matched in terms of age, gender, duration of PD and hypertension, incidence of peritonitis, levels of blood pressure, degree of uremia, levels of serum lipids, hematocrit, weekly KT\/V, and body surface area. Compared to the nondiabetics, the diabetics had higher dialysate-to-serum ratios or mass transfer coefficients of urea or creatinine. These differences were not related to their differences in serum sodium or glucose. Regression analysis showed that the duration of hypertension was a negative determinant of peritoneal transport of urea and creatinine in diabetic patients. Our results suggest that the diabetic patients had a higher peritoneal diffusive transport of small solutes, which was offset by their duration of hypertension.","920":"Alterations in the fibrinolytic system have been demonstrated in noninsulin-dependent diabetic patients (NIDDM) but not in insulin-dependent diabetic patients (IDDM). Since the activity of the fibrinolytic system can affect the turnover of extracellular matrix and therefore theoretically can affect the peritoneal transport, we tried to determine if there was a difference in the performance of the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) between IDDM and NIDDM patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD). The PET data from 11 IDDM patients (2 female, 9 male) and 13 NIDDM patients (3 female, 10 male) were reviewed. These two groups of patients were matched in gender, duration of end-stage renal disease, PD, and hypertension, blood pressure, degree of uremia, weekly KT\/V, and body surface area. The IDDM patients (41.4 +\/- 13.9 years) were younger than the NIDDM patients (58.8 +\/- 7.1 years, p = 0.0026). There were no differences in hematocrit and serum chemistry profile including glucose and albumin between the two groups. Our data showed that there was no difference in PET performance between IDDM and NIDDM patients.","921":"We investigated the absorption rate and acute toxicities of intraperitoneal iron dextran in rats. Eighteen Sprague-Dawley rats were divided into three groups (n = 6). The animals were given standard 1.5% Dianeal (group 1) or 1.5% Dianeal containing iron in a concentration of 2 mg\/L (group 2) or 10 mg\/L (group 3) as iron dextran. First, a predialysis blood sample was obtained, and 25 mL of the designated dialysis solution was instilled into the peritoneal cavity. After a 6-hour cycle the dialysate was drained, and a postdialysis blood sample and specimen of the peritoneum were obtained. The iron concentrations of the dialysis solution, the dialysate, and both serum samples were determined. Histological samples were processed by hematoxylin and eosin and Prussian blue stain. Results of the iron concentration (mg\/L) of the dialysis solution, the dialysate, and the percent of the absorbed iron were as follows: group 1: 0.00, 0.20 +\/- 0.15, N\/A; group 2: 2.24, 0.66 +\/- 2.8, 73.8 +\/- 11.0; group 3: 9.84, 2.12 +\/- 0.62, 80.8 +\/- 5.7. The serum iron concentration did not change. No abnormal findings were found histologically. More than 70% of the iron dextran was absorbed from the peritoneal cavity of the rats during a 6-hour peritoneal dialysis exchange. Intraperitoneal iron dextran may be an alternative route of iron delivery.","922":"To investigate characteristics of peritonitis in rats on peritoneal dialysis (PD), we retrospectively studied 36 cases of peritonitis in 23 rats. After breakin dialysis postcatheter insertion, the animals were dialyzed twice daily with 1.5% or 4.25% Dianeal for 8 weeks. White blood cell (WBC) count with differentials and microbiological culture of the dialysate were examined twice weekly. Peritonitis was treated with cefazolin and tobramycin until the tenth day after the dialysate became clear. The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was performed at weeks 2, 6, and 10. The dialysate was obtained at 0, 2, and 4 hours for glucose assay. The peritoneal cavity was inspected, and peritoneal tissue specimens were taken. There were 10 single episodes of peritonitis, 7 recurrences, and 6 reinfections. The organisms isolated were Staphylococcus aureus in 24 cases of peritonitis and Escherichia coli in 6 cases of peritonitis. The average treatment period was 16 days. The glucose absorption ratio became higher over time in single episodes of peritonitis, but was unchanged in recurrences and reinfections. Sixteen adhesions, 1 abscess, and 12 sclerotic retractions of the mesentery were observed. Fibrotic thickening of the peritoneum was found histologically in all animals. In spontaneous peritonitis in rats, we often found complicated clinical courses, catheter closure, intraperitoneal adhesion, and fibrotic thickening of the peritoneum.","923":"The aim of this study was to establish a rat model of peritoneal fibrosis. After insertion of peritoneal catheters into 18 rats, the rats were divided into three groups. All animals were dialyzed twice a day with 4.25% Dianeal containing heparin. Group 1 rats (control) received antibiotics (vancomycin and gentamicin) in each exchange: group 2 rats were inoculated with Escherichia coli (5 x 10(6) in 5 mL of saline) at the beginning of the study; group 3 rats were treated with antibiotics after Escherichia coli inoculation; they also received a second inoculation of Escherichia coli after the second week of the study. By the end of the second week, group 2 rats were sacrificed because of catheter problems. Group 1 and 3 rats were sacrificed after 4 weeks of dialysis. A weekly peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was performed in each rat. The comparison of the PET results from the beginning and end of the study showed an increased permeability to glucose (p &lt; 0.05) and total protein (p &lt; 0.05) in group 3, which was not noted in group 1. In histology samples there was only delicate fibrosis with cellular infiltration in the peritoneum in group 1 rats. These changes were much more prominent in group 3 rats. This study suggests that E. coli peritonitis causes peritoneal fibrosis in rats, but to have a sclerosing encapsulating peritonitis (SEP) model this experiment must be carried out for a longer time.","924":"Residual volume is defined as the volume of dialysate remaining in the peritoneal cavity after complete drainage of fluid. In this study the residual volume was estimated in 9 patients, age 42 +\/- 9 years, on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for 14 +\/- 12 months, using two different solutes: dextran 70 and potassium. The residual volume was calculated from the change induced in drain dialysate solute concentration by the known volume and solute concentration of the newly infused dialysis solution. The residual volume estimated with dextran 70 was 195 +\/- 105 mL (75-375 mL) and with potassium 411 +\/- 108 mL (245-596 mL) (K &gt; D, p &lt; 0.001). The correlation between these two measurements was close to significance (r = 0.654; p = 0.056). In conclusion, potassium overestimates the residual volume, probably because of its rapid diffusion during the infusion time.","925":"To assess the effect of hematocrit (Hct) on peritoneal transport indices (PTi), we studied the relationship between Hct (mean 28.1 +\/- 5.1%, range 19.1-41.3%) and PTi with 118 peritoneal equilibration tests (PETs; 270 min, 1.36%) on 52 stable patients on peritoneal dialysis. Furthermore, considering a Hct 30% as ideal in peritoneal dialysis (PD), 14 patients who had performed a PET both with a Hct &lt;30% and &gt; or = 30% were checked for any variations in the PTi and blood pressure. We analyzed the subsequent PTi: ultrafiltration; creatinine (Cr) and blood urea nitrogen (BUN) clearance and mass transfer area coefficient (MTAC); 120, 240, and 270 min Cr D\/P, UN D\/P and glucose D\/D0. Linear regressions between Hct and the PTi (118 PETs) did not prove statistically significant. The analysis of the PTi in 14 patients who had performed a PET with both a Hct &lt; 30% and &gt; or = 30% did not prove statistically significant, and no change in blood pressure was demonstrated. We do not consider Hct to have a significant influence on PTi.","926":"During continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) peritoneal vessels are dilated. Nitric oxide (NO) causes vasodilation in many organs. Nitrate, a stable metabolite of NO, was measured in plasma and dialysate. In 6 stable CAPD patients standard peritoneal analyses were performed. The mass transfer area coefficient (MTAC) of nitrate was 11.5 mL\/min (10.0-17.0 mL\/min) (median and range). The MTAC of creatinine was of the same order of magnitude: 10.7 mL\/min (8.0-14.2 mL\/min), although the molecular weight of nitrate is lower (62 vs 113 dalton). The correlation between the MTAC of nitrate and the MTAC of creatinine indicated diffusion from the circulation and not local production of NO (r = 0.71; p = 0.11). Peritoneal permeability is increased in the acute phase of peritonitis, partly caused by extensive vasodilation. The potential role of NO during peritonitis was investigated in 8 CAPD patients with 11 peritonitis episodes in the acute phase and after recovery. The median dialysate\/plasma (D\/P) ratio of nitrate in the acute phase was 1.47 (range 0.96-2.55), which was higher than after recovery: 1.07 (0.99-1.75), p &lt; 0.05. No relation was found between the D\/P ratio of nitrate and the D\/P ratio of TNF alpha (tumor necrosis factor). In conclusion, dialysate nitrate levels in stable CAPD patients are likely to be determined by diffusion from the circulation. D\/P ratios exceeding 1.0 during the acute phase of peritonitis are probably the result of local NO production. This may contribute to the marked vasodilation during peritonitis.","927":"It was shown elsewhere that in a peritoneally dialyzed woman with pulmonary tuberculosis, oral treatment with rifampicin and pyrazinamide (11 and 25 mg\/kg\/day, respectively) caused a decrease in the peritoneal transport of sodium, potassium, urea, uric acid, protein, and ultrafiltration rate by 48% to 75% compared to the pretreatment values. Pyrazinoic acid (PA), a metabolite of pyrazinamide, may account for these changes, because rifampicin was also previously used in this patient without peritoneal function impairment. Thus in the present study the influence of PA on the human peritoneum is examined using the modified Ussing-type chamber. PA (1 mg\/dL) was introduced into the medium on the interstitial side of the membrane. After the introduction of PA, uric acid transfer from the interstitial to the mesothelial side decreased by about 50%. There were no significant changes in the urea and albumin transfer rates. In conclusion, PA induces changes in uric acid transfer acting directly on mesothelial cells, whereas a decrease in the peritoneal transfer of other solutes may be caused by a decrease in convective transfer rates due to impaired ultrafiltration.","928":"Dialysis adequacy is monitored by urea kinetic modeling (UKM), in particular by calculation of KT\/V (normalized whole body urea clearance) and PCRN (normalized protein catabolic rate). All children on peritoneal dialysis from our unit (7 children; mean age 7 years, 8 months) participated in our study (dialysis research program of the French Registry of Peritoneal Dialysis). Every month analysis of dialysate and urine collections and blood samples were compared to a 3-day diet survey to analyze the relations between doses of dialysis (KT\/V) and nutrition [dietary protein intake (DPI) and caloric intake]. Calculated protein intake and DPI were also compared. Spearman correlation coefficients were used to assess the association between variables. KT\/V values were spread over a wide range (0.8-2.8, mean 1.9). KT\/V was positively (weakly) correlated to PCRN (p = 0.07, y = 0.24x + 1.08, r = 0.2), but not to DPI. No correlation could be found between PCRN and DPI, but doses of dialysis (KT\/V) were positively correlated to caloric intake (p = 0.001, y = 28.97x + 13.66, r = 0.424). We assume that the correlation between KT\/V and PCRN is not necessarily the reason, but only a calculation effect. On the contrary, the positive correlation between KT\/V and caloric intake allows us to speculate that more efficient dialysis enhances appetite.","929":"The optimal approach to catheter exit-site care and catheter design in terms of catheter-related infections (e.g., exit-site infections, peritonitis) in children remains elusive. We retrospectively compared the incidence of exit-site infections and peritonitis in 33 pediatric peritoneal dialysis patients who used one of three exit-site care\/catheter combinations. The catheters used were single-cuffed, curled Tenckhoff (T), and double-cuffed Swan neck (SN). Exit-site care included either povidone-iodine (PI) or chlorhexidine (CHL) as cleansing agents. Our data suggest that the use of chlorhexidine versus povidone-iodine is associated with a significant decrease (p &lt; 0.05) in the frequency of catheter exit-site infections in children. The use of the Swan-neck double-cuffed catheter does not appear to have any further impact on the frequency of exit-site infections. Neither the use of chlorhexidine nor Swan neck catheters had an effect on our peritonitis rate. Our review suggests that a prospective evaluation of a chlorhexidine-based exit-site care regimen in children should be encouraged.","930":"Mesothelial cells in vitro exhibited binding sites for L-quinuclidinyl[phenyl-4-3H]-benzilate ([3H]-QNB), but not [3H]-N-methylscopolamine (NMS), a cell-impermeable ligand. [3H]-QNB binding demonstrated a biphasic pattern of binding in living cells: a maximum after 15 min at 37 degrees C was followed by a decrease out to 90 min. [3H]-QNB binding was blocked by increasing concentrations of atropine; WIN35428 and GBR12909, dopamine transport inhibitors also decreased binding. Pretreatment of cells for 18 hours with atropine, QNB, or WIN35428 resulted in enhanced [3H]-QNB binding, but coexposure to cycloheximide blocked this increase. Hyperosmolarity caused by NaCl or mannitol decreased binding of [3H]-QNB to living cells. Thus rabbit peritoneal mesothelial cells possess binding sites for [3H]-QNB that are influenced by other drugs and osmolarity.","931":"A recent treatment update for continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD)-associated peritonitis recommends first-line use of continuously or intermittently administered intraperitoneal vancomycin and ceftazidine. Teicoplanin has recently been introduced as a potentially less toxic alternative glycopeptide antibiotic. However, efficacy and safety have not been demonstrated for intermittent treatment schedules or for the use of teicoplanin in prospective studies. Therefore, a prospective trial on the treatment of CPD-associated peritonitis was started in 15 pediatric dialysis units using vancomycin or teicoplanin, in combination with ceftazidine. Vancomycin or teicoplanin was administered either continuously with each bag of dialysate for 10 days or as a single dose on days 1 and 8, and ceftazidime either continuously or in one bag of dialysate per day. Until December 31, 1994, 81 episodes of peritonitis including 16 relapses occurred in a cohort of 120 patients. The incidence of peritonitis was 1 episode\/13.7 months, regardless of treatment modality [continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD)]. Thirty-six (57%) primary peritonitis episodes were caused by staphylococci (21 Staphylococcus aureus, 15 coagulase-negative), 12 (19%) by gram-negative bacteria, 7 by other germs, and in 8 (13%) cases cultures remained sterile. Primary treatment response was achieved in 43\/46 (93%) gram-positive and 4\/12 (33%) gram-negative peritonitis episodes. Relapses occurred only with gram-positive bacteria (16\/63, 25%). In cases of gram-positive peritonitis, no differences in primary response (25\/25 vs 15\/18) or relapse rates (10\/36 vs 6\/27) were observed between groups on continuous and intermittent treatment, respectively.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","932":"A routine omentectomy is recommended in children commencing chronic peritoneal dialysis, but is not routine practice in adults. We reviewed the outcome of 66 catheters (57 straight and 9 spiral) inserted into 38 patients (median age 7.8 years, 12 patients under 2 years) over a period of 4.8 years. The aim of the study was to determine whether an omentectomy affects the incidence of catheter blockage or peritonitis. Mean catheter life was 6.8 months (range 0.2-28 months). Fifteen are still in situ, and 14 were removed electively (transplantation). Blockage occurred in 1\/22 catheters inserted after an omentectomy, compared with 10\/44 inserted without an omentectomy (absolute risk reduction with omentectomy = 0.18). Blockage was more frequent with spiral catheters (4\/9 vs 7\/57; p &lt; 0.05). Thirty-seven catheters were associated with one or more episodes of peritonitis. Peritonitis was not significantly more frequent after omentectomy. We conclude that a routine omentectomy is not routinely indicated in children commencing chronic peritoneal dialysis. Eleven omentectomies are required to prevent two omental blockages (1\/0.18), and secondary omentectomy after blockage is a straightforward procedure. Spiral catheters conferred no benefit in this study. Omentectomy does not influence the incidence of peritonitis.","933":"To determine standard peritoneal access practices in North American children, a questionnaire was distributed to the 18 participating centers of the Pediatric Peritoneal Dialysis Study Consortium. The survey covered areas including catheter placement, postoperative catheter break-in, chronic catheter care, and treatment of exit-site and tunnel infection.","934":"Continuous quality improvement (CQI) principles and practices were utilized to evaluate the outpatient peritoneal dialysis follow-up process and the routine monthly laboratory testing of chronic dialysis patients. CQI enabled us to reduce total clinic visit time from a mean of 161 min to 90.8 min. Waiting was decreased from a mean of 51.6 min to 15.8 min. The number of routine monthly laboratory tests performed on patients undergoing chronic dialysis was also reduced, resulting in decreased charges of at least $429.50 per patient per month.","935":"Chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) is the first treatment modality for most infants with end-stage renal failure; this group of patients shows peculiar clinical and technical problems. We present the data from a National Registry on 22 children starting CPD under one year of age, representing 11.6% of the total population of the Registry (189 patients). Mean weight at start of CPD was 6.1 +\/- 1.8 kg and duration of dialysis was 22.1 +\/- 15.5 months. During the follow-up period, 9 patients were transplanted, 1 was shifted to hemodialysis, and 4 died. Patient survival was 89.1% and 82.2% at 1 and 2 years (97.9% and 96.5% in the group of 167 older children); technique survival results were 89.1% at 1 year and 77.1% at 2 years (vs 92.5% and 85.7%, respectively). The incidence of peritonitis was 1 episode every 15.6 CPD-months (1:16.1 in the older children). Catheter-related complications occurred more frequently in infants (1:11.8 vs 1:17 episode:CPD-months), even if this difference was not statistically significant. Statural growth was on average -0.29 +\/- 0.66 SD\/year with a significant improvement between the first (-0.50 +\/- 0.79) and the second (+0.23 +\/- 0.77) year of CPD. Our data confirm that infants represent a higher risk group and that they can be treated satisfactorily with CPD while awaiting renal transplantation.","936":"Effective peritoneal capillary blood flow (EPBF) was evaluated by calculating the diffusive mass transport coefficient of carbon dioxide during intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD) performed with the intraperitoneal administration of sodium nitroprusside (NP), chlorpromazine (CP), or isoproterenol (IP) in the doses 5, 2.5, and 0.5 mg\/L, respectively. Peritoneal transfer rates of substances of different molecular size and charge were simultaneously examined and compared with EPBF. EPBF (mL\/min) was 220 +\/- 40 (+\/- SEM) for NP (n = 11), 224 +\/- 29 for CP (n = 10), and 243 +\/- 35 for IP (n = 10). These values did not differ significantly from those obtained during dialysis without drugs (223 +\/- 22 mL\/min, n = 20). NP, CP, and IP did not cause any significant changes in peritoneal transfer of carbon dioxide. Transfer rates of bicarbonate and total carbon dioxide were increased only with NP. All drugs enhanced the peritoneal removal of sodium, potassium, urea, and uric acid. Total protein loss was enhanced by all drugs except IP. With statistically similar EPBF during dialysis, the augmenting effect of NP and IP on small solute removal was the most pronounced. These results indicate that EPBF is not a major factor in the changes in peritoneal transfer rates during dialysis performed with NP, CP, or IP.","937":"Peritoneal dialysis (PD) success depends on adequate renal function replacement. Reports in adult dialysis populations indicate the risk of ultrafiltration failure (UF) increases with the time on dialysis. Type 1 UF is the most common. For children, dialysis modalities are temporizing measures until renal transplantation, considered optimal therapy for end-stage renal disease in children, can be performed. Children are frequently on dialysis for less than 2 years prior to transplantation. Thus if type 1 UF frequency increases with time on dialysis, it would be expected to occur less frequently in children, because they often are on dialysis for shorter periods. A retrospective chart review was performed to determine the cause of ultrafiltration failure in children; 172 children, mean age 8.0 +\/- 5.5 (SD) years received a mean of 15 +\/- 11.9 (SD) months of chronic PD; 39 patients received only continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, 18 received only continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis, 22 received only tidal PD, and 94 received more than one type of PD. Ten patients (5.8%) developed type 2 UF failure as sequellae of atypical peritonitis, Candida albicans (6 patients), Mycobacterium foruitum (2), Achromatium spp. (1), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (1). There was no significant difference in time on dialysis for children who developed membrane failure. No patients with type 1 or type 3 UF could be identified. It appears that the causes of peritoneal membrane failure in children are different from those in adults.","938":"There are little aggregate data that examine attributes of peritoneal dialysis (PD) training programs for children. We determined characteristics of pediatric home PD training programs in a sample of 54 centers in the NAPRTCS PD registry by telephone interview. Sixty-seven percent of the programs trained pediatric patients only (P-only); 33% were combined pediatric\/adult (P\/A) programs; 33 programs had dedicated training rooms. Most programs trained 5 to 8 patients\/year; only 2 trained more than 12 patients\/year. Forty-eight of 54 programs (89%) taught both automated and manual PD techniques; the preferred type of PD varied. All units preferred to train 2 people. The patient was often one of the trainees, but the minimal eligible age varied greatly. The patients were trained as inpatients (IP) in 38 units (70%) and as outpatients (OP) in 16 units (30%). P-only programs were less likely to train as OP (20%) than P\/A programs (50%) (p &lt; 0.01). There was no difference in the mean training time for P-only versus P\/A programs. However, training that took more than 6 days occurred more often when done as an IP (79%) than as an OP (56%) (p = 0.057). Furthermore, only 25% of IP units that took more than 6 days to train offered training on the weekend; none of the IP units that took more than 10 days offered weekend training. In conclusion, the structure of PD training programs for children in the United States varies tremendously. OP training is usually shorter in duration and potentially more cost-effective.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","939":"Antibody responses to currently recommended immunizations in pediatric patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis (CPD) have been measured and the results have been variable. Although the incidence of vaccine-preventable disease in pediatric CPD patients is not known, it appears that protection from these diseases may be reduced. The explanation for the abnormal response to vaccines might include lower seroconversion rates in these patients, with lower antibody titers or levels. Also a rapid decline of antibody levels or titers may occur as a consequence of continuous peritoneal dialysis. Specific vaccines that may result in a less than optimal response in pediatric CPD patients include hepatitis B virus, hemophilus influenza type b, measles, mumps, rubella and pneumococcal vaccine. Patients who receive these immunizations should be monitored closely. Increased vaccine dosage, reinforced vaccination schedules, as well as concomitantly administered adjuvant immuno-modulators may play an important role in more effective vaccination of pediatric CPD patients. It is important that vaccine response be monitored in these patients by measuring specific antibody titers or levels to ensure adequate protection from vaccine-preventable illness.","940":"To assess the outcome of infants on chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD), we retrospectively reviewed 21 patients who began PD prior to one year of age. Mean age at first dialysis was 56 +\/- 56 days with mean weight of 3.6 +\/- 1.6 kg. Seventeen infants were male and 17 were Caucasian. The most common primary renal diagnosis was renal hypoplasia\/dysplasia, occurring in 7 infants. Mean time on PD was 10 +\/- 10 months. Eleven infants had oliguria, and 10 infants had adequate urine output. All but 1 infant received tube feedings; mean caloric intake was 453 +\/- 92 kJ\/kg\/day. Despite nutritional management, weight, height, and head circumference was at or above the fifth percentile in only 10, 4, and 5 infants, respectively. Nonrenal abnormalities were present in 12 of 21 infants with lung, heart, and central nervous system abnormalities occurring most often. Outcome included 7 receiving renal transplants, 1 who recovered renal function, 4 who continued on PD, and 9 who died. Seven infants with oliguria died, while only 2 infants with adequate urine output died. No infant with isolated renal disease died, while 9 of 12 patients with renal plus nonrenal abnormalities died. Thus mortality in infants less than one year of age on PD appears to be associated with the presence of oliguria and nonrenal abnormalities.","941":"The use of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) in patients undergoing dialysis has not received substantial investigation. The available data would indicate that short-term growth velocity is improved with rhGH in children undergoing both peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. However, definitive assessment awaits long-term controlled studies. Although definitive studies are lacking, it does not appear that there is a differential effect of rhGH in the various dialytic modalities. Compared to patients with chronic renal insufficiency, the response to rhGH treatment in children undergoing dialysis appears inferior; however, definitive data are also lacking. rhGH is effective when administered intraperitoneally; however, long-term studies are required to substantiate efficacy. In summary, despite limited data, rhGH appears to be effective in growth-retarded children undergoing dialysis.","942":"We wanted continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) patients to become more cognitive of the complications of high-serum phosphorus levels (&gt; 6.0 mg\/dL). The phosphorus self-monitoring program was designed to encourage patients to be more responsible for preventing the complications of renal osteodystrophy. Patients' phosphorus levels were graphed monthly on a poster in the exam room. Additional posters discussed their responsibilities to control phosphorus and the complications associated with hyperphosphatemia. All patients received an informative letter regarding the inception of the program in March 1994 and also were assured total anonymity of their laboratory results. At monthly clinic appointments, they received additional written information on phosphorus and discussed their phosphorus levels. Our teaching method proved effective in our CAPD\/CCPD population. In March 1994, 31% of our patients had a phosphorus level greater than 6.0 mg\/dL versus 10% in September 1994. The ability of patients to see their monthly progress and the comparison with other patients encouraged much interest and questions regarding phosphorus control.","943":"Renal osteodystrophy is a virtually universal complication of chronic renal failure (CRF). Varying degrees of calcium-phosphate metabolism derangement and different types of skeletal damage are observed in CRF for many reasons while the use of dialysis for the management of end-stage renal failure further affects these complications. This study was designed to evaluate the bone mineral density (BMD) that is measured by dual-energy x-ray in three groups of patients: A, 10 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD); B, 10 patients on hemodialysis (HD); and C, 10 predialytic patients with advanced CRF. All patients were matched for age, sex, duration of dialysis (&gt; 3 years), and the use of phosphate binders. Biochemical (serum iPTH levels, SAP, Ca, P) and radiological bone studies were compared in the three groups. The majority of predialytic patients had BMD values within the normal range, while the BMD values in PD patients were higher (0.985 g\/cm2) in comparison with HD patients (0.949 g\/cm2). Some patients, especially in the HD population, showed an increase in BMD with time on dialysis. From all other comparisons, radiological signs of high turnover bone disease and osteopenia were the only variables that were correlated with BMD. All these findings suggest that dialysis affects the bone status and that CAPD patients have better bone mineral metabolism as shown mainly with the use of BMD measurements.","944":"The association between the use of erythropoietin and urea or creatinine clearance was studied in two populations on continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD) residing either at an altitude of 1600 m (n = 194) or at sea level (n = 108). Among peritoneal and total KT\/V urea and creatinine clearance (CCr) indices, only total CCr was lower in the high altitude group receiving erythropoietin than in the corresponding group not receiving erythropoietin (68.0 +\/- 34.9 vs 82.9 +\/- 40.9 L\/1.73 m2 weekly, p &lt; 0.01). However, 24-hour urine volume and urinary KT\/V urea and CCr were consistently lower in the groups receiving erythropoietin than in those not receiving erythropoietin. Total weekly KT\/V urea &lt; or = 1.70 and CCr &lt; or = 52 L\/1.73 m2 were considered indicators of inadequate CPD. Although the percent of patients receiving erythropoietin did not differ overall between groups with adequate and those with inadequate CPD, a trend towards more frequent use of erythropoietin was found in the sea level group with inadequate CCr versus the group with adequate CCr (28.2% vs 16.9%, p = 0.084). In CPD decreased renal function is associated with more frequent use of erythropoietin. Whether inadequate total urea or creatinine clearance is also associated with more frequent erythropoietin use requires further study.","945":"Possible relationships between the dialysate-to-plasma creatinine equilibration ratio (D\/Pcreatinine 4 hour), duration of peritoneal dialysis treatment, number of peritonitis episodes, and mass appearance rates of three connective tissue markers [carboxyterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP), aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP), and carboxyterminal telopeptide of type I collagen (ICTP)] were studied in 19 nondiabetic peritoneal dialysis patients. The absence of correlation between the mass appearance rates of the markers and the duration of dialysis treatment as well as the number of peritonitis episodes supports the concept that peritoneal dialysis does not cause persistent changes in the deposition and degradation rates of collagen. A correlation between the D\/Pcreatinine 4 hr and the PICP mass appearance rates was found. Since it is unlikely that transperitoneal transport alone is responsible for the appearance of PICP in dialysate, this might reflect an association between a large peritoneal surface area and the amount of submesothelial connective tissue.","946":"Heparin, routinely used in peritoneal dialysis, has been found to have various effects, mainly inhibitory. Its infusion into the peritoneal cavity may adversely affect mesothelial cell growth and regeneration. Thus we wished to determine if heparin inhibits mesothelial cell growth and is does-dependent. Rat mesothelial cells were incubated for 3 days and 6 days with 200, 100, 20, 2, and 0.5 U\/mL of heparin. Cellular proliferation and protein synthesis were determined by liquid scintillation counting after 24-hour pulses with 3H-thymidine and 3H-leucine. Heparin at 2 and 0.5 U\/mL had no significant effect on radionuclide uptake. At 100 U\/mL heparin inhibited radionuclide uptake by at least 50%. These findings indicate that heparin in small concentrations may be harmless, but at higher concentrations is inhibitory to mesothelial cell growth and proliferation.","947":"The relationship between insulin-like growth factor-I (IGF-I), body weight, and serum albumin was studied in 17 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and 17 patients on hemodialysis. Patients were matched for gender, age (33-83 years), body mass index (16.7-36.1 kg\/m2), hematocrit, concentrations of serum growth hormone, and duration of dialysis (1-210 months). Serum IGF-I concentration was measured by radioimmunoassay (Incstar) and albumin by a standard laboratory technique. CAPD patients had significantly lower serum albumin concentrations than hemodialysis patients, whereas IGF-I levels in the two groups were similar and did not differ from those in 18 normal subjects. We did not find significant positive correlations between IGF-I and serum albumin levels in CAPD or in hemodialysis patients. On the other hand, IGF-I showed a strong positive correlation with body weight (for the CAPD group r = 0.523; for both groups together r = 0.493). Both groups (CAPD and hemodialysis) and CAPD patients who weighted less than 60 kg (44%) had significantly lower serum IGF-I levels (113.5 +\/- 10.2 and 108.8 +\/- 15.7 micrograms\/l +\/- SEM, respectively) than patients who weighed 60-80 kg (38.3%; 181.2 +\/- 20.9 and 196.6 +\/- 27.2 micrograms\/L +\/- SEM, respectively) or above 80 kg (17.6%; 205.2 +\/- 37.7 and 229.5 +\/- 43.5; micrograms\/L +\/- SEM, respectively). It therefore appears that a low serum IGF-I level is a better indicator of malnutrition in CAPD and hemodialysis patients than low serum albumin.","948":"Abnormalities of energy metabolism may exacerbate the high prevalence of protein-calorie malnutrition and inadequate calorie intake in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, leading to further nutritional depletion. In a controlled study, using indirect calorimetry, we evaluated oxygen consumption (VO2), CO2 production, resting energy expenditure, and respiratory exchange ratio (RER) in 12 CAPD patients at rest and during a standard CAPD exchange and in 11 healthy nonuremic control patients. In addition, we investigated the influence of nutritional status and dialysis adequacy on energy metabolism in the CAPD group. There was no significant difference in resting energy parameters between the two groups. Unlike the control group, blood glucose and RER were maintained during prolonged fasting in the CAPD patients. This observation indicates that all the absorbed glucose was used as a metabolic fuel preventing fat oxidation. There was no significant relationship between energy expenditure and dialysis adequacy. There was no significant relationship between nutritional state (including energy intake) and energy expenditure despite evidence of malnutrition in 41% of the patients. If maintenance of \"normal levels\" of energy expenditure occurs in dialysis patients with suboptimal calorie intake (especially with evidence of protein-calorie malnutrition), this inability to conserve energy may act as an additional risk factor for ongoing malnutrition.","949":"We monitored thyroid function in 75 peritoneal dialysis patients (55 +\/- 15 years). A total of 20 (27%) were hypothyroid; 9 were diagnosed about the time of initiation of dialysis, and 11 prior to onset of renal failure. Thyroid function surveillance found an increase in serum thyrotropin (TSH) concentration to hypothyroid values in only one patient. On replacement therapy serum thyroxine was similar in euthyroid and hypothyroid patients (6.94 +\/- 1.69 vs 6.52 +\/- 1.65 micrograms\/dL, respectively; p = 0.380), but TSH was higher in hypothyroid patients (5.61 +\/- 5.67 vs 2.59 +\/- 1.49 microU\/mL, respectively; p = 0.001). Serum creatinine (8.6 +\/- 3.1 vs 11.4 +\/- 5.1 mg\/dL, respectively; p = 0.049) and albumin concentrations (3.76 +\/- 0.47 vs 3.33 +\/- 0.71 g\/dL, respectively; p = 0.006) were lower in hypothyroid than euthyroid patients. Hyperthyroid patients had higher serum triglyceride concentrations than euthyroid patients (306 +\/- 176 vs 189 +\/- 122 mg\/dL, respectively; p = 0.013). Parathyroid hormone (PTH) was lower in hypothyroid than normothyroid patients (108 +\/- 80 vs 261 +\/- 265 pg\/mL, respectively; p = 0.032). No differences were observed in serum calcium, phosphorus, and alkaline phosphatase. We conclude that hypothyroidism is common in peritoneal dialysis patients, usually antedates dialysis therapy, results in lower serum albumin and creatinine concentrations and higher serum triglyceride concentrations, is associated with lower serum PTH concentrations, and that thyroid function surveillance is not necessary in the absence of symptoms suggestive of hypothyroidism.","950":"Several hormonal alterations have been described in patients with chronic renal failure. However, there are few epidemiological studies on uremia-associated endocrine derangements, in particular in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis (PD). A cross-sectional descriptive study was performed to assess the prevalence of hormonal dysfunctions affecting pituitary secretions in the whole population of patients in the PD unit of our hospital. The total population included 69 patients, 66 on continuous ambulatory PD and 3 on continuous cycling PD. There were 31 men and 38 women, the mean age was 55 years (range 23-82 years), and the mean duration of PD was 32 months (range 1-161 months). There were 27 (39.1%) patients with diabetes mellitus (7 type I and 20 type II). Clinical records were reviewed for hormonal alterations affecting the pituitary and its target glands. The whole population had available data on the pituitary-thyroid axis. The following diagnoses and prevalences were found: hypothyrotropic hypothyroidism 4 (5.8%), subclinical hypothyroidism 4 (5.8%), primary hypothyroidism 8 (11.6%), and low T3 syndrome 11 (15.9%). The remaining pituitary hormones were available in 20 patients. Hyperprolactinemia was found in 7 (35%) patients and abnormally increased growth hormone levels in 6 (30%). Gonadotropin levels were normal for the age of the women and showed a tendency to be increased in most of the men. Corticotropin levels were normal in all patients with available data. There was no relationship between the high prevalence of diabetes mellitus in our population and the remaining hormonal derangements found. These results suggest that there is a non-negligible prevalence of pituitary abnormalities in uremic patients undergoing PD.","951":"We studied 212 patients from 13 Italian dialysis centers to evaluate the clinical aspects of dialysis-related amyloidosis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The mean age was 64.2 +\/- 12.3 years and mean time on dialysis was 36.9 +\/- 25.1 months. Residual diuresis was 615.7 +\/- 554.0 mL\/day and plasma beta 2-microglobulin (beta 2M) level was 27.0 +\/- 12.8 mg\/L. Radiological skeletal examination, neurological problems related to beta 2M, and urinary and dialytic balance of beta 2M were evaluated. Correlations between age, time on dialysis, residual diuresis, beta 2M plasma levels, beta 2M peritoneal and renal removal, carpal tunnel syndrome, and bone disease were studied. Only the number of bone lesions had a significant positive correlation with patient age and negative correlation with residual diuresis. The latter had an inverse relation with beta 2M plasma levels. Dialytic age did not correlate with any of the parameters. No other correlation was observed. Hand lesions were found in 85% of patients with bone dialysis-related amyloidosis. In conclusion, residual diuresis in our patients played a positive role in the number of bone localizations. Only age, but not time on dialysis, had a positive impact on the bone lesions. The high percentage of hand lesions suggests that the observation of this skeletal segment is a simple, safe, and effective modality of bone follow-up for dialysis-related amyloidosis.","952":"Fifteen continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients from our dialysis unit were studied while using two different types of exchange systems: a snap-disconnect Y-set system and the Baxter UltraBag system. The incidence of peritonitis in the snap-disconnect Y-system was found to be 32 cases in 187 months, or a rate of 1 case of peritonitis every 5.8 months. When these patients switched to the Baxter UltraBag system, the incidence of peritonitis dropped to 4 cases in 175 months, or 1 case every 43.8 months, a highly significant difference. We conclude, therefore, that the UltraBag system is highly effective in reducing the incidence of peritonitis in CAPD patients.","953":"From January 1989 to June 1994 we examined the success rate of fluoroscopically guided stiff wire manipulation of malfunctioning peritoneal dialysis catheters (PDCs) at St. Paul's Hospital, Saskatoon. There were 341 (201 male, 140 female) patients with a PDC. There were 118 manipulations (70 initial, 48 remanipulations) for malposition, fibrin clot, or kinked catheter. Single-cuff Tenckhoff catheters accounted for 95% of manipulated PDCs. No complications including peritonitis, exit-site infections, ruptured catheter, or bowel perforation were reported postmanipulation. A successful manipulation was defined as a functional PDC at 30 days postmanipulation. There was an overall success rate of 64%-67% for initial manipulations (IM) and 48% for remanipulations (RM). Ninety percent of those PDCs requiring IM occurred within 42 days of surgical insertion. RM occurred on average 55 days after IM. There were no risk factors identified that predisposed patients for PDC manipulation. This success rate for combined IM and RM of PDCs is higher than those rates quoted in the literature (27%-42%). We conclude that fluoroscopically guided stiff wire manipulation of PDCs, including repeated attempts, is a safe and effective way of prolonging PDC life, thus avoiding the risks of repeated surgery, improving quality of life, and decreasing health care costs.","954":"The authors report three cases of peritoneal dialysis catheter obstruction in children. The catheters were successfully cleared by a combination of urokinase and Fogarty catheter manipulation. This technique can be used to clear fibrin and omentum from obstructed peritoneal dialysis catheters.","955":"Catheter exit-site infection continues to be a more common morbid event in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis. Previous attempts to place a biointegration material at the next site have failed to reduce infection rates. This study reports the use of an innovative microporous silicone material placed as a cuff around the catheter at the exit site. The porous material has a pore-sized distribution that stimulates and facilitates capillary ingrowth into the pores. This capillary ingrowth prevents scar tissue formation, increases blood supply, and theoretically improves the immunological competence of the tissue at the vulnerable exit site. Twenty-five test catheters (12 using standard exit-site creation and 13 using the Moncrief-Popovich implantation technique) were implanted in a canine model. The exit-site infection rate in a canine model without the microporous material was 100% at 2 months. The corresponding results with the microporous material was 40% at 2 months. The majority of the test catheters showed progressive drying and healing at the exit site. Sixty percent of the catheters healed quickly and remained infection-free. Biointegration of the microporous material at the exit-site was demonstrated. Several exit site infections with the test catheters treated only with local therapy (without systemic or topical antibiotics) demonstrated progressive healing and secondary adequate biointegration. Because of these encouraging results, human studies were initiated, with the first human implant occurring in August, 1994. A 10-patient project is planned for the next year.","956":"The oligodynamic effect of silver has been utilized in medicine for many decades. This study evaluated the antimicrobial properties of two silver polymer surface treatments over 9 months to assess their usefulness for chronic percutaneous access. Silicone catheters were either dip-coated with micronized silver oxide in a silicone matrix (AgX) or impregnated with silver using an ion beam deposition process (Spire Argent I). Four-inch (10-cm) segments were shaken continuously in 10 mL minimum essential media (MEM) with 2% fetal bovine serum (FBS) at 25 degrees C. The medium was replaced weekly. Monthly eluate samples were assayed for Ag+ concentration using ICP atomic emission spectroscopy. Bimonthly, segments were removed, placed in fresh medium inoculate with 10(5) colony-forming units (cfu)\/mL Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 25923 and quantitated over 24 hours for bacterial survival\/growth. Relative to control catheters, there was a mean log10 reduction of S. aureus of 4.4 with AgX and 1.7 with Spire Argent I persisting over the 9-month study period. Silver ion elution followed a biphasic pattern with both coatings establishing a steady state of 0.2 ppm at 4 months. These data suggest that the test surface coatings employed will deliver long-term oligodynamic activity when implanted percutaneously.","957":"The migration of leukocytes, including polymorphonuclear neutrophils and monocytes, into the peritoneal cavity is a key event of intraperitoneal inflammation. We investigated the levels of two members of the chemokine family, interleukin 8 (IL-8) and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1 (MCP-1), in the dialysate effluent of 18 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients with peritonitis and compared them with chemokine levels in noninfected CAPD effluent. Being a major source of inflammatory cytokines, we also isolated peritoneal macrophages from peritonitis effluent to determine the mRNA expression directly after isolation. The mean (SEM) concentrations of IL-8 and MCP-1 were significantly higher in the effluent of peritonitis patients than in noninfected effluents MCP-1: 22.5 +\/- (6.27) versus 0.37 +\/- (0.1) ng\/mL and IL-8: 2.39 +\/- (1.15) versus 0.04 +\/- (0.01) ng\/mL. Northern blot analysis of isolated effluent macrophages revealed strong signals for MCP-1 and IL-8. Our findings showed that CAPD effluent from patients with peritonitis contains markedly elevated MCP-1 and IL-8 levels, suggesting that these chemokines participate in leukocyte recruitment during CAPD peritonitis. Isolation of mRNA of peritonitis-derived peritoneal macrophages revealed strong signals for MCP-1 and IL-8, suggesting that macrophages are a major source of these inflammatory mediators.","958":"Silver is known to have powerful antibacterial properties against a variety of micro-organisms and has a low toxicity and a favorable biocompatibility profile. This study was designed to evaluate the effectiveness of silver-coated catheters in preventing early exit-site infection and to assess tunnel morphology. Seven male Sprague-Dawley rats underwent simultaneous implantation of two double-cuffed, silver-coated silicone rubber and standard silicone rubber catheters. Weekly observations and photographs documented exit-site characteristics. The animals were sacrificed and catheters removed and processed for histopathology of the external tunnel at 5 weeks. Exit sites of silver-coated catheters tended to have less inflammation and infection and healed better than those of uncoated catheters; however, these data did not achieve significance using the Wilcoxon signed-rank test. Sections of the external tunnel of well-healing exit sites showed an epithelialized tract with granulation tissue near the cuff and significant invasion of the external cuff by collagen with a mild neutrophilic inflammatory response. In contrast, the histology of the external tunnel of infected exists revealed exudate overlying inflammatory granulation tissue and a variable degree of fibrosis of the cuff. When the exit sites appeared similar, no significant histopathological differences in sinus tract and cuff morphology were noted with either silver or standard catheters. In conclusion, these findings suggest that silver coating of catheters may decrease the incidence of early exit-site infections and allow better ingrowth of the catheter.","959":"For the initial treatment of peritonitis complicating peritoneal dialysis (PD), we use intraperitoneally administered gentamicin (broad spectrum and low costs) and rifampin (intracellular bactericidal activity). In order to assess the efficacy of this treatment, the outcome of 248 suspected episodes of peritonitis (abdominal pain, cloudy effluent, and a leukocyte count over 100\/mm3) was evaluated. Of 227 cases with a positive culture of the PD effluent, one bacterial species was cultured in 188 cases (75.8%), more than one in 32 cases (12.9%), and in 7 cases (2.8%) yeasts. In 87.2% of the culture-positive cases, a good clinical response to the initialized antibiotic therapy was found. In 20 cases (8.1%) antibiotic treatment was discontinued within one week because no micro-organisms were cultured. In one case no effluent was cultured. Although in vitro resistance or indifference to both antibiotics was found in 45 cases (19.8%), in only 29 culture-positive cases (12.8%) the clinical condition did not improve on initial therapy. Of the peritonitis episodes in which micro-organisms resistant to both antibiotics were cultured, 23 were Staphylococcus epidermidis, 5 were E. coli, 7 were yeasts, and there were miscellaneous (mostly enteral) bacteria in 10 cases. In the studied period no significant changes were found in the susceptibility of the cultured microorganisms to gentamicin and rifampin. Susceptibility profile per episode, however, showed an increasing resistance against both antibiotics. It is concluded that the combination of gentamicin and rifampin as initial treatment of peritonitis is effective in most (87%) cases.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","960":"There is an increasing trend towards the use of aminoglycosides in a once-daily dose administration for the treatment of severe infections in nonrenal failure patients. The use of once-daily dose aminoglycoside therapy may be associated with a reduction in toxicity. We performed a prospective randomized study comparing once-daily versus multiple-dose gentamicin in the treatment of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) peritonitis. Seventy-three patients with 100 new episodes of peritonitis were enrolled in the study. At presentation of peritonitis, the patients were alternately assigned to receive either intraperitoneal gentamicin at a dose of 40 mg\/2 L dialysate administered as a once-daily dose or gentamicin at a dose of 10mg\/2 L dialysate administered 4 times per day. All patients also received intraperitoneal vancomycin at a dose of 1 g per week. There were no significant differences in the treatment success (88% vs 82%, p = NS) and relapse (18% vs 20%, p = NS) rates between the once-daily dose and multiple-dose groups. The mean trough serum gentamicin level was higher in the once-daily dose group compared to the multiple-dose group (0.75 +\/- 0.72 vs 1.50 +\/- 1.40 mg\/L). In conclusion, gentamicin administered in a once-daily dose is as effective as multiple-dose administration in the treatment of CAPD peritonitis. The lower gentamicin level with once-daily dose administration may be associated with a reduction in aminoglycoside toxicity.","961":"Recurrent and resistant continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) peritonitis is usually treated by removal of the catheter and temporary hemodialysis. We treated 3 patients: 1 with resistant Klebsiella peritonitis and 2 with recurrent peritonitis (one due to Staphylococcus and the other to Enterococcus), by stopping CAPD for a 2-4 week period, leaving the catheter in situ and continuing antibiotic therapy. All 3 patients had resolution of their infections and restarted CAPD. This therapeutic modality reduced catheter replacements, limited admissions to the hospital, reduced psychological impact, and diminished risks and costs of CAPD.","962":"Two patients who developed fungal peritonitis after receiving continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for various periods were successfully treated with intracatheter retention of amphotericin B 1-2 mg and oral flucytosine or fluconazole 50 mg b.i.d. for 5 weeks. The catheter was not removed and efficient peritoneal permeability was maintained. We suggest that intracatheter retention of antifungal agents to sterilize the catheter with simultaneous oral antifungal agents be used to eradicate peritoneal infection. The catheter may not have to be removed, and CAPD can be accomplished. Period of hospitalization may be shortened, and the efficiency of CAPD can be maintained.","963":"Only 15 cases of any etiology of Neisseria meningitidis peritonitis have been reported in the world literature since the first case in 1917. We report the first case in a continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patient presenting with abdominal pain and cloudy peritoneal dialysis fluid. A lumbar puncture was normal. The patient died despite therapy with ceftriaxone. Autopsy confirmed this was a case of primary N. meningitidis peritonitis. Of the 15 cases of N. meningitidis reported as a cause of peritonitis, 9 patients were less than age 35 with no underlying diseases. Five cases were associated with cirrhosis or alcohol abuse. Two cases were associated with meningitis, and 1 patient was on steroid therapy for systemic lupus erythematosus. Nine of 15 patients recovered. In conclusion, N. meningitidis should be considered as another rare cause of peritonitis in patients on CAPD.","964":"Previous studies have shown the incidence of peritonitis to be generally lower for patients performing continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) than patients maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Recent changes in CAPD techniques, particularly the introduction of the UltraBag system, have resulted in a marked decrease in peritonitis rates in CAPD patients. The purpose of the present study was to compare peritoneal dialysis-related infections in 73 patients treated with CCPD and 57 patients treated with CAPD using the UltraBag system for a 12-month period. Demographic data of the two groups were comparable. Peritonitis rates were significantly lower in the patients treated with CAPD on the UltraBag (one infection\/23 patient-months) than in patients treated with CCPD (one infection\/14.4 patient-months, p &lt; 0.05). Exit-site infections were also significantly lower in patients treated with CAPD (one episode\/35 patient-months) compared to patients treated with CCPD (one episode\/11.5 patient-months, p &lt; 0.05). The spectrum of organisms causing infection was similar in both groups of patients. The study suggests that peritonitis and exit-site infections are significantly less common in patients treated with CAPD with the UltraBag system than in patients treated with CCPD.","965":"Peritonitis is a crucial complication of peritoneal dialysis. Over the last few years, new device systems have been developed to reduce episodes of peritonitis caused by exogenous contamination. Remarkable improvement has been obtained by modifying the original connection between the catheter and the bag with the introduction of the Y-set. The aims of this study were to test the reliability and simple use of a double-bag system without disinfectant in-line (Gemini, Gambro) and to evaluate the incidence of peritonitis in a 2-year period of follow-up. In a group of 167 patients, enrolled in 14 dialysis units in Italy, with a follow-up of 2433 patient-months, we observed 82 episodes of peritonitis in 52 patients, with a cumulative incidence of 1 episode every 29.7 patient-months. At 12 months the percentage of patients peritonitis-free was 69.7%, and at 24 months it was 62.8%. The training to complete the bag exchange, assessed by patient and nursing staff, was defined as \"easy\" in 61% of the cases and \"difficult\" in only 12% of the cases. The percentage of patients requiring a partner was 23%. For patients this device system presents easy handling in terms of the bag exchange, and it may prevent peritonitis.","966":"The purpose of this study was to analyze catheter outcome of persistent exit-site\/tunnel infections (ESI\/TIs) in peritoneal dialysis patients who underwent removal of the subcutaneous cuff due to persistent ESI\/TI from January 1989 to June 1994. One hundred and sixty-eight patients (98 male, 70 female) from our tertiary university hospital underwent 177 double-cuff coiled Swan neck catheter implantations surgically. Nineteen patients (11%) had persistent ESI\/TIs for more than 6 months. Thirteen persistent ESI\/TIs responded to subcutaneous cuff removal. One hundred and fifty-four episodes of ESI\/TI in 168 patients were observed over 3189 patient-months (0.58 episodes\/patient-year). Nineteen patients (11%) had persistent ESI\/TI with Staphylococcus aureus in 12 and Pseudomonas aeurginosa in 7 patients without episode of peritonitis except 2 patients with Staphylococcus aureus. Thirteen persistent ESI\/TI resolved after subcutaneous catheter removal without catheter loss, 8 with Staphylococcus aureus and 5 with Pseudomonas. Sixteen catheters were lost due to fungal peritonitis and two secondary to recurrent bacterial peritonitis. None of the catheters were removed as a result of ESI\/TI and related peritonitis. Subcutaneous cuff removal in persistent ESI\/TI in peritoneal dialysis patients can significantly reduce catheter loss related to ESI\/TI.","967":"The aim of this study was to show that ultraviolet (UV) irradiation to the skin around the catheter exit site (ES) could inhibit its infection. First, bacterial cultures of swabbed fluid from the ES were obtained from 68 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) outpatients six times during the 24-month observation period. Second, the bactericidal effects of UV irradiation on the catheter ES were examined. The results were as follows: (1) In spite of disinfection of the catheter ES by the strict application of povidone-iodine once or twice a day, 23%-45% of the cases were found to be micro-organism positive. The most prevalent micro-organisms from the catheter ES were, in order of highest to lowest prevalence, Staphylococcus epidermidis (SE), Staphylococcus aureus (SA), and Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA). (2) In the nasal cavity SA was detected in 20%-25% of patients. There was a high incidence of ES infection among the SA nasal carriers. (3) UV irradiation was performed in 18 cases that constantly revealed bacteria on culture at the catheter ES. Ten cases (55%) became culture-negative, 3 cases showed a microbial decrease, and 5 cases remained unchanged. These results suggest that UV irradiation can eliminate bacteria and can be of prophylactic use for ES infections.","968":"The authors tested in vitro the effect of glucose-based and amino acid-based dialysate effluent on the function of human peritoneal mesothelial cells. After 9 days of exposure to the tested effluents with medium (1:1 v\/v) or to a medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum (FCS) (control), several functional properties of the cells were studied. The synthesis of DNA measured by incorporation of 3H-methyl-thymidine was higher in mesothelial-cell monolayers exposed to the dialysates than in the controls. Synthesis of hyaluronic acid was similar in all three groups, but after stimulation with Il-1 the cells exposed to the dialysates produced more hyaluronic acid. Synthesis of tissue plasminogen activator (t-PA) and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) was higher in the control cells. However, after stimulation with IL-1, the cells exposed to the dialysate showed greater synthesis of PAI-1 than of t-PA. Also, procoagulant activity of the control cells was higher than that of the cells exposed to the dialysates. We have concluded that the functional properties of the mesothelial cells may be altered in vitro during prolonged exposure to the dialysate, something that may also occur in vivo.","969":"To analyze peritoneal catheter infections (PCIs), primarily the type (acute or chronic), frequency, and therapeutic outcome, we assessed 113 patients treated between January 1992 and December 1994. The average age was 56.3 +\/- 15.3 years, and 38% were diabetics. One hundred and thirty peritoneal catheters (PCs) were placed surgically in the lateral abdominal wall. The peritonitis rate fell from 0.61 episodes\/year to 0.33 episodes\/year, but the exit-site and\/or tunnel infection (ESI\/TI) rate increased (from 0.48 episodes\/year to 0.61 episodes\/year). Seventy-nine cases of PCI were observed; 58 (73.4%) were acute ESI\/TI and 21 (26.6%) were exacerbations of chronic ESI\/TI. Thirty-one (53.4%) acute PCIs were cured, 17 (29.3%) became persistent, and in 10 (17.2%) cases the PC was removed. In chronic ESI\/TI, of the 21 exacerbations registered, in 12 cases (57.1%) conservative treatment was effective, while in 9 cases (42.9%) the PC was removed. We conclude that ESI\/TIs are the most frequent type of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) infection and the more frequent cause of PC removal compared to peritonitis (p &lt; 0.001). PC removal is more frequent in chronic than in acute ESI\/TI (p &lt; 0.005). The progression of infection towards the external and even the internal cuff is a poor prognostic sign. Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa were the most common causes of infection and the most serious infective agents, causing chronic infection or catheter removal. Clinical evaluation of ESI\/TI can be helped significantly by ultrasound examination, which is 100% positive in chronic ESI\/TI and not more than 52.1% positive in acute ESI\/TI (p &lt; 0.005).","970":"Peritoneal dialysis patients may need solute permeability transport evaluation during acute peritonitis. The aim of this study was to assess if the simplified mass transfer coefficient (MTCS) or the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) was equivalent to the complex MTC (MTCX) in solute transport evaluation during acute peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. We studied 15 episodes of peritonitis (PTIS). Results were compared to a baseline patient study (PRE) and a control study done 30 days after diagnosis of peritonitis (POST). All peritoneal evaluation methods showed a significant increase in solute transport during acute peritonitis compared to baseline and control studies. There was an acceptable correlation between MTCX and simplified methods including the PET in the baseline and control studies. However, correlation between MTCX and simplified methods decreased during acute peritonitis. Likewise, the PET showed a better correlation with MTCX than MTCS. We conclude that the PET has an acceptable agreement with MTCX even during acute peritonitis, so the PET can be a useful tool in evaluating peritonitis-induced peritoneal permeability changes.","971":"To determine whether an early start of peritoneal dialysis is beneficial to the preservation of residual renal function, we studied the effect of peritoneal dialysis on the progression of glomerular sclerosis in subtotal nephrectomy rats. Four weeks after subtotal nephrectomy, Wistar rats were treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) (through a silicone catheter, two exchanges per day with 20 mL 1.5% dextrose solution per exchange for 8 weeks, n = 10). Then the kidneys were checked. The sclerosis index was significantly lower in the PD group than that of the control group, which was 1.12 +\/- 0.13, 1.64 +\/- 0.19, respectively (p &lt; 0.05). This suggests that peritoneal dialysis may suppress the progression of chronic renal failure. An early start of PD may benefit the preservation of renal function in uremic patients.","972":"We wished to assess the impact of automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) on the peritoneal dialysis (PD) program. From November 1981 to December 1993, 112 patients were started on hemodialysis (HD) as first treatment and 88 on PD [continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD): 78, APD: 10]; respective average ages were 61 +\/- 14 and 62 +\/- 13 years. To December 1985, APD was used as first treatment of PD in 1\/29 patients (3.4%), while subsequently, on the basis of a clinical and social-aptitude assessment protocol, it was used in 9\/59 patients (15.2%) with PD indication and CAPD contraindications (work: 2 patients, partner required: 7 patients). Of the patients who interrupted CAPD, APD was used in 9\/21 patients (reason: social aptitude, 28.6%; clinical, 71.4%). Technique survival after 5 years proved no different in HD versus PD (87% vs 82%, p = NS), whereas in HD versus CAPD it was different (87% vs 62%, p &lt; 0.025). The incidence of peritonitis in APD and CAPD with the Y-set was comparable (1\/37 vs 1\/40 episode\/patient-months), while germ distribution was different (p &lt; 0.001) with Staphylococcus epidermidis prevailing in APD (59%). Based on our experience, APD may extend method acceptance criteria and reduce the technique dropout rate in PD; however, connection technique may need to be improved in order to reduce the risk of peritonitis from exogenous contamination.","973":"Dyslipidemia is an important risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease. Serum lipoprotein (a) [Lp(a)] has been implicated as an independent atherogenic risk factor. We measured serum (Lp(a) levels in our patients and studied its correlations with other lipoproteins and clinical parameters. All stable patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for more than one month were enrolled in the study. Fasting serum Lp(a), total cholesterol, triglycerides, LDL-cholesterol, HDL-cholesterol, apolipoprotein-A and apolipoprotein-B levels were measured on entering the CAPD program and at 3 monthly intervals. One hundred and nine patients (M\/F: 65\/44, mean age +\/- SD: 59.5 +\/- 12.0 years) were studied. Fifty-two patients had diabetes mellitus. Age- and sex-matched normals were used as controls. Serum Lp(a) levels were raised in 54.5% of CAPD patients compared to 18.6% of controls (p &lt; 0.01). There was no significant change in Lp(a) levels over time. Serum Lp(a) levels showed positive and negative correlations with LDL-cholesterol and triglycerides, respectively, but not with age, sex, diabetic status, and serum total cholesterol and albumin levels. Thirty-six of 54 (66.7%) patients with serum Lp(a) levels greater than 30 mg\/dL had either coronary, cerebral, and\/or peripheral vascular disease compared to 30\/55 (54.5%) of patients with serum Lp(a) levels less than 30 mg\/dL (p = NS). In conclusion, serum Lp(a) levels were raised in a significant proportion of CAPD patients, but there was no significant association with vascular disease.","974":"The aim of this study was to measure the coagulation inhibitors in two groups of uremic patients treated with hemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) to evaluate the differences in anticoagulant activity. In 20 patients on HD and 20 on CAPD, mean age 66 +\/- 8 and 58 +\/- 14 years, respectively, the following parameters were determined between dialysis exchanges: protein C (PC), protein S (PS), antithrombin III (AT III), electrophoresis, prothrombin activation fragment (F1+2), alpha 1 antitripsin (alpha 1 AT), prothrombin time (PT), and activated partial thromboplastin time (PTT). The mean values of PC, PS, and AT III were respectively, 95.7 +\/- 16 on HD and 92 +\/- 23 on CAPD; 82.2 +\/- 13.6 on HD and 90.5 +\/- 13.6 on CAPD; the mean value F1+2 was 1.2 +\/- 0.5 on HD and 1.04 +\/- 0.5 on CAPD (p &lt; 0.05). A good correlation between PS and AT III% functional activity (p &lt; 0.03, r = 0.5) in both groups was found. More-over, PS functional activity was inversely correlated with duration of dialysis (p &lt; 0.05, r = -0.3). HD patients showed a reduction of coagulation inhibitors compared with CAPD patients. Such a phenomenon could justify the increased thrombotic risk in HD patients. Since 80% of those on HD and only 20% of those on CAPD received erythropoietin (EPO), the prothrombotic state in HD could be due to reduced PS activity secondary to EPO treatment.","975":"Sleep disturbances are common complaints of dialysis patients, and sleep studies have suggested that sleep apnea may occur frequently. We performed sleep studies on 18 stable continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Our results indicate that 6 of 18 patients (33%) had a respiratory disturbance index (RDI) greater than 15, which indicates severe sleep apnea. Twelve of 18 patients (67%) had an RDI greater than 5, indicating clinically significant sleep apnea. These results suggest that sleep apnea is common in CAPD patients. The impact of sleep apnea on the patients' quality of life remains to be determined.","976":"Because of its relatively small molecular size of 5800 daltons, insulin is a transperitoneally diffusable substance. Insulin is also known to be a mitogenic coadjuvant for mice fibroblasts, and safety of its long-term intraperitoneal use has been questioned because of the potential risk for peritoneal fibrosis. For similar reasons native insulin content of the peritoneal effluent should also not be neglected. To our knowledge, no sufficient data are available about native insulin transfer to dialysate during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). In this study we measured plasma and dialysate immune-reactive insulin levels during a 4 hour peritoneal exchange in 9 nondiabetic and 4 type II diabetic end-stage renal disease patients on CAPD. In both plasma and dialysate, insulin levels were higher in diabetic patients. At hour 4 of dwell time, plasma insulin was 37.5 +\/- 7.9 microU\/mL in non-diabetics and 64.2 +\/- 34.1 microU\/mL in type II diabetics. In both groups, dialysate insulin was 1.5 to 2 x higher than their simultaneous peripheral vein insulin levels and was measured as 88.1 +\/- 26.8 microU\/mL in nondiabetic group and 101.7 +\/- 52.6 microU\/mL in the diabetic group at hour 4 (p &lt; 0.005 vs 4 hour plasma level). In conclusion, in both diabetic and nondiabetic CAPD patients, native insulin was present in the dialysate in amounts exceeding simultaneous plasma levels. Equilibration with high portal vein insulin content through hepatic capsule may explain higher insulin concentrations measured in the dialysate.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","977":"The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) is a useful tool in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) prescription. PET D\/P ratios are reproducible in the same patient when performed within a short period. However, peritoneal transport consistency in nonselected patients over longer periods of time is debated. The PET was performed twice in 19 randomly selected patients (13 female) from a cohort of 55 patients on CAPD for 32 +\/- 24 months, age 44 +\/- 18 years. Mean time between the first and second PET was 9.6 +\/- 4 months. All patients were peritonitis-free at least 6 weeks before each PET. Fifteen patients did not change transport type between the two PETs: 3 low (L), 8 low-average (LA), 3 high-average (HA), and 1 high (H). Only 4 changed: 1 H to HA, 2 LA to HA, and 1 L to LA. In these 4 patients the change was centripetal (towards the mean) and less than 1 SD and not considered clinically significant. No differences between both groups in peritonitis rate, gender, age, time on dialysis, and diabetes mellitus status were observed. Transport type, as evaluated by the PET, was consistent over time in our group of patients.","978":"Treatment of high-membrane transporters with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is associated with ineffective ultrafiltration, increased dialysate protein loss, lower serum albumin levels, and lower protein catabolic rates, suggesting development of inadequate dialysis. The use of short-dwell nightly intermittent peritoneal dialysis (NIPD) and daytime ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (DAPD) has not been evaluated. Patients with inadequate ultrafiltration secondary to rapid membrane transport [peritoneal equilibration test (PET) confirmation] were managed with NIPD and DAPD (group A, n = 32) and compared to patients on CAPD and continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) (group B, n = 53) after at least 3 months of therapy. Groups A and B were similar in age, gender, diabetic status, prestudy months on peritoneal dialysis (PD), and residual renal function. No significant differences were observed between the groups with respect to serum albumin, daily protein loss, normalized protein catabolic rate (PCRN), or weekly KT\/V urea indices. Diabetics demonstrated lower levels of serum albumin and PCRN than nondiabetics while maintaining equivalent KT\/V urea indices. Reassessment of patients 6 months later also revealed no differences in outcome measures between group A (n = 20) and group B (n = 36). High transporters treated with NIPD and DAPD appear to have similar dialysate protein loss, adequacy, and nutrition indices when compared to patients on CAPD and CCPD. Future studies will determine if delivery of higher target small-solute clearances benefits patients on NIPD\/DAPD as contrasted with continuous PD modalities (CAPD\/CCPD), or diabetics compared to nondiabetics.","979":"Peritoneal macrophages are the predominant cells in peritoneal dialysate. To clarify the role of the macrophage in fibrosis of the peritoneum in long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, we studied the transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta 1) mRNA expression by peritoneal macrophages from peritoneal dialysis patients. Macrophages were obtained when the catheter was inserted and one month later. TGF-beta 1 mRNA was measured by slot-blot hybridization using a cDNA probe. The result was that TGF-beta 1 expression was significantly higher in macrophages from peritoneal dialysate than that of macrophages obtained during catheter insertion. This suggests that peritoneal macrophages play a role in the pathogenesis of fibrosis of peritoneum in peritoneal dialysis patients. It also suggests that peritoneal macrophages in dialysate have been somewhat activated.","980":"In continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) residual renal function (RRF) plays an important role in the total amount of weekly clearances of small molecules. The purpose of this study was to determine if there were any differences in certain nutritional parameters between patients with and without RRF, total weekly clearance (KT\/V) being equal. Therefore, we compared two groups of patients with equal weekly KT\/V: group A without RRF [n = 7, KT\/V 2.07 +\/- 0.2) and group B with RRF (n = 7, KT\/V 2.11 +\/- 0.1, urea clearance 1.13 +\/- 0.8, creatinine clearance 2.01 +\/- 1.5 mL\/min, contributing on the average of 15% (range 5.5%-28%) to the determination of KT\/V]. The two groups were selected from 52 patients on CAPD for more than 9 months and they were comparable in age (A = 64.6 +\/- 7 years, B = 64.1 +\/- 7 years), duration of dialysis (A = 39.8 +\/- 25 months, B = 36.3 +\/- 31 months), body weight (A = 64 +\/- 3.9 kg, B = 64.7 +\/- 7.4 kg), and body mass index (A = 26.6 +\/- 2.9, B = 25.8 +\/- 3.6). The two groups turned out to be different in transferrin (A = 209 +\/- 51, B = 278 +\/- 24 mg\/dL, p &lt; 0.006), normalized protein catabolic rate (PCRN) (A = 0.87 +\/- 0.07, B = 1.11 +\/- 0.07 g\/kg\/day, p = 0.00), and albumin (A = 3.31 +\/- 0.1, B = 3.55 +\/- 0.2, p &lt; 0.02).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","981":"The use of creatinine clearance for adequacy of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) requires consideration of the fact that a significant fraction of residual renal creatinine clearance is contributed by tubular secretion. We analyzed 123 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients and corrected the residual renal creatinine clearance by averaging renal creatinine and urea clearance to estimate the glomerular filtration rate (GFR). Modified total creatinine clearance (peritoneal plus estimated renal GFR) was compared with total creatinine clearance (peritoneal plus total renal creatinine clearance). Modified and total creatinine clearances were not significantly different in patients with a total creatinine clearance less than 60 L\/week\/1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA), but a significantly lower modified total creatinine clearance was seen with patients having greater than 60 L\/week\/1.73 m2 BSA of total creatinine clearance. The correlation was better between KT\/V and modified total creatinine clearance (r = 0.74) as compared to KT\/V and total creatinine clearance (r = 0.67). We suggest that if creatinine clearance is used for peritoneal dialysis (PD) adequacy, the contribution of residual renal function should be calculated as the average of renal creatinine and urea clearance, thus estimating creatinine clearance only by the GFR. Further long-term studies are needed to confirm that modification of total creatinine clearance will better predict clinical outcome.","982":"","983":"The urinary creatinine excretion rate is a function of the muscle mass which, in normal subjects, is shown to be correlated with lean body mass. Dual Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) has been shown to correlate well with other methods for the measurement of body composition. The purpose of the present study was to compare estimates of lean body mass (LBM) by DEXA scan with urine and dialysate creatinine recovery in uremic patients and in normal subjects. We included 63 normal subjects with a creatinine clearance of 60-120 mL\/min, 30 uremic predialysis patients with creatinine clearance below 30 mL\/min, and 20 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. LBM was measured by DEXA scan on the same day as urine collection and was estimated from creatinine recovery with and without correction for extrarenal creatinine clearance. Results from the normal subjects showed no difference in estimates of LBM by the different methods but, in predialysis and CAPD patients, a significant difference between methods of estimating LBM was found, even when correction for extrarenal clearance in uremic patients was performed. In normal subjects: DEXA 43.6 kg versus creatinine excretion 43.2 kg (NS). In predialysis patients: DEXA 47.8 kg versus 37.6 kg (p &lt; 0.001) corrected 44.8 kg (p &lt; 0.05). In CAPD patients: DEXA 47.2 kg versus 32 kg (p &lt; 0.001) corrected 42.6 kg (p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, the urine and dialysate creatinine excretion is an inaccurate estimate of LBM, but reflects the muscle mass and, in that respect, is an important tool in the nutritional evaluation of uremic patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","984":"Hypoalbuminemia in hemodialysis patients is a strong predictor of mortality; however, the significance of hypoalbuminemia in peritoneal dialysis patients is less well-defined. We have analyzed the factors associated with hypoalbuminemia in a cross-sectional study of 36 peritoneal dialysis patients, and investigated the impact of hypoalbuminemia on the one-year clinical outcome in 53 peritoneal dialysis patients. We found hypoalbuminemia to be associated with low values for the kinetic parameters KT\/V, creatinine clearance, and normalized protein catabolic rate (nPCR) by univariant analysis. In a multiple regression model, nPCR was the only significant predictor of serum albumin. Clinical outcome measures evaluated were days-hospitalized, peritonitis rate, and death. Days-hospitalized was inversely correlated with serum albumin, and deaths occurred only in patients with serum albumin less than 4.0 mg\/dL. There were no associations with peritonitis episodes. In conclusion, our study provides evidence that hypoalbuminemia in peritoneal dialysis patients is associated with a low protein intake measured by the nPCR and, possibly, with a low delivered dose of dialysis. Our study also suggests that the serum albumin level correlates to clinical outcome measured by days-hospitalized.","985":"There has been a gradual increase in the number of diabetic and elderly patients maintained on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) replacement therapy. Eighty randomly selected patients were studied over two years. Weekly normalized urea clearance (KT\/Vurea), weekly creatinine clearance\/1.73 m2 body surface area (BSA) (Ccr), and protein catabolic rate (PCR) were measured. Selected clinical outcome criteria were assessed. Weekly KT\/Vurea was correlated with weekly Ccr (r = 0.538, p &lt; 0.001), and weekly KT\/Vurea was correlated with PCR (r = 0.393, p &lt; 0.001). Patients were then stratified according to presence or absence of diabetes mellitus and age &gt; 60 or &lt; or = 60 years. Diabetic and nondiabetic patients had similar weekly KT\/Vurea, weekly Ccr, PCR, serum albumin levels, weekly erythropoietin (EPO) requirements, peritonitis rates, and CAPD-related hospitalization rates. The total hospitalization rates, however, were higher in diabetic patients. Elderly and younger patients had similar weekly KT\/Vurea, weekly Ccr, PCR, serum albumin levels, and weekly EPO requirements. Elderly patients, however, had higher peritonitis rates and higher total and CAPD-related hospitalization rates.","986":"The study was designed to investigate the incidence of abdominal wall hernias (AWH) and related outcome in all end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients who started peritoneal dialysis (PD) from January 1989 to December 1993. Between January 1989 and December 1993, a total of 158 ESRD patients (93 male, 65 female) entered our home program and were treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) over 2789 patient-months. All PD catheters were placed in the lateral by two dedicated surgeons. AWH detected at the time of PD catheter placement was repaired simultaneously. The hernia repair was done using a polypropylene mesh. Inguinal hernias were noted by patients as a mass or discomfort. Umbilical and incisional hernias were observed during clinic visits. Twenty-one (13.3%) abdominal wall hernias were observed in 20 patients (12.7%). Eight (38.1%) inguinal hernias occurred in 8 male patients. Six inguinal hernias were repaired. PD was resumed after a mean of 12 days of hernia repair. Two patients resumed PD in 8 and 14 days without dialysis. One patient transferred to hemodialysis (HD) due to catheter malfunction. No complications occurred related to inguinal hernias. Ten (47.6%) umbilical hernias were observed in 10 patients (7 male, 3 female). The strangulation of umbilical hernias occurred in 2 patients, which required emergency small bowel resection and hernia repair. Both cases were complicated by candida peritonitis and enterobacter peritonitis, requiring PD catheter removal, and patients were then transferred to HD. Three (14.3%) incisional hernias were observed in 3 male patients. Two incisional hernias were repaired. No relation between AWH and PD modalities (CAPD\/CCPD\/IPD) was observed.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","987":"We report a case of polycystic kidney disease, successfully dialyzed using nocturnal intermittent peritoneal dialysis (NIPD) for ten years. Other forms of renal replacement therapy, which included hemodialysis, continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD), and renal transplantation, were unsuitable for the patient. A peritoneal equilibration test revealed a 4-h D\/P creatinine (Cr) ratio of 0.54. In January 1984, the patient began NIPD for 12 h, using a dialysis solution dose of 14 L\/day, and 2 L\/exchange. In January 1986, because of clinical under-dialysis, the dialysis solution dose was increased to 20 L\/day, with an exchange volume of 1.57 L. The prescribed outflow time was 20 min. Dialysis was still inadequate with a weekly corrected Cr clearance (CoCrCl\/w) of 33.6 L. In August 1986, the outflow time was reduced to 14 min and the total dialysis time to 11 h. Despite the latter, the efficiency of dialysis was greater because of longer full contact between dialysate and peritoneum. The last change resulted in marked clinical improvement and CoCrCl\/w increased to 39.9 L. Over the years, the patient's peritoneal transport changed to high average (4-h D\/P Cr = 0.74) and NIPD provided even better clearances (CoCrCl\/w = 59.96 L in 1994). The report emphasizes that NIPD, if properly tailored, can provide clinically adequate long-term dialysis.","988":"to evaluate vascular disease and its outcome in association with thrombocytosis in chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. the study was designed to investigate possible correlations between severity of vascular disease and thrombocytosis in PD patients. tertiary-referral university hospital. serial blood platelet levels were measured in 53 stable PD patients (32 male, 21 female; mean age 55 years; mean duration of PD 19 months) between January 1991 and July 1992. Twenty-four patients were diabetic and 29 were nondiabetic. Mean duration of PD was 23 and 36 months in diabetic and nondiabetic patients, respectively. Severity of coronary arterial disease (CAD), carotid arterial disease (CNS), and peripheral arterial disease (PAD) was assessed using the Craven et al. (1991) ESRD Severity Index, a measure of organ dysfunction. Functional status was assessed using the Karnofsky Performance Status Index (KPSI). eighteen out of 53 PD patients (34%) had platelet counts exceeding 300,000\/mm3 for six months or longer. Thirteen of 24 diabetic PD patients (54%) had thrombocytosis. Blood platelets were significantly (p &lt; 0.01) higher in diabetic (324,000 +\/- 27,000\/mm3) than in nondiabetic PD (236,000 +\/- 11,000\/mm3) patients. In the PD group as a whole, a positive correlation was observed between blood platelet and serum cholesterol (r = 0.5, p &lt; 0.001), blood platelet and PAD (r = 0.5, p &lt; 0.001), and blood platelet and CAD (r = 0.35, p &lt; 0.05). No correlation was found with age or duration of PD. In diabetic PD patients, blood platelet counts correlated significantly with PAD (r = +0.5, p &lt; 0.01) and CAD (r = +0.4, p &lt; 0.05) indexes. No correlation was observed between blood platelet and CNS or KPS indexes. In nondiabetics, no correlation was observed between blood platelet and CAD, PAD, CNS, or KPS indexes. CAD, PAD, and KPS indexes were significantly higher in diabetics compared to nondiabetics. thrombocytosis, particularly in diabetic PD patients, appears to be associated with the severity of PAD and CAD. ","989":"The treatment of cirrhotic patients with ascites and end-stage renal disease (ESRD) is complex. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), as a continuous therapy, represents an alternative to hemodialysis-associated hemodynamic intolerance. We report our experience with 5 cirrhotic patients with ascites who were treated by CAPD. Three had been transferred from hemodialysis (HD) for intolerance. The hemodynamic tolerance was excellent in all patients, and solute and water peritoneal transport were increased over the normal range in all cases. Morbidity was principally related to liver disease. Peritoneal protein losses, initially high, decreased over time. Serum albumin was within the low normal range. The incidence of peritonitis was higher than usual in these patients; episodes caused by gram-negative bacteria, streptococci and listeria, were predominant. The cause of death was not CAPD-related. In our experience, CAPD should be the treatment of choice for cirrhotic patients with ascites who require dialysis.","990":"Over a 14 year period, 56 of 415 CAPD patients (34 male, 22 female), aged 42.7 +\/- 11 years, underwent renal transplantation (TR). A cadaver kidney was used in 53 patients (kidney-pancreas in 2), and a human leucocyte antibody (HLA) identical related donor organ was used in 3. Underlying renal diseases were chronic glomerulonephritis in 30 patients, diabetic nephropathy in 10, interstitial nephropathy in 5, vascular in 4, polycystic kidney in 3, and undetermined in 4. Mean duration of CAPD prior to TR was 13 months (2-56 months). A three-week peritonitis episode-free interval was requested prior to TR. At year 1, actuarial patient and graft survival (96% and 86%, respectively), plasma creatinine, and number of rejection episodes were not different from those recorded in patients treated with hemodialysis (HD) prior to TR. At TR, pulmonary artery pressure (PAP) was elevated (average 21.1 +\/- 7.4 mm Hg), &gt; or = 25 mm Hg and &gt; or = 30 mm Hg in 36% and 14.6% of CAPD patients, respectively. Post-TR, HD was performed in 4 patients; no peritoneal infection occurred. Postoperative sonography disclosed ascitis in 12.7% of CAPD patients. The PD catheter was removed two months post-TR. Hemodynamic findings at TR suggest a frequently underestimated overhydration in CAPD patients, which should be detected and treated in order to reduce acute cardiovascular complications at TR.","991":"In automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) patients treated with 3-L dwell, intraperitoneal volumes can easily be increased up to 4 or 4.5 L using hypertonic solutions without objective control of their good tolerance. In 20 adult patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in good conditions, hydrostatic intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) and pulmonary vital capacity (VC) were measured in strict supine position, after infusing isotonic dialysate in 0.5-L increments from 2 up to 5 L as tolerated, according to intraperitoneal volumes (IPV). None of the patients had cardiac or pulmonary dysfunction. IPP was measured following a routine method previously described. In all cases, experience was stopped when IPP increased over 20 cm H2O and\/or VC decreased over 25%. IPV is linearly and positively correlated with IPP (p &lt; 0.0001), and negatively with VC (p = 0.0012), but the reliability of VC is less than that of IPP, particularly in old patients. Clinical symptomatology of bad IPV tolerance never occurred alone and was always associated with an increase in IPP over 20 cmH2O and\/or a decrease in VC over 25%. The maximal acceptable IPV is better defined by an IPP less than 18 cmH2O, according with a decrease in VC of less than 20%. Routine measurement of IPP can be used to determine maximal IPV and for optimal PD prescription.","992":"We present the nurse's procedure for routine measurement of intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure (IPP). It is very easy, simple, and safe. We measure the height of dialysis fluid in the peritoneal dialysis (PD) line before drainage. The level of the column of dialysate is measured with a scale, expressed in centimeters of water. The patient rests in a strictly horizontal position and the zero level is set at the medial axillary line. Two measurements are taken: one when breathing in and the other when breathing out. The IPP must be measured at atmospheric pressure without any counterpressure. Therefore, two techniques exist, depending on the geometry of the PD system. With disconnect systems, there is no counterpressure in the line and the empty drainage bag. With nondisconnect systems, there is always a counterpressure in the line because an air inlet is necessary. The measurement of IPP is an important element in the medical prescription of intraperitoneal volumes for adequate dialysis and to prevent mechanical complications. Normal values are established in patients undergoing CAPD treatment: IPP insp. = 14 +\/- 2 cmH2O and IPP exp. = 12 +\/- 2 cmH2O.","993":"To determine how well hypertension is controlled in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, we monitored the blood pressure of 31 hypertensive adult CAPD patients treated with antihypertensive agents. Blood pressure (BP) monitoring, using a noninvasive, ambulatory BP monitor, began in the morning and continued every 30-60 min for 24 h (mean 42 readings per patient). The mean BP of all patients over 24 h was 145.6\/91.3 mm Hg. In these, 40.5% of systolic BP readings exceeded 150 mm Hg and 50.2% of diastolic readings exceeded 90 mm Hg, suggesting that hypertension was inadequately controlled for a considerable period of time. Diabetic patients had even worse control of BP. Mean BP, heart rates, and BP loads were not different, between daytime or nighttime. These findings suggest that CAPD patients do not preserve the normal circadian rhythm of BP and that their hypertension is not controlled any better during the night than during the day. We repeated BP monitoring after adjustment of antihypertensive medications in 8 patients who had poorly controlled hypertension. Systolic and diastolic BP loads in subsequent studies improved significantly from the first study. hypertension is suboptimally controlled in most CAPD patients; diabetic patients fare even worse in the control of hypertension; most patients do not preserve the circadian rhythm of BP and there is no difference in the adequacy of hypertension control during the day or at night; assessment of hypertension with ambulatory BP monitoring helps guide therapy and control of hypertension. ","994":"The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) is used as a tool for dialysis prescription. In order to establish which parameters can predict peritoneal transport type, we studied 55 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), who were subjected to a standard PET. Clinical data (sex, age, calculated body surface area [BS], average time on dialysis [TD], and presence of diabetes mellitus), laboratory variables, (serum creatinine [SCr] blood urea nitrogen [BUN], serum albumin [SA], and residual renal function), and adequacy parameters (dialysate creatinine clearance [CrCl], weekly clearance of urea normalized to total body water [KT\/V], protein catabolic rate, and dialysis index), were obtained and recorded at the time of the PET. The study group was composed of 29 males and 26 females, mean age of 43.5 +\/- 16 years, and average TD of 25.2 +\/- 18 months. PET results: 13 patients were low, 16 low average, 19 high average, and 7 high peritoneal transporters. According to the logistic regression analysis, the factors significantly associated with the type of peritoneal transport were: BS, SA, dialysate CrCl, and TD (coefficients 7.2, -1.23, 0.72, and -0.03, respectively). Greater BS and lower SA directly correlate with high peritoneal transport, and are the strongest predictors for the model.","995":"Acetazolamide is a carbonic anhydrase inhibitor commonly used to reduce intraocular pressure (IOP). We report the first pharmacokinetic study of acetazolamide in a patient undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The patient was a Type I diabetic with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) undergoing CAPD who received acetazolamide for elevated IOP after surgery for a detached retina. Serum acetazolamide concentrations were measured prior to a 250 mg oral dose and 12 additional times during a 24-h dosing interval. All dialysate effluent was collected and assayed for acetazolamide. Serum concentrations at the beginning and end of the dosing interval were 18 and 17 mcg\/mL, respectively, with a maximum concentration of 27 mcg\/mL at 6.5 h (therapeutic range = 5-10 mcg\/mL). The elimination half-life was prolonged, 28.5 h, compared to that seen in subjects with normal renal function (5-10 h). CAPD did not remove a clinically significant amount of drug (17.1 mg, or 6.8% of dose recovered in dialysate). The patient was very lethargic during therapy, a possible manifestation of acetazolamide toxicity. Marked reduction in acetazolamide dosage (in this case, 125 mg\/day) would be required to prevent drug accumulation and toxicity.","996":"The purpose of this study was to determine absorption rate and toxicity of intraperitoneal iron in rats. Twelve (12) male S-D rats were divided into two groups. Group 1 was given 1.5% Dianeal containing 4 mg\/L of iron as ferric chloride and group 2 was given standard 1.5% Dianeal. Preblood samples were obtained at the start of the experiment, and 25 mL of the designated dialysis solution was injected into the peritoneal cavity. Six hours after injecting the solution, the dialysate was drained and post-blood samples were obtained. A specimen for histological examination was taken from each rat at the end of the experiment. The iron concentrations of preserum, postserum, dialysis solution with and without added iron, and drained dialysate, were determined. No remarkable changes of serum iron concentration were observed with the six-hour cycle time. Sixty percent of the injected iron was absorbed. No acute toxicity to the peritoneum was observed.","997":"Since the introduction of the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) by Twardowski in 1987, it became a widely accepted test that provided useful prognostic information on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). It had been shown to be a readily reproducible test if the standard procedure was followed. Although there was wide interpersonal difference in the test results, the mean and range (and standard deviation, SD) were remarkably similar as suggested by Davies et al. in 1993 (3). We had performed PET on our CAPD patients for a few years, and all along we used the reference range established by Twardowski to classify our patients into High, High average, Low average, and Low transporters because no reference range had ever been established in Chinese. The aim of this study was to define the normal mean and range of the PET results in Chinese CAPD patients. We analyzed 100 PET results from 100 Chinese CAPD patients. The mean +\/- (SD) of the ratio of dialysate\/plasma of creatinine and glucose at four-hour dwell times were 0.71 (0.15) and 0.37 (0.12), respectively. There was a significant difference in the dialysate\/plasma ratio of creatinine (p &lt; 0.01) while that of glucose was similar when compared with those found by Twardowski. There was no difference in the solute transfer in diabetic and nondiabetic patients. We concluded that the creatinine clearance of the peritoneal membrane in Chinese CAPD patients was higher than the previously reported result in North American patients.","998":"The aim of the study was to investigate the reproducibility of the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) for evaluating changes in peritoneal function in a rat model of peritoneal dialysis. A PET with 4.25% Dianeal was performed twice within 48 hours under similar conditions after a catheter insertion (n = 10). No significant differences were found between the D\/P ratios of PET 1 and PET 2 for urea nitrogen, creatinine, total protein, and D\/D0 ratio for glucose. The results for PET 1 and PET 2 showed highly significant correlations. This study indicates, when carried out under similar conditions, that the PET is a highly reproducible test and can be used to evaluate the function of the peritoneum during peritoneal dialysis in rats.","999":"Fourteen patients on hemodialysis (HD) and 17 patients on continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD) were treated with 28-30 IU\/m2\/week of recombinant human growth hormone (rhGH) for at least 12 months. The HD and CPD patient groups were comparable with regard to age, bone age, height standard deviation scores (SDS), and height velocity at start of treatment. During the first year of rhGH treatment, height velocity increased from 2.9 +\/- 1.9 to 5.5 +\/- 1.7 cm\/year in the HD group and from 3.0 +\/- 2.2 to 7.2 +\/- 3.2 cm\/year in the CPD group. The increase in growth rate was significant in both groups (p &lt; 0.001), and tended to be significantly greater in the CPD than in the HD group (p = 0.09). The marked acceleration of growth under rhGH treatment resulted in an increase in relative height by 0.37 +\/- 0.38 SDS in the HD group and by 0.47 +\/- 0.69 SDS in the CPD group during the first treatment year. Seven HD and 7 CPD patients completed a second year of rhGH treatment. In these patients, height velocity dropped to 3.6 +\/- 2.7 cm\/year (HD) and 3.6 +\/- 2.3 cm\/year (CPD), respectively during the second treatment year. We conclude that rhGH treatment accelerates growth in children both on HD and CPD. The treatment response tends to be greater in CPD compared to HD patients. The efficacy of treatment decreases considerably during the second treatment year.","1000":"Ten continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients experienced 23 episodes of peritonitis and were treated with intraperitoneal (IP) antibiotics as per sensitivity report. Serum ferritin was measured before and after the treatment. In 6 patients, erythropoietin (EPO) was also measured before and after the treatment. There was a significant drop in the serum EPO levels after therapy compared to the levels before, whereas serum ferritin levels did not change.","1001":"The Italian Registry of Pediatric Chronic Peritoneal Dialysis (CPD) carried out a special study on patient hospitalization during the years 1989-1992. Ninety-two children (mean age 8.4 +\/- 4.7 years) entered the study, for a total of 1406 CPD-months. The contribution of the different causes of hospitalization for a total of 4683 hospital days was: CPD training 31%; routine controls 14%; CPD-related complications 35%; clinical complications 14%; other causes 6%. The rate of patient hospitalization that resulted was 3.33 days\/CPD-month; it was higher in the first year (4.32 days\/CPD-month) than in the second year (1.64 days\/CPD-month) or in the third year (2.25 days\/CPD-month). This difference was mainly due to the need for the training at the start of the CPD treatment. The evaluation of the hospitalization rate in different age groups showed a statistically significant difference (p &lt; 0.05) between the group 0-2 years (5.47 days\/CPD-month) and the group 3-15 years (2.78 days\/CPD-month). Complications were the cause of 150 admissions to the hospital (1:9.6 CPD-months). Ninety-eight admissions were due to CPD-related complications: peritonitis (33%), problems with the catheter (19%), abdominal hernias (4%), and others (9%). Among clinical complications (52 admissions), the main cause of hospitalization was hypertension (15%), followed by infections (4%), and malnutrition (3%).","1002":"Being more suitable to children's lifestyle habits, continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) is becoming the treatment modality of first choice in the pediatric CPD population. In order to establish whether these regimens, prescribed on an empirical basis, provide an equally effective dialysis as does standard continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), we performed a cross-sectional analysis of dialysate and residual renal small molecule clearances in 85 children aged 3 months to 20 years, who were treated in 16 pediatric dialysis centers. Forty-three children were on CAPD and 42 were on CCPD. The two patient groups did not differ in age, body size, duration of dialysis, underlying disease distribution, or residual renal function. The CAPD patients achieved an average daily drain volume of 159 +\/- 40 mL\/kg body weight, as compared to 208 +\/- 95 mL\/kg in the CCPD group (p &lt; 0.005). Average serum creatinine and BUN values were similar in both groups. While the (total) creatinine clearance did not differ, the KT\/V urea was significantly higher in the patients treated with CCPD (0.35 +\/- 0.12 vs 0.28 +\/- 0.13, p &lt; 0.05). The estimated protein catabolic rate (PCR) was significantly higher in the CCPD group (1.39 +\/- 0.6 g\/kg d) than in the CAPD patients (1.08 +\/- 0.48 g\/kg d, p &lt; 0.05). Three-day dietary histories, available in 20 patients, showed a similar difference in dietary protein intake between CCPD and CAPD patients. We conclude that CCPD treatment regimens, at the dose currently prescribed in Mid-European pediatric dialysis centers, provide a higher clearance of urea and, possibly, other small molecules.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1003":"Continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) is automatically performed by a cycler as a repetition several times per session of the same programmed exchange. We have investigated the efficiency, in terms of ultrafiltration (UF) capacity and solute clearance (phosphate), of an adapted (optimized) CCPD versus a conventional CCPD. Adapted CCPD was performed manually in order to allow a combination of short dwell times (optimal ultrafiltration) and long dwell times (optimal purification). The ratio of ultrafiltration over glucose absorbed (UF\/G) was higher with adapted CCPD (5.7 +\/- 0.8) compared with conventional CCPD (4.8 +\/- 1.3). Phosphate purification was also enhanced with adapted CCPD (0.21 +\/- 0.05 versus 0.16 +\/- 0.05 mL\/min\/kg). These results confirm the usefulness of the concept of adapted CCPD with variable dwell times for optimization of peritoneal dialysis performances in children.","1004":"To evaluate the role of trained home nurses in the care of end-stage renal disease (ESRD) pediatric patients on continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) and\/or for family relief. The study was designed to investigate trained home nurses in the care of pediatric ESRD patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) who entered the home program between February 1991 and October 1993. Tertiary-referral university hospital. We trained the nursing staff of nursing agencies to perform PD with a special emphasis on pediatric care. A weekly nursing summary including daily vital signs, PD flow sheet, medications, and progress notes was sent to the home program. The trained nurses were also utilized for family relief to prevent burn-out. Five children (4 female, 1 male) with ages ranging from 3-14 years were studied. The total number of patient-months was 81 with a range of 4-33 patient-months. During this time, there was only one hospital admission for hyperkalemia and hypertension. Five episodes of peritonitis occurred over 81 patient-months, and all were treated at home. The clinic visit compliance was 100% in patients having nursing help. The administration of erythropoietin at home in these patients was consistent, resulting in higher hematocrit (Hct) levels. The added support to patients and family resulted in a low incidence of complications and infrequent need for hospital admissions. Our experience suggests that the use of private duty nurses for performing CCPD or for family relief in ESRD children has a favorable outcome and would benefit most pediatric home dialysis programs. ","1005":"The hospital records of all patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) who were followed from January 1992 to June 1993 in a third level pediatric hospital were retrospectively reviewed to compare the peritonitis rates of groups of patients according to the dialysis system employed. All patients had Tenckhoff catheters installed by open technique. The groups were A) traditional spike connection system (37 patients), and B) disconnect systems (16 patients) that comprised the O-set system (10 patients) and the basic Y-set system (6 patients). Age was 11.9 +\/- 3.7 years (mean +\/- SD, range 3 months to 17 years). Follow-up time was 8.5 +\/- 4.6 months for the traditional system group (304 cumulated months) and 7.2 +\/- 3.6 months for the disconnect systems group (116 cumulated months). Peritonitis rates were 1 episode every 10 months for group A, versus 1 episode every 58 months for group B (p &lt; 0.05). Our results strongly suggest that disconnect systems for peritoneal dialysis can significantly decrease peritonitis rates, although longer follow-up periods are needed.","1006":"The aim of these studies was an evaluation of peritoneal filtration fraction (PFF) in uremic patients dialyzed using 1.5% glucose peritoneal dialysis solution: 1. with pH 6.22 +\/- 0.01, without any drugs; 2. adjusted to pH 7.25 +\/- 0.02 with 1 M NaOH, without any drugs; 3. as 1. but with the addition of sodium nitroprusside (5 mg\/L); 4. as 1. but with the addition of chlorpromazine (2.5 mg\/L); 5. as 1. but with the addition of isoprenaline HCL (0.5 mg\/L). Investigations with every kind of solution (1.-5.) were carried out in 10 patients. PFF (%) was calculated as [formula: see text] where nUFR (mL\/min) = net ultrafiltration rate; Hct (L\/L) = hematocrit; EPBF (mL\/min) = effective peritoneal capillary blood flow estimated as diffusive mass transfer coefficient of carbon dioxide gas. It was shown that alkalinization of dialysis solution, sodium nitroprusside, or chlorpromazine do not influence PFF, whereas isoprenaline HCL (0.5 mg\/L) increases PFF when added to the dialysis solution of pH = 6.22.","1007":"Over 700 people attending the Opening Session of the Fourteenth Annual Peritoneal Dialysis Conference participated in the computer interaction exercise as keyboard responders. Responders were 50.5% nurses and 40.4% physicians. Of these, 70.4% were from North America and 19.6% were from Europe. Only 9.5% had been involved in chronic peritoneal dialysis for less than one year. Over half (56%) worked in programs with more than 30 chronic peritoneal dialysis patients. Their own personal choice of dialysis therapy was a form of chronic peritoneal dialysis in 82%. Serum albumin concentration was indicated as the main monitor of nutritional status by 79.1%. Dietary protein intake ranging from 1-1.2 was considered the preferred goal by 84.4% of responders, even though the majority of chronic peritoneal dialysis patients probably do not achieve dietary protein intake in this range. A minimum weekly KT\/V urea of 1.7 was chosen as a minimum target by 53.4%. An increase in exchange volume was the most frequently chosen approach to the large, anuric, low-peritoneal transporter. Numerous other questions dealing with adequacy and nutrition were posed to the audience, and the findings are summarized herein.","1008":"This study evaluates the dialysis-related infection rate in children receiving peritoneal dialysis with Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage. Children with S. aureus nasal carriage were randomized to treatment with rifampin and bacitracin or no treatment. The children were observed for one month after randomization for evidence of a S. aureus dialysis-related infection. Individuals with nasal carriage had a higher incidence of S. aureus dialysis-related infection than those patients without carriage (p &lt; 0.05). Those children treated for nasal carriage had a lower dialysis-related infection rate than those who were untreated (p &lt; 0.05). We conclude that children receiving peritoneal dialysis with nasal carriage of S. aureus are at a greater risk of developing a S. aureus dialysis-related infection. The treatment of nasal carriage in this population decreased the risk of a S. aureus dialysis-related infection.","1009":"Intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) is easy to measure routinely in children on peritoneal dialysis (PD) (especially with the twin bag Y-set) as described in adults: value expressed in centimeters of water, average of IPP (mean IPP) at inspiration and at expiration, with point zero located on the mid-axillary line while the patient rests in a perfectly supine position. IPP remained high during the first two to three days postsurgical peritoneal catheter implantation (15 +\/- 4 cm) despite low dialysate volume per exchange (10 mL\/kg). Afterwards, IPP decreased (10 +\/- 2 cm) despite increasing dialysate volume from 10-50 mL\/kg. Mean IPP seemed lower in infants (5 +\/- 3 cm) in contrast to children (10 +\/- 2 cm) on chronic PD with dialysate volume of 1000 mL\/m2. There was a strong negative linear correlation between ultrafiltration (UF) volume and mean IPP with isotonic dialysate (1.36% dextrose concentration). By contrast, there was only a weak positive linear correlation between UF volume and mean IPP with hypertonic dialysate (3.86% dextrose concentration).","1010":"Continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD) was performed in 13 children with acute renal failure (ARF) in our intensive care units (ICU). The median age was 6 months (range 3 days to 77 months). Sixty-nine percent of the patients (9\/13) were below the age of 12 months. CPD was performed for a median duration of 5 days (range 1-35 days). In 62% of the patients (8\/13), the cause of ARF was acute tubular necrosis (ATN) due to cardiac surgery. The outcome of CPD regarding total survival was 54% (7\/13). A high mortality was registered (83% of the deaths [5\/6]) within the first year of life, which suggests a worse prognosis if ARF occurs at this age. Half of the total deaths (3\/6) were among the cardiac surgery patients. Peritoneal equilibration tests (PET) were performed utilizing measurement of urea and glucose transport through the peritoneal membrane at short intervals during a period of 45-60 min from the start of treatment. Short dwell times of 5-20 min were found to be sufficient for adequate uremic control until a satisfactory daily urine production was noted. CPD is a useful and simple treatment modality for ARF in critically ill ICU children. Equilibration tests are useful and should be considered for optimization of CPD treatment in critically ill children with ARF in order to achieve the goal of controlling uremia and fluid overload, and giving nutritional support.","1011":"It has been shown that hyperhomocysteinemia is a risk factor for atherosclerotic vascular disease. In this study, we measured total plasma homocysteine in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients and evaluated its correlation with atherosclerosis. Subjects consisted of healthy volunteers, and hemodialysis (HD) and CAPD patients. Fluoro-HPLC was employed to estimate plasma levels of total homocysteine (Hcy). Plasma levels of total Hcy were significantly higher in the CAPD patients compared with the HD patients and controls. Atherosclerotic score (ASS) was calculated, and the correspondence with plasma levels of total Hcy was analyzed. There was a significant correlation between plasma levels of total Hcy and ASS in CAPD patients. However, plasma levels of total Hcy did not correlate with age, plasma vitamin B6 level, residual renal function, protein catabolic rate (PCR), or KT\/V. Our present study suggests that elevated concentrations of total plasma Hcy might play a role in the development of atherosclerosis in CAPD patients.","1012":"Correction of anemia with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) has been associated with improvement of several endocrine abnormalities. However, long-term effects of this therapy on pituitary secretion in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is not known. The aim of the present work was to assess the growth hormone (GH) and cortisol responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia before and after the correction of anemia with rHuEPO therapy in CAPD patients. Five well-nourished and clinically stable patients were studied before and after 12-24 weeks of rHuEPO treatment. Seven normal volunteers were studied as controls. Insulin-induced hypoglycemia tests were performed prior to starting rHuEPO therapy and again after partial correction of anemia. Blood samples for GH, cortisol, and glucose were collected between -30 and 120 min after insulin (0.1 U\/kg bw) administration. GH responses to hypoglycemic stress were characterized by marked differences in single patients when compared with the control group. However, the GH peak and the area under the secretory curves (AUC) of GH responses in CAPD patients (10.6 +\/- 4.8 micrograms\/L and 15.4 +\/- 6.1 micrograms h\/L, respectively) did not differ from those obtained in control subjects (14.3 +\/- 4.1 micrograms\/L and 19.4 +\/- 3.5 micrograms h\/L, respectively). The study, after correction of anemia, showed an evident decrease of GH values at each time point on the response curve in 4 patients, and no modification in 1 patient. Mean values of GH peak and AUC were 8.8 +\/- 2.8 micrograms\/L and 9.6 +\/- 2.3 micrograms h\/L.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1013":"Pulse calcitriol therapy (IV or per os) has been efficacious in hemodialysis (HD) patients to inhibit parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels, but there are very poor data for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. For this reason, we used calcitriol (C) per os (0.75-1.5 micrograms three times weekly) in 19\/54 patients who had PTH &gt; 150 pg\/mL (on peritoneal dialytic treatment for 6-114 months, weekly KT\/V 2.01 +\/- 0.43); 16% were in therapy with calcium (Ca) carbonate, 26% with calcium acetate alone, and 58% with calcium acetate associated with magnesium (Mg) carbonate and reduction of dialysate Ca (CaD) and dialysate Mg (MgD), respectively, to 1.25 and 0.25 mmol\/L. In 5 patients (26%), a further reduction of CaD to 0 mmol\/L has been necessary, and 3 patients must be considered nonresponders after three months of treatment. In conclusion, the use of calcitriol as pulse therapy (three times weekly), and at low doses, allows a good control of secondary hyperparathyroidism in 85% of patients who are using phosphate binders without aluminum, if CaD is reduced in some patients to 1.25 or even to 0 mmol\/L.","1014":"The aim of these studies was a comparison of effective peritoneal blood flow (EPBF) during intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD) in uremic patients with varying primary renal disease, sex, age, body weight, and IPD duration. EPBF was estimated by calculation of diffusive mass transfer coefficient (KBD) of carbon dioxide at 2.5 min dwell of 1.5% glucose dialysis solution (2 L). EPBF estimated during IPD in 21 patients was a mean of flow rates obtained in each patient at the beginning, in the middle, and at the end of 1-2 dialyses. Our results suggest that EPBF during IPD is not significantly dependent on primary renal disease, sex, age, and body weight, nor does it change during the first few months of IPD.","1015":"This study was undertaken to evaluate the long-term effect of single weekly oral pulse calcitriol therapy (0.05 mcg\/kg) in 16 uremic patients. Eight (5 female, 3 male; aged 51.6 +\/- 8.5 years) were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for 28.8 +\/- 12.7 months with basal intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH) 247 +\/- 60 pg\/mL. Eight (6 female, 2 male; aged 53 +\/- 17.9 years) were on hemodialysis (HD) for 76.3 +\/- 55 months with basal iPTH 270.9 +\/- 92. Calcium dialysate was 1.75 mmol\/L in all patients and serum phosphorus was controlled with CaCO3 2-4 g\/day. Ca and P were measured weekly; iPTH and alkaline phosphatase were measured monthly. After two months, iPTH decreased to 132.4 +\/- 89 (p &lt; 0.05 vs basal values) in the HD patients and to 158.2 +\/- 61 (p &lt; 0.05) in the CAPD group. After six months, iPTH decreased to 108.6 +\/- 73.2 (p &lt; 0.01) in the HD patients and to 126.5 +\/- 48 (p &lt; 0.01) in the CAPD patients. Two patients (1 HD and 1 CAPD) who were not compliant with phosphate binder therapy were dropped. To control hyperphosphatemia in 1 HD patient we reduced bolus to 0.03 mcg\/kg. Two CAPD patients presented hypercalcemia and required calcium dialysate of 1.25 mmol\/L. In conclusion, single weekly oral pulse of calcitriol appears to be effective in suppressing mild hyperparathyroidism both in CAPD and in HD patients, even though some variations in the protocols may be required.","1016":"Both intravenous and oral 1,25(OH)2 D3 pulse therapy are effective in decreasing iPTH in patients with chronic renal failure. In order to understand why intermittent application of calcitriol is effective, we investigated 10 children with advanced renal failure (4 female, 6 male; median age 6.5 [3-16] years; body surface area 0.58-1.57m2; CCR 7 [5-47] mL\/min\/1.73m2) with elevated baseline concentrations of 1,84iPTH (median 63.5 [9.4-300] pmol\/L). After a standard dose of 2 micrograms calcitriol per os (equal to 1.27-3.45 micrograms\/m2), serum 1,25(OH)2D3 concentrations increased. The peak concentration occurred after 6 h (3-12), and 1,25(OH)2D3 serum levels returned to baseline by 48 h. 1,84iPTH concentrations were significantly suppressed by 6-72 h. The median maximal decrease was 51.4% of baseline (22.3%-74%). The decrement was a function of baseline 1,84iPTH, but not of 1,25(OH)2D3 serum peak concentration, area under the curve, body surface area, or change in ionized serum calcium. We conclude: (i) oral 1,25(OH)2D3 has a prolonged (up to 72 h) suppressive effect on 1,84iPTH concentrations in uremic patients, and (ii) the wide interindividual variation in suppression of 1,84iPTH was not explained by the kinetics of 1,25(OH)2D3 concentration, which implies that additional factors influence the 1,84iPTH response to 1,25(OH)2D3.","1017":"To further study the effect of pulse oral calcitriol on the level of intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH), we have studied the response of 43 patients treated with 5.0 mcg calcitriol bi-weekly for one year. Mean iPTH decreased from 603 pg\/mL +\/- 262 (+\/- SD) to 222 pg\/mL +\/- 185 (p &lt; 0.001). Thirty-six patients responded showing a decrease in iPTH from baseline; 7 patients showed no decrease in iPTH. Transient hypercalcemia (calcium &gt; 10.5 mg\/dL) was noted in 6 patients of the responder group which corrected with temporary discontinuation of pulse therapy. Pulse oral calcitriol is an effective therapy to decrease elevated iPTH levels in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients with hyperparathyroidism.","1018":"So far, no one has devised ideal, on-line mixed bicarbonate solutions for hemodialysis and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) because current preparations can lead to precipitation of calcium and magnesium carbonate during treatment. The author has prepared a new, single bicarbonate dialysis solution that contains glycylglycine (BiGG). With a bicarbonate\/glycylglycine ratio of 30\/10 mM\/L, this solution has a stable pH of 7.35; sterilized through a 0.22 micron filter, it remains stable for over 15 months when stored at 10 degrees-40 degrees C. When infused (40 mL\/kg bw) in rabbits daily for 25 days, the BiGG solution showed excellent peritoneal-membrane tolerance and biocompatibility. Comparative ultrafiltration (UF) studies with BiGG and standard lactate (La) solutions in rabbits showed that net UF with La solution peaked at 2 h and decreased significantly at 4 h and 6 h. Net UF with BiGG solution peaked at 4 h and was sustained at 6 h; in all instance it was greater than that of La solution by approximately 15%, 30%, and 40% at 2, 4, and 6 h, respectively. During the initial 2-h dwell period, the pH of La solution increased from an initial 5.5 to 7.18, whereas that of the BiGG solution remained stable at 7.35. In all rabbits, the peritoneal fluid contained phosphatidylcholine at all times. However, its concentration was significantly higher in animals receiving the BiGG solution than in those receiving the La solution. The author concludes that this new single BiGG PD solution is simple to use, stable, and of a normal pH.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1019":"During long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD) treatment, the biocompatibility of the dialysis fluid is one of the factors that determine the functional integrity of the peritoneal mesothelium and stroma, and the alertness and functional capacity of the peritoneal host defense system. In vitro studies show that conventional acidic lactate-based PD solutions (LB fluids) are detrimental to some of the more important functions of the peritoneal cell system including mesothelial and white blood cells. The main toxic components of the fluids are the high hydrogen ion content (pH = 5-5.6), high lactate concentration, and osmolality. Some toxic side effects can be omitted using bicarbonate-based fluids (BB fluids), in which lactate has been replaced by bicarbonate and the pH has been normalized (7.2-7.4). The present paper is an overview of the biocompatibility tests and studies performed using bicarbonate-based continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) fluids. While the final long-term clinical evaluation of the BB fluids is still missing, biocompatibility tests indicate that these fluids are less toxic to many cell systems than the conventional acidic LB fluids. BB fluids with a high glucose content remain cytotoxic. The BB fluids are well tolerated in animal studies. Some BB fluids increase the ultrafiltration in short-term animal studies when compared with LB fluids. The few animal studies failed to demonstrate a better preservation of the peritoneal membrane integrity by BB fluids. The difference in cell toxicity between LB and BB fluids as measured in vitro also seems detectable during the first 30 min of intraperitoneal dwell in man.","1020":"The effects of a recently introduced peritoneal dialysis fluid (PDF) containing amino acids (AA) were compared with those of a glucose-based PDF (G-PDF) on viability and function of donor granulocytes (PMNs) in vitro. After 30 min incubation in the PDF, viability, assessed by trypan blue exclusion, and phagocytosis capacity (PC), tested in two assays using a fluorescein and a 3H-labeled Staphylococcus epidermidis strain, were significantly better in AA-PDF than in G-PDF (p &lt; 0.002 in the 3H-assay). Bactericidal activity was not different in the PDFs. If pH of G-PDF was adjusted from 5.2 to neutral, differences in PC disappeared. In AA-PDF, PMN chemiluminescence (CL) response was significantly higher than in G-PDF (p &lt; 0.003). At neutral pH, however, PMNs showed a significant stronger CL-response in 1.36% G-PDF than in AA-PDF (p &lt; 0.05). These data suggest that this AA-PDF has little detrimental effect on phagocyte viability and function. The improved compatibility over G-PDF in in vitro tests seems to be pH dependent. The reduced chemiluminescence response compared to 1.36% G-PDF with neutral pH is possibly due to quenching by (one of the) amino acids and osmolarity.","1021":"In order to evaluate the injury to the mesothelial cell layer during long-term peritoneal dialysis (PD), a dialysis solution (solution A), buffered with bicarbonate, stabilized with 10 mmol\/L glycylglycine, and sterilized by filtration (0.22 micron double filtration, pH = 7.4), was compared to traditional heat sterilized lactate solution (solution B) on human mesothelial cell cultures. The respective effects of both solutions were evaluated on first passage cells by 3H thymidine incorporation after 72-, 96-, 120-, and 144-h contact. Mesothelial cells to be cultured were obtained from the omentum biopsies of 7 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients (during first peritoneal catheter placement) and from 7 non-ESRD patients undergoing abdominal surgery. Solution A (diluted 1\/5) induced a time-dependent stimulation of growth in 6 cases of ESRD patient cell cultures, and inhibition occurred only in 1 case. Stimulation was also observed in 5 non-ESRD patient cell cultures, and no effect occurred in 2 cases. Solution B inhibited growth in all the cultures except in 1 case of an ESRD patient in which no effect was observed. This study shows that solution A induced mesothelial cell proliferation, while an inhibitory effect of solution B was observed. No significant differences were observed between the sensitivity of mesothelial cells from ESRD and non-ESRD patients. Further analysis will be carried out to identify precisely the cause of the differences observed: buffer or glycylglycine by themselves and\/or glucose by-products.","1022":"The authors studied the in vitro effect of overnight \"dwelled\" dialysate obtained from 5 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients on the growth of, and protein synthesis by, peritoneal mesothelial cells and fibroblasts. In each patient, an overnight exchange was performed with Dianeal 2.5% on day 1 and with a solution containing amino acids 1.1% on day 2. Both types of dialysate supported the proliferation of fibroblasts and mesothelial cells, but the amino acid dialysate had a stronger effect on the growth of mesothelial cells than the Dianeal dialysate did. In the presence of either dialysate, synthesis of noncollagen proteins by mesothelial cells and fibroblasts was low. By contrast, the synthesis of collagen was enhanced, and the Dianeal dialysate had a much stronger effect than the amino acid dialysate did. Present results show that, during its intraperitoneal dwell, dialysis fluid within the peritoneal cavity stimulates the generation of bioactive substances which affect the function of peritoneal cells. This reaction is influenced by the composition of the dialysis solution.","1023":"The authors studied the effect of sodium lactate (NaLact) on the function of human peritoneal fibroblasts (F) in vitro. NaLact inhibits the proliferation of fibroblasts in a dose-dependent way: at a concentration of 40 mM, it decreases the growth of these cells by 34%. A similar effect was observed with other solutes (glucose, mannitol, sodium chloride) at identical concentrations, suggesting that the factor responsible for slower growth of the cells was hyperosmolality. When applied to fibroblast monolayers, NaLact (40 mM) increased the synthesis of total proteins by 10%. Exposure of the fibroblasts to NaLact did not increase noncollagen protein production, and the observed increase in total protein synthesis was due to the increased synthesis of collagen. We could not reproduce this effect of lactate on fibroblast collagen synthesis with other osmotic solutes. Our results suggest that dialysis fluid hyperosmolality may be one of the factors responsible for the decrease of the cellular components within the peritoneal interstitium; whereas NaLact is specifically responsible for the increased production of collagen by peritoneal fibroblasts, leading to the deposition of masses of collagen in the extracellular space.","1024":"","1025":"We have developed a catheter extension\/continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) set (ANDY high flow set) of larger lumen (minimum internal diameter 3.25 mm), and compared peritoneal dialysate flow rates in two groups of 6 stable CAPD patients of comparable age, sex distribution, and time on dialysis according to type of catheter. Both groups were studied with two different extension\/sets, standard ANDY and ANDY high flow set. The shortest infusion time was observed with the combination Cruz catheter\/ANDY high flow set. The switch to a high flow set decreased significantly the inflow time of both types of catheter, and the infusion time of the Tenckhoff catheter\/ANDY high flow combination approximated that of the Cruz\/ANDY combination. Likewise, the dialysate outflow rates were highest with the Cruz catheter\/ANDY high flow set than with any other catheter\/set combination (p = 0.005). This was apparent, not only in the total outflow time, but also in the vol\/min during the first 4 min (p = 0.005). None of the patients experienced discomfort during the dialysis exchanges with the high flow system. This combination of Cruz catheter\/high flow set effectively reduces the dialysis exchange time and is very much appreciated by the patients.","1026":"A review of 332 patients initiating continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) treatment from January 1988 throughout September 1993, with a total observation time of 5237 patient-months. Seven peritoneal dialysis (PD) systems were used, three of which were comparable regarding patient characteristics: standard system (Baxter) and two disconnect systems, Twinbag (Baxter) and Gemini (Gambro). The two disconnect systems were identical in principle, except that Twinbag used iodine as disinfectant of connections and Gemini used alcohol as disinfectant. We found a reduction of peritonitis rates in one of the disconnect systems--Twinbag (iodine) 0.42 episodes\/patient\/year--and a slight increase in another disconnect system--Gemini (alcohol) 1.17 epi\/patient\/yr--compared to standard system (iodine) 0.92 epi\/patient\/yr. An improvement of exit-site infections (ESI) and tunnel infections was seen in both disconnect systems (0.17 and 0.20 epi\/patient\/yr) compared to standard system (0.35 epi\/patient\/yr). Introduction of disconnect CAPD system reduced peritonitis rates in systems using iodine as disinfectant. Disconnect systems reduced ESI, probably due to less trauma to the catheter. We recommend the use of disconnect CAPD systems using iodine instead of alcohol as disinfectant.","1027":"The aim of this study was to verify whether the replacement of the peritoneal catheter in a single operation and during infectious complications of peritoneal dialysis is effective and safe. Sixty-eight infectious complications refractory to appropriate antibiotic therapy were treated by this technique: 26 tunnel infections, 22 peritonitis-complicating tunnel infections, 12 refractory peritonitis, and 8 recurrent peritonitis. Operations were successful in all cases of tunnel infection and recurring peritonitis, and in all cases but one of peritonitis-complicating tunnel infection. Ten failures occurred among the 12 catheters removed for refractory peritonitis. Microorganisms cultured in these 10 failures were: Fungi (3 cases), Mycobacterium (2 cases), Pseudomonas (2 cases), Acinetobacter (1 case), Acinetobacter+Pseudomonas (1 case), and Enterococcus (1 case). Complications were 3 one-way obstructions and 2 external dialysate leaks. This study supports the simultaneous catheter replacement-removal procedure during infectious complications of peritoneal dialysis (PD) with the exception of refractory peritonitis; this technique spares the patient the temporary vascular access, the shift to hemodialysis, and a second operation to insert a new catheter. There are few complications.","1028":"We reviewed the incidence and risk factors for complications after insertion of permanent catheters for peritoneal dialysis (PD). We implanted 192 peritoneal catheters in 137 patients over ten years. Fifty-three complications were observed in 50 catheters (27.6%) implanted in 42 patients (30.6%): malposition or omental entrapment (13%), dialysate leak (8.9%), hemoperitoneum (3.6%), peritonitis (1%), surgical wound infection (0.5%), and chylous ascites (0.5%). The only significant risk factors for a complicated insertion were previous abdominal surgery, particularly if it affected the peritoneal membrane, and early use of the catheter after implantation (&lt; 5 days), independent of surgical or closed insertion.","1029":"To decrease the incidence of exit-site infection, the Swan neck catheter has been used since 1991. Twenty-six patients received Swan neck catheter implants over the past three years. Fifteen patients suffered from exit-site infections and 2 of them developed tunnel infections. The incidence of exit-site or tunnel infections in the Swan neck group revealed no difference from those patients receiving Tenckhoff tube implants (n = 154). Two patients in the Swan neck group and 8 in the Tenckhoff group had tube migrations. There was no difference between the two groups. No patient in the Swan neck group suffered from cuff extrusion or pericatheter leakage, while 9 in the Tenckhoff group suffered from cuff extrusions and 5 had pericatheter leakages. The cumulative catheter survival rates at one, two, and three years in the Swan neck group were 90.9%, 80.2%, and 67.9%, while those in the Tenckhoff group were 84.7%, 67.9%, and 54%. We conclude that the patients receiving Swan neck catheter implantations had a lower incidence of cuff extrusion and pericatheter leakage, and better catheter survival, though the incidence of exit-site\/tunnel infection and tube migration was no better than in the Tenckhoff catheter group.","1030":"A decrease in the peritonitis rate and the incidence of catheter exit-site\/tunnel (E\/T) infection are the most important factors affecting the permanent peritoneal catheter in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Moncrief et al. have introduced a novel methodology (two phases) for peritoneal catheter placement (7.8). The most relevant characteristic is that the external portion remains buried on the subcutaneous tissue (sterile environment) during the healing process. After four to six weeks, the catheter is brought out through a small incision (0.5 cm) distal 2 cm from the subcutaneous cuff, and peritoneal dialysis may be initiated. The data available, presented by Moncrief et al., show a lower incidence of peritonitis rate and E\/T infection with this implantation technique, when compared with a classic technique. The aim of this study is to learn if the placement of a peritoneal catheter with Moncrief's methodology decreases the incidence of complications related to peritoneal catheters. We treated 29 patients (group C) with the conventional procedure and 25 patients (group M) with the Moncrief technique. Follow-up was similar for both groups (C = 12.2 +\/- 7.9 months vs M = 11.1 +\/- 6.1 months, NS). The time buried was 3.23 +\/- 0.9 weeks (2-5). Eleven patients completed four weeks with the catheter buried subcutaneously (group M-4). The incidence of E\/T infection was similar for groups C and M, and lower in group M-4 (p &lt; 0.05). The number of catheters free of infection was less in group C (31%) than in group M (46%) and M-4 (67%) (p &lt; 0.01).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1031":"Bacterial colonization potentials by Staphylococcus aureus (Staph. aureus) were determined in silver peritoneal dialysis (PD) catheter materials and were compared to colonization of the same bacteria in silastic catheter materials. The bacteria were colonized in two different experimental systems: In Vitro: In an in vitro biofilm bacterial culture system with a modified Robbins' device (MRD), seven different clinical strains of Staph. aureus were grown in PD effluents on silver or silastic catheter discs, each 0.5 cm in diameter. In identical experimental conditions, reduced bacterial growth was detected in silver catheter discs compared to growth on silastic discs, but the results were not statistically different (p = 0.12). In Vivo: In a rabbit model of PD the, in vivo colonization potential of Staph. aureus was examined in two groups of rabbits using silver (n = 3) and silastic (n = 3) PD catheters. The exit sites of the PD catheters were inoculated with a single strain of Staph. aureus for six days, followed by PD for six days. The rabbits were then sacrificed. After sacrifice, comparison between the bacterial counts of identical segments of silver and silastic catheters showed that there had been a reduction in the growth of Staph. aureus in vivo on silver PD catheters, contrary to the increased growth on the silastic catheters (p &lt; 0.05). Reduced bacterial growth on the silver PD catheters in vivo indicates that the release of silver in tissues over time cause antibacterial effects in vivo. Further in vivo experiments are needed before future clinical use of silver catheters in PD patients.","1032":"","1033":"Infections associated with implants are frequently resistant to conventional antibiotic therapy. This resistance has been ascribed to the presence of bacteria on the artificial surface within a protective glue-like matrix forming a bacterial biofilm. We have demonstrated that experimental biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis, the main pathogen associated with implantation, are exquisitely sensitive to the action of rifampin. This effect of rifampin is incomplete, however, with the emergence of rifampin-resistant survivors that readily repopulate the biofilm. Studies were therefore performed to determine the effect of combinations of 13 different antibiotics with rifampin against standardized S. epidermidis biofilm preparations in an in vitro assay enabling the kinetic measurement of antibiotic action over a five-day period. The antibiotic combinations with rifampin demonstrated unsuspected divergent patterns of antimicrobial activity against the biofilms: 1. rapid synergy with rifampin was observed with cell-wall active antibiotics (cloxacillin, cephalothin, cefazolin, and cefamandole), whereas slower synergy occurred with vancomycin, ciprofloxacin, tetracycline, and amikacin; 2. some antibiotics (tobramycin, erythromycin, clindamycin, fusidic acid) did not influence the outcome; 3. gentamicin unexpectedly showed marked antagonism to rifampin. These results are relevant to the design of optimal therapeutic regimens for the management of resistant implant-associated infections.","1034":"Implant-associated infections offer resistance to antibiotic treatment and possibly do so because the causative bacteria which reside on the artificial surface are enclosed in a protective matrix (biofilm) shielding the bacteria against the action of host defenses and antibiotic action. We have investigated in vitro the effect of various antimicrobial agents on biofilms of Staphylococcus epidermidis, which is the main organism responsible for implant-associated infections. Rifampin was found to exert superior activity, albeit incomplete, against S. epidermidis biofilms using an assay system which enabled the determination of the kinetics of antibiotic action over five days. In a large screening study looking for agents capable of completing the action of rifampin, gentamicin was unexpectedly found to be antagonistic to rifampin. The present study was undertaken to investigate further the activity of gentamicin and five other aminoglycoside antibiotics using a wider range of concentrations (2.5-20 micrograms\/mL). The main findings were a marked synergy with rifampin demonstrated by streptomycin, producing a bactericidal outcome, which contrasted sharply with the indifference or antagonism shown by the other aminoglycosides. We then studied in further detail the effect of separate combinations of streptomycin and gentamicin with rifampin over a wider concentration range of each agent (1.25-40 micrograms\/mL). Streptomycin showed strong rapid synergy with rifampin even at the lowest concentration of each antibiotic. Gentamicin demonstrated a concentration-related antagonism towards rifampin which was independent of rifampin concentration. The data support the conclusion that streptomycin, like cell-wall active antibiotics, exerts a potent synergy with rifampin against S. epidermidis biofilms, and that the other aminoglycosides, predominantly gentamicin, strongly antagonize rifampin action.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1035":"Cefuroxime is a second-generation cephalosporin that can be used for the treatment of peritoneal dialysis-related peritonitis. Cefuroxime-axetil is an orally available pro-drug of cefuroxime. The effect of concomitant use of a phosphate binder on the bioavailability of cefuroxime-axetil was studied in 7 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients who had not recently suffered from peritonitis. On two occasions, we measured cefuroxime levels in plasma, peritoneal effluent, and urine for 24 h after the ingestion of 1 g of cefuroxime-axetil: once together with a phosphate binder (+PB) and once without (-PB). Peak plasma concentrations (Cmax) were +PB: 22.7 mg\/L (15.3-32.6) (median and range) and -PB: 23.2 mg\/L (18.9-27.4). The area under the curve (AUC) of the plasma levels was +PB: 364 mg h\/L (247-530) and -PB: 368 mg h\/L (296-438). The plasma elimination half-life (t1\/2) was +PB: 13.9 h (11.5-14.6) and -PB: 13.8 h (12.2-15.4). Cefuroxime concentrations in the peritoneal effluent from the first exchange were 1.9 mg\/L (0.5-6.2) (+PB) and 3.4 mg\/L (2.1-4.7) (-PB). In the peritoneal effluent from the second up to the last exchange, the cefuroxime levels were stable at +PB: 5.0 mg\/L (2.0-8.8) and -PB: 5.3 mg\/L (1.8-7.5). The total amount of cefuroxime excreted into peritoneal effluent and urine was +PB: 82 mg (30-124), -PB: 100 mg (36-129). So Cmax, AUC, t1\/2 and the total amount of excreted cefuroxime were not different. Therefore, the bioavailability of cefuroxime-axetil is not reduced by the use of a phosphate binder.","1036":"A portion of peritonitis episodes are reported as culture-negative or as initial no growth peritonitis (INGP). To determine if demographics, symptoms, signs, treatment, and outcome were different in INGP when compared to culture-positive peritonitis (Pos), we examined data from the Network 9 Peritonitis and Catheter Survival Study. Only peritonitis episodes occurring in adults with peritoneal dialysis (PD) fluid WBC counts greater than 100 were included in the analysis. INGP accounted for 14% of the episodes of peritonitis. Organisms grew out of 13 of the 37 patients in INGP that were recultured: 3 fungal, 5 gram-negative, and 5 gram-positive isolates. A difference in culture methodology for the two groups could not be detected. There was no difference in gender, race, incidence of diabetes, previous peritonitis, or exit-site infections between the two groups. INGP had a greater percentage of patients over age 70 (23.3% vs 14.7%, p &lt; 0.05), and a larger percentage of INGP patients placed additives in their dialysate (55% vs 43.6%, p &lt; 0.05). There was no difference in symptoms or signs between the two groups. The INGP group had half the catheter removal rate (9\/103 vs 110\/630 for Pos, p &lt; 0.05), otherwise, there was no difference in the rate of hospitalization, death, or switch to hemodialysis. There was no difference in types of drugs used or method of drug administration between the two groups.

We report 6 cases of fungal peritonitis observed between 1980 and 1992 in our center. The etiologic agents were: Candida spp., C. guilliermondi, C. parapsilosis, C. albicans, and Verticillium spp. All 6 patients had suffered at least one episode of bacterial peritonitis in the two months before the fungal infection appeared and were all treated by intraperitoneal administration of antibiotics. The catheter was removed early in 3 patients followed by antimycotic therapy, while the remaining 3 patients received antimycotic therapy, with removal of the catheter in a later stage. The result in the first group was that they all switched permanently to hemodialysis, while in the second group there were 2 deaths and 1 transfer to hemodialysis. In the light of these 6 cases, we analyzed 22 published reports to assess risk factors, therapy, and outcome of this pathology. The major predisposing factors were intraperitoneal antibiotics and bacterial peritonitis, and the best results were obtained by continuing PD plus intraperitoneal and systemic antifungal agents.","1038":"The identification of organisms is important in the treatment of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) peritonitis. We compared two techniques for isolating organisms in CAPD peritonitis. Clinical and microbiologic data on all episodes of peritonitis from 1991-1993 were prospectively recorded. The isolation of organisms from 77 episodes of peritonitis was done using the conventional centrifugation culture method from 1991-1992; the isolation of organisms from 121 episodes of peritonitis was done using the BACTEC method from 1992-1993. The total culture-positive rates were 75% for the BACTEC technique and 58% for the conventional technique (p = 0.05), with a higher isolation rate for gram-negative organisms (36% vs 18%, p &lt; 0.05). In the isolation of organisms from new episodes of peritonitis, the culture-positive rates were significantly higher for the BACTEC than for the conventional technique (82% vs 55%, p &lt; 0.01). The recovery rates of organisms for both techniques were similar for relapse peritonitis. The treatment outcomes of CAPD peritonitis for the two technique groups, and for the culture-positive and culture-negative groups were not significantly different. In conclusion, the BACTEC method yielded a higher rate of positive cultures for CAPD peritonitis, but did not affect treatment outcome of the infections.","1039":"Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of S. aureus exit-site infections, but its association with peritonitis is less well established. We performed a four-year prospective study to determine the relationship between S. aureus continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)-related infections and nasal carriage. All patients who had been started on CAPD from 1989 to 1992 had regular nose cultures. S. aureus nasal carriage was defined as two of three positive nose cultures. A total of 41 carriers and 105 noncarriers were studied. The rates of S. aureus exit-site infection (0.23 vs 0.09 episode\/patient\/year, p &lt; 0.005), peritonitis (0.33 vs 0.10 episode\/patient\/year, p &lt; 0.005), and catheter loss (0.12 vs 0.05, p &lt; 0.01) were significantly higher among the carriers. Life-table analysis showed a significant risk of S. aureus exit-site infection and peritonitis for carriers (p &lt; 0.01). Logistic regression analysis showed that S. aureus nasal carriage was the most important predictive factor for S. aureus peritonitis. In conclusion, our study showed that S. aureus nasal carriage is related to an increased incidence of S. aureus CAPD-related infections.","1040":"Whether nasal carriage of Staphylococcus aureus is associated with an increased risk of S. aureus exit-site infection remains controversial. We performed nasal cultures prior to peritoneal dialysis catheter placement in all of our patients beginning in September 1990. We also performed nasal cultures on a cohort of patients already on peritoneal dialysis. Patients with positive cultures received a prescription for a ten-day course of intranasal mupirocin. Exit-site and nasal cultures were performed on every subsequent office visit until the end of the study in April 1993. The initial visit and three widely-spaced subsequent visits were chosen for data analysis. There were 68 patients entered into the study. Data from a total of 272 visits were analyzed. The patients ranged in age from 18-80 years. There were 27 diabetics. We found no correlation between initial positive nasal cultures and the subsequent development of a S. aureus exit-site infection. All identified nasal carriers were treated with mupirocin. However, the subsequent development of a S. aureus exit-site infection could not be correlated to a prior S. aureus carrier state or lack thereof.","1041":"It has been reported that nasal carriage of staphylococci may contribute to infections of the continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) catheter exit site or cause peritonitis due to this pathogen. Recently, a nasal ointment to eradicate these bacteria in patients and staff has been marketed with the implication that this treatment may reduce infection rates. In this study, we investigated 37 patients treated with CAPD for a mean of 38.8 +\/- 6.4 months. Presence of nasal carriage of staphylococci was assessed using standard nasal swab techniques and related to bacteria identified at the time of previous infections. Results were analyzed using Spearman rank order correlation and linear regression analysis. In 119.5 patient years at risk, 50 infections with staphylococci (24 episodes of peritonitis and 26 exit-site infections) were evaluated. Nineteen patients were carriers of S. aureus or S. epidermidis; 6 patients were carrying both species. There was no correlation of current nasal carriage of staphylococci with previous infection. Although 23 of 37 patients were carriers, 14 of these never had infections due to nasal staphylococci. Only in 14 of 50 infections were bacteria species the same in the nose and at the site of infection. We conclude that prospective trials demonstrating a reduction of CAPD-related infections are needed before general use of prophylactic nasal antibiotic treatment can be recommended in these patients.","1042":"The purpose of the study was to review a single center's experience with the disconnect system for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), and to evaluate peritonitis incidence with and without use of iodine-containing clamp shields. The retrospective review of patients using the disconnect system lasted from January 1991 throughout March 1993, evaluating the peritonitis incidence with and without use of iodine clamp shields. In the observation period, a total of 103 patients were evaluated. Of these, 42 patients were treated with iodine clamp shields until July 1992 and then were instructed not to use the iodine clamp shields, thus acting as their own controls. We found an overall peritonitis incidence of 0.411 episodes\/patient\/year (= 29.2 patient-months\/episode) on disconnect CAPD-system (Baxter), in spite of the fact that more than 60% of our dialysis population is treated with peritoneal dialysis. We found no difference in peritonitis rates with or without the use of iodine clamp shields. Peritonitis rates with clamp shields were 0.400 episodes\/patient\/year and, without clamp shields, were 0.400 episodes\/patient\/year. The introduction of a disconnect system provided a system with low incidence of peritonitis. No difference in peritonitis rates was observed with or without the use of iodine clamp shields, allowing us to reduce the cost of treatment and to simplify training procedures.","1043":"Peritonitis is still one of the most important complications of peritoneal dialysis. Over the last few years, many efforts have been made in developing new device systems. A remarkable improvement has been obtained by modifying the original connection between the catheter and the bag, especially after the introduction of the Y-set. The aim of this study was to verify whether the use of a new device system, called the T-set, could reduce the incidence of peritonitis. This connector adds the advantages of the Y-set to those of the twin bag. In a group of 53 patients enrolled in a three-year period with a follow-up of 797 patient-months, we observed an incidence of peritonitis of one episode every 50 months. Furthermore, in the subgroup of 39 new patients, we observed an incidence of peritonitis of one episode every 89 patient-months. This new device can be a further step in the evolution of connectors that reduce the incidence of peritonitis.","1044":"This prospective randomized study is an evaluation of efficacy of cefazolin and ofloxacin in 23 end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) who experienced 38 episodes of peritonitis (P). Cefazolin was administered intraperitoneally: 1000 mg as loading dose and 250 mg every exchange as maintenance dose for ten days. Ofloxacin was given orally: first 300 mg, followed by ten daily doses of 200 mg. Microbes most frequently isolated from peritoneal effluent were Staphylococci (coagulase-negative in 55.3%, aureus in 7.9%), Acinetobacter (in 5.3%), Klebsiella (in 5.5%), and Micrococcus (in 5.3%). Used as monotherapy, we found the efficacy of both cefazolin and ofloxacin inadequate for treatment of P in CAPD patients (cefazolin 65%, ofloxacin 67%) (NS).","1045":"The choice of initial antibiotic therapy for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) peritonitis is complex. To test the hypothesis that the initial choice of intraperitoneal antibiotics does not influence the outcome of therapy for CAPD peritonitis, we studied 1930 patients on peritoneal dialysis as of 1 January 1991, and recorded all episodes of peritonitis for one year. There were 1168 episodes of peritonitis for which 64% of the patients received intraperitoneal antibiotics as the first course of treatment. We determined peritonitis resolution, technique failure, hospitalization, and catheter removal rates as measures of successful treatment for peritonitis. Cephalothin, cefazolin, vancomycin, and ceftazidime were used alone or in combination with the aminoglycosides, tobramycin and gentamicin. The mean resolution rate was 65% following the first course of antibiotics and 76% by the third course of antibiotics, if necessary. The antibiotic regimens were not different with respect to resolution rate except when aminoglycosides were used alone. Technique failure was also greater in patients treated with aminoglycosides without other antibiotics. Hospitalizations were increased in patients treated with single drug therapy. If initial intraperitoneal therapy includes treatment for both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, the initial choice of intraperitoneal antibiotics does not influence the outcome of therapy for CAPD peritonitis.","1046":"Various studies have shown that peritoneal dialysis patients may require less erythropoietin (rHuEPO) than maintenance hemodialysis patients. Iron deficiency in hemodialysis patients may contribute to the difference in response. This study compares the response to rHuEPO in 24 patients on CAPD to 33 patients on hemodialysis. All the hemodialysis patients received intravenous iron to prevent iron deficiency. Peritoneal dialysis patients received rHuEPO subcutaneously twice weekly. Erythropoietin was administered intravenously thrice weekly in hemodialysis patients. In peritoneal dialysis patients, hematocrit was 23.1% and 30.1%, rHuEPO dose was 80.9 and 89.0 u\/kg\/wk, while in hemodialysis patients hematocrit was 22.2% and 31.2%, and rHuEPO dosage was 140.2 and 154.3 u\/kg\/wk at initiation, and six months after therapy (p &lt; 0.05 for dose, hemodialysis vs CAPD). Serum iron and transferrin saturation remained normal both in peritoneal and hemodialysis patients. These findings suggest that hemodialysis patients require a higher dosage of rHuEPO than peritoneal dialysis patients for a comparable rise in hematocrit, even when iron deficiency is prevented with parenteral iron. The improved efficacy of rHuEPO in CAPD patients may be due to the better removal of the inhibitors of erythropoiesis and\/or the subcutaneous route of administration.","1047":"There is increasing evidence that erythropoietin (EPO) affects immune function in addition to its well-known effects on the erythrogenesis. However, many of the studies examining the immunomodulatory capacity of this hormone have been in vitro. We examined mRNA signal for three important cytokines, interleukin 1(IL-1), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-alpha), in stable continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients at baseline, and again at 2, 4, and 6 months after treatment with EPO. Significant changes were noted in all three cytokine mRNA signals in the majority of patients treated with this hormone. We conclude that EPO has significant immunomodulatory effects in vivo as defined by changes in cytokine mRNA compared to control. The significance of these changes, and their relationship to well-being and altered immune function remain to be better defined.","1048":"Recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEpo) can be administered to continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients subcutaneously (SC), intravenously (IV), and intraperitoneally (IP). Subcutaneous rHuEpo is preferred in CAPD patients because of its ease of administration and favorable pharmacokinetics. The longer half-life of SC rHuEpo allows for one or two doses per week. Since SC rHuEpo can cause pain and local irritation at the injection site, the efficacy and safety of intramuscular (IM) rHuEpo were compared to SC rHuEpo in 6 random stable CAPD patients. The protocol in each subject consisted of a single weekly injection of IM rHuEpo for 3-6 months (period 1), crossover to SC rHuEpo for 3-6 months (period 2), and crossover to IM rHuEpo for 3-6 months (period 3). The rHuEpo dose was adjusted by protocol to achieve a target hematocrit of 30%-33%. Pain at the injection site was graded on a scale of 0-3. All patients preferred IM rHuEpo to SC rHuEpo because of less pain at the injection site. One patient tolerated IM rHuEpo for six months (period 1), then left the study after one month of SC rHuEpo because of ecchymoses and pain at the SC injection sites. In all patients, there was no significant difference in the dose of rHuEpo (U\/kg\/wk) during the three study periods.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1049":"Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) may not be tolerated by patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) because of increased abdominal pressure in the standing position after instillation of peritoneal fluid. We report, here, a patient with COPD who had marked distress while on CAPD but was more comfortable with supine intermittent peritoneal dialysis. It is probable that the continuous high intraperitoneal pressure during CAPD caused diaphragmatic fatigue. During intermittent peritoneal dialysis, the supine position induces the least increase in intraperitoneal pressure; it may be the preferred mode of peritoneal dialysis for patients with COPD.","1050":"For the diabetic patient on peritoneal dialysis, the intraperitoneal administration of insulin can lead to improvement in glycemic control while eliminating uncomfortable subcutaneous injections. Furthermore, the relatively higher portal vein concentrations of insulin compared to peripheral levels is reminiscent of the physiologic state in which the portal vein carries the insulin secreted by the pancreas. The pharmacokinetics of intraperitoneal insulin depends upon whether the insulin is administered along with the usual volume of dialysis fluid or is given undiluted. This variability has important implications for glycemic control in the patient receiving cycler peritoneal dialysis, particularly if the abdomen is dry for prolonged periods during the day. Recommendations are made based on the known pharmacokinetics of intraperitoneal insulin in both the dry and filled peritoneal cavity.","1051":"Prediction of suitability of patients for tidal peritoneal dialysis (TPD) treatment based on the peritoneal equilibration test (PET) may be hypothetically subject to errors, due to the difference between the long equilibration times of the PET and the short dwell times currently utilized during TPD. Eleven patients, mean age 12.4 +\/- 3.3 years, mean body weight 34.2 +\/- 15kg, had both a standardized TPD run (initial fill volume 40 mL\/kg, tidal volume 50%, dwell time 10 min, treatment time 8 h) and a PET performed. D\/P ratios for creatinine and urea were calculated at the 5th and 7th TPD exchanges (approximating equilibration time of the TPD run), at the time points of the PET and on the total TPD dialysate volume. D\/P ratios for creatinine and urea of the 5th and, even more, the 7th TPD exchange, and D\/P ratios obtained from total TPD dialysate were significantly correlated overall (r = 0.96, p &lt; 0.0001 for 5th D\/P creatinine and urea; r = 0.98, p &lt; 0.0001 for 7th D\/P creatinine and urea). Correlation coefficients between PET-derived and total TPD dialysate-derived D\/P ratios were generally poor or only modest. Thus, it is possible to predict TPD clearance, and consequently the suitability of patients for TPD, knowing the D\/P ratios for creatinine and urea at the 7th TPD exchange of a standardized TPD run. Our data could represent a new reliable test for TPD prescription.","1052":"A computer interaction session conducted during the 14th Annual Peritoneal Dialysis Conference in Orlando, Florida, on January 24, 1994, revealed the preferences and practices of 650-690 respondents voting on questions related to peritoneal catheters. Compared to the surveys conducted in 1987 and 1989, the most striking change was an increase in the use of catheters with the bent intramural segment, particularly the Swan neck catheter, and an increase in the use of catheters with the coiled intraperitoneal segment. The Tenckhoff catheter continued to be the most popular, although its use was decreasing. The remaining catheters were used in small numbers. The vast majority of nephrologists remain convinced of the superiority of double cuff catheters over single cuff ones, and the use of the former continued to exceed 70%. Essentially no change occurred in the method of catheter placement; surgical dissection (72.7%) remained the most popular implantation method. Surgeons were primarily responsible for catheter implantations (87.4% of votes). The use of prophylactic antibiotics prior to catheter implantation seems to be increasing. The majority of respondents did not consider a Staphylococcus aureus nasal carrier status as important in the development of catheter-related infections, as indicated by the small number of centers where routine culture of nares was performed. The majority of institutions delayed ambulatory peritoneal dialysis after catheter implantation, but ambulatory peritoneal dialysis was started in some centers (5.7% of votes) in the immediate postimplantation period.","1053":"This study was designed to compare severity of illness and quality of life variables in chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) and hemodialysis (HD) patients. The patient sample consisted of 63 PD patients (38 male, 25 female; mean age 54.5 years) and 35 HD patients (23 male, 12 female; mean age 54.9 years). Disease severity was greater in in-center HD patients than in PD patients (p &lt; 0.008), although there were no significant differences in functional status as measured by the Karnofsky Index between HD patients (68.6 +\/- 2.3) and PD patients (71.9 +\/- 1.7). While both patient groups reported the same number of overall physical symptoms. HD patients reported significantly greater overall discomfort from symptoms than PD patients (p &lt; 0.008). In terms of psychological adjustment, analyses revealed that 22 PD patients (36.7%) and 9 HD patients (25.7%) were classified as clinically depressed. PD patients reported higher anxiety scores than HD patients (p &lt; 0.02) and lower positive mood scores (p &lt; 0.021). HD patients were more severely ill and appeared to suffer from physical symptomatology to a greater degree than PD patients, although they were not more impaired in terms of functional status. Moreover, HD patients showed better psychological adjustment along several dimensions when compared to PD patients. One reason for this finding may be that PD patients experience greater distress, and isolation due to a lack of social support from similar others and medical staff in comparison to in-center HD patients.","1054":"","1055":"Centers have reported superior growth in children on peritoneal dialysis (PD) as compared to hemodialysis (HD). Many factors may influence this outcome including diet, adequacy of dialysis, and control of metabolic acidosis. The role of insulin-like growth factor-1 (IGF-1) and its bioactivity in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) have been recently examined. Insulin-like growth factor binding protein-3 (IGFBP-3) has been shown to be elevated in ESRD, possibly resulting in inhibition of the bioactivity of IGF-1. Potentially, the removal of IGFBP-3 may improve the bioactivity of IGF-1, with resulting improvement in growth. The molecular weight of IGFBP-3 (30.5 kDa) is in the range of other proteins cleared by PD (e.g., albumin-69 kDa). Therefore, we have analyzed 10 samples of IGFBP-3 in the dialysis effluent of 9 children on peritoneal dialysis, and have found that the mean level +\/- SEM was 0.21 +\/- 0.03 mg\/L, while the 3 analyses of children on standard HD was 0.02 +\/- 0.01 mg\/L. In addition, the effluent of 2 children on a high-efficiency dialyzer had an IGFBP-3 level of 0.45 +\/- 0.25 mg\/L. Even though quite preliminary, these data may suggest another reason for improved growth in children on PD and a potential advantage to high-efficiency HD. Further analysis in a larger population of ESRD patients will be needed in order to confirm these preliminary findings.","1056":"Tumor markers play an important role in the assessment of patients with some types of malignant tumors. We studied the effects of dialysis and transplantation on the serum levels of five tumor markers; alpha-fetoprotein (AFP), carcino-embryonic antigen (CEA), cancer antigen-125 (CA-125), cancer antigen-19.9 (CA-19.9), and prostate specific antigen (PSA). Serum tumor markers were measured in patients who-had been on dialysis treatment or had a renal transplant for at least one month. Four groups of 30 patients each (hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis, renal transplant, and normal controls) were studied. Age and sex distribution were comparable between the dialysis and control groups, but the age was significantly younger in the transplant group. Serum AFP and PSA levels were within normal limits in the dialysis and transplant patients. Serum tumor markers, which were raised in the hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients compared to transplant patients and controls, include: CEA (4.5 +\/- 2.7 and 5.1 +\/- 3.0 vs 1.7 +\/- 1.2 and 2.7 +\/- 1.2, p &lt; 0.001); CA-125 (41.1 +\/- 43.8 and 18.9 +\/- 12.7 vs 13.4 +\/- 5.7 and 6.1 +\/- 4.9, p &lt; 0.001 and p &lt; 0.05); and CA-19.9 (66.0 +\/- 60.4 and 66.2 +\/- 76.5 vs 20.2 +\/- 12.3 and 5.3 +\/- 4.5, p &lt; 0.001). Raised CEA, CA-125, and CA-19.9 levels were detected in 37%, 10%, and 53% of peritoneal dialysis patients and 17%, 27%, and 57% of hemodialysis patients. Although the mean serum CEA, CA-125, and CA-19.9 levels were higher in the transplant patients compared to controls.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1057":"We collected data on 43 stable peritoneal dialysis patients (60 values), all of whom had residual renal function, to determine the dependency of normalized protein catabolic rate (PCRN) on residual renal function as well as dialysis adequacy. All patients were on a stable peritoneal dialysis regimen for at least 4 months (median 8 months, range 4-64 months) and were without peritonitis or other serious infections for at least 6 months prior to data collection. Dialysate creatinine clearance (Ccr) was obtained from 24-hour collections of dialysate. Residual renal function was calculated from the average of the urea and the creatinine clearance from 24-hour urine collections. The normalized protein catabolic rate was calculated using the Randerson method. Using linear regression analysis, PCRN correlated with total weekly Ccr (r = 0.7, p &lt; 0.0005), KT\/V urea (r = 0.5, p &lt; 0.0005), and residual renal function (r = 0.6, p &lt; 0.0005). All patients with residual renal function more than 40 L\/week had a PCRN greater than 1.0 g\/kg\/day. To assure a PCRN of 1.0 g\/kg\/day in all patients, a weekly KT\/V urea of 1.9 and\/or a total weekly Ccr of 79 L was required. These results confirm the important role of residual renal function in dialysis adequacy and elucidates its contribution to the maintenance of the patient's protein intake.","1058":"The optimal way to objectively measure the adequacy of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) therapy remains controversial. It has been suggested that one-third or more of all CAPD patients are presently receiving \"inadequate dialysis\" when dialysis prescriptions are not carefully calculated. To better define the therapy being delivered in a large, freestanding CAPD center, weekly KT\/V urea and creatinine clearance per 1.73 m2 body surface area were measured in 56 of 180 patients randomly selected from our unit in whom dialysis prescriptions were arbitrarily determined by nurses and physicians. In addition, protein catabolic rates and selected clinical outcome criteria were assessed. Weekly KT\/V urea correlated with weekly creatinine clearance (r = 0.50) as well as with the protein catabolic rate (r = 0.45). Patients were arbitrarily divided into three groups based on KT\/V urea measurements. Thirty percent of the patients had weekly KT\/Vs &lt; or = 1.4, 41% had KT\/Vs between 1.5 and 1.8, and 29% had weekly KT\/Vs &gt; or = 1.9. Significant differences were not noted in hospitalization rates, erythropoietin doses, or serum albumin concentrations in patients with KT\/Vs &lt; or = 1.4 and in patients with KT\/Vs &gt; or = 1.9. Peritonitis rates were highest in the patients with KT\/V &gt; or = 1.9. Therefore, in patients randomly selected from our large CAPD center, 30% of the patients had weekly KT\/V urea measurements &lt; or = 1.4. The clinical significance of this finding remains uncertain.","1059":"We have examined the correlations of age with 95 demographic, clinical, and laboratory parameters in a continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) population. Significant inverse correlations were found with lean body mass, dialysate creatinine concentration, serum creatinine concentration, and dialysate creatinine nitrogen output in grams per week; all these findings are compatible with the well-known decrease in muscle mass with aging. Urea nitrogen output in dialysate and urine predicts Kjeldahl nitrogen output in urine and dialysate applying the Randerson equation similarly in older and younger CAPD patients. The relationship of normalized net protein catabolic rate to weekly urea clearance normalized to total body water is similar for older and younger CAPD patients. Older and younger patients have similar values for serum albumin concentration. In conclusion, the findings suggest that comparable weekly creatinine clearances should yield much lower serum creatinine concentrations in older patients. Poor protein intakes in the elderly should not be attributed to age if weekly urea clearances are low. Increases in protein intake in response to increases in urea clearances are similar in older and younger CAPD patients.","1060":"One of the key factors in improving the survival and dropout rate in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients is to improve their nutritional status. In this study 18 CAPD patients were encouraged to add 0.1-0.3 g of protein\/kilogram\/day of high biological value nutrients for more than 6 months in the form of a dessert. Several nutritional parameters, such as serum total protein, albumin, prealbumin, transferrin, plasma total amino acids, the ratio of essential amino acids (EAA) to nonessential amino acids (NEAA), and serum C3, C4, increased significantly. The values of (KT\/V) urea increased simultaneously with increases in the protein catabolic rate (PCR) after the administration of nutrients. There was also a significant correlation between the (KT\/V) urea and PCR in each patient. These results suggest that supplementary protein nutrients can improve the biochemical and physical nutritional parameters that are related to nutritional status and peritoneal functions.","1061":"In uremic patients peritoneal transfer was evaluated at 0-45-minute dwells in exchanges 3-5,9-11, and 15 -17 of single intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD) and compared to effective peritoneal blood flow (EPBF) simultaneously estimated as KBD for CO2 gas using the two-sample model of Garred et al. for a 2.5-minute dwell. During single IPD, a decrease in peritoneal transfer of HCO3-,tCO2,K+, and urea was observed (lower values of transfer in exchanges 15-17 than in exchanges 3-5). With a dialysis solution with pH 7.25, there were higher values of peritoneal clearances (Cp) for CO2 gas during the entire 45-minute dwell compared to respective values obtained with a pH 6.22 solution. Transfer parameters of urea and uric acid were also higher with a dialysis solution with pH 7.25, but there were significant differences only during the first 5-20 minutes of the dwell. All mentioned differences were not dependent on EPBF. Significant correlations between EPBF and peritoneal transfer parameters were shown only for CO2 gas, HCO3-, and tCO2. We consider these findings to be the correlation between the transfer of CO2 gas (not EPBF) and the transfer of other forms of CO2. Our data provide evidence that peritoneal transfer is not limited by changes in EPBF occurring during IPD in clinically stable uremic patients.","1062":"Renal patients are prone to malnutrition. This is of particular concern in patients undergoing peritoneal dialysis because of the loss of protein in the dialysate. Data comparing the adequacy of continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) are few. To compare nutritional status and dialysis adequacy, 32 patients were studied (19 CAPD, 13 CCPD). Weight change, dietary intake, degree of edema, and laboratory parameters (hemoglobin, albumin, urea, creatinine) were assessed. Dialysis efficiency was compared using urea and creatinine kinetics [KT\/V(urea), normalized protein catabolic rate (PCRN), efficacy number, weekly creatinine clearance]. Age was similar in each group [CAPD 56.5 years (34-75 years); CCPD 53.5 years (14-76 years)]. There were no significant differences in hemoglobin, albumin [29 +\/- 1.3 g\/L CAPD; 32 +\/- 1.5 g\/L CCPD (mean +\/- SEM)], urea, or creatinine between groups, nor in KT\/V (1.72 +\/- 0.15 CAPD; 1.93 +\/- 0.17 CCPD) and PCRN (0.79 +\/- 0.05 CAPD; 0.97 +\/- 0.08 CCPD). The efficacy number was significantly higher in the CCPD patients (6.95 +\/- 0.66 CAPD; 9.93 +\/- 1.3 CCPD; p = 0.03). This study indicates that the nutritional status of CCPD patients at our center was similar to that of CAPD patients. Adequacy of dialysis was also similar in CCPD patients as compared with CAPD patients.","1063":"The creatinine generation was measured (GCr) in 132 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients from the product of total daily peritoneal plus renal creatinine clearance and plasma creatinine (CpCr) plus the product of estimated gut clearance of 0.036 L\/kg\/day and CpCr. The creatinine generation was also predicted (PGCr) from gender, age, and weight. The mean ratio of MGCr\/PGCr was 1.29. Analysis of these data suggests that on average, only 78% of the prescribed dialysis is actually delivered in CAPD patients. Further studies are suggested for the verification of the assumed gut creatinine clearance.","1064":"A total of 132 patients from 15 dialysis centers were studied. Analyses were made of each drained dialysate exchange over 24 hours to determine total peritoneal urea clearance (KpT, liters\/day), and a 24-hour urine was collected to determine total renal urea clearance (KrT, liters\/day) and the sum of KpT+KrT or KprT, liters\/day. Body water volume (V, L) was estimated from gender and surface area, and daily fractional urea clearance (KprT\/V) was calculated. Normalized protein catabolic rate (PCRN, grams\/kilogram\/day) was also calculated from the urea data. Major results were the following: KrT comprised 25% of KprT; the mean KprT\/V was 0.28, but ranged from 0.10-0.50; an equivalent thrice-weekly hemodialysis KT\/V was calculated from the KprT\/V values and showed mean KT\/V = 1.07, but 67% of values were less than 1.0. In contrast, the Health Care Finance Administration (HCFA) consensus criteria indicated 91% of prescriptions were adequate. These data indicate the need for clinical outcome studies with KprT\/V randomized over the range 0.20-0.30 to better define the domain of adequate CAPD.","1065":"A clinical pilot study compared predictions of a new model of peritoneal dialysis mass transfer to measured weekly KT\/V urea (KTu\/V) and weekly creatinine clearance (Ccr) in liters per 1.73 m2 in 50 patients from five centers (40 CAPD, 10 CCPD). The Robertson et al. model is unique in that it does not require a 24-hour collection of dialysate. Instead, model predictions are based on the results of a standard 4-hour peritoneal equilibration test (PET) and appropriate demographic data. Analysis revealed 12 collection errors, 8 affecting the PET and 4 affecting 24-hour dialysate volume. PET drainage volume was low in six cases, excessive in two; 24-hour volume was incomplete in three, excessive in one. Similar errors were not found in the remaining 38 patients. In the 38 patients with correctly performed PET and dialysate collections, agreement between predicted and measured values was excellent.","1066":"This study was performed to evaluate the use of the glucose concentration versus glucose absorption in the dialysate to estimate ultrafiltration efficacy. In 26 patients (16 men, 10 women) on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, a total of 128 dwells were investigated. Each dwell lasted 5 hours, using 2 L of peritoneal dialysis fluid containing 140 mmol\/L glucose. After the dwell, the removed peritoneal dialysis fluid was weighted. The concentrations of creatinine and glucose and the total amount of glucose were analyzed. The mean concentration of dialysate glucose for the whole group after a 5-hour dwell was 38.9 +\/- 8.9 (SD) mmol\/L. The ultrafiltration volume was inversely correlated to the glucose absorbed (r = -0.59, p = 0.002), but was not significantly correlated to the glucose concentration in the dialysate (r = 0.40, p = 0.057). The ultrafiltration volume was not related to the creatinine concentration in the dialysate or the body weight. The average dialysate glucose did not change during a one-year observation time. Patients with diabetes mellitus had significantly lower glucose absorption than nondiabetics (p = 0.045), and patients with low ultrafiltration efficacy had significantly greater glucose absorption than those with normal and high ultrafiltration (p = 0.038). There was no difference between those who had those who had not suffered from peritonitis. The results indicate that the glucose absorption from the dialysis fluid is the best parameter to calculate the peritoneal ultrafiltration efficacy and not the glucose concentration currently used.","1067":"Ultrafiltration failure (UFF) is one of the most frequent causes of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) dropout and is a common consequence of peritoneal hyperpermeability secondary to inappropriate regeneration of mesothelial cells. In this paper we present the results of 25 peritoneal resting periods of 4 weeks in 16 patients who showed UFF. The mean duration of CAPD was 44 +\/- 22 months. All patients had been free of peritonitis for at least 3 months when included in the peritoneal resting trial. UFF was always defined as a long-lasting decrease of UF capacity such that dry weight could no longer be achieved by CAPD. The former incidence of peritonitis was 3.9 +\/- 2.3 episodes. Results compared to the preresting data: urea MTC (mass transfer coefficient) decreased from 24.9 +\/- 6.8 to 21.0 +\/- 6.1 (p &lt; 0.05), creatinine MTC from 16.5 +\/- 6.0 to 13.8 +\/- 4.0 (p &lt; 0.05), and UF increased from 493.8 +\/- 278.0 to 881.3 +\/- 388.1 (p &lt; 0.001). The response in terms of UF in patients with low permeability ultrafiltration (creat MTC less than 13) was heterogeneous and lower than in patients with criteria of hyperpermeability (greater than 13): 720 +\/- 396 to 1150 +\/- 533 (NS) versus 491 +\/- 310 to 808 +\/- 205, respectively. Simultaneously, creatinine MTC did not change in the former group (10.2), while hyperpermeability patients showed a remarkable decrease (19 +\/- 5 to 15 +\/- 2, p &lt; 0.05). In conclusion, peritoneal resting is a useful tool in the management of ultrafiltration failure in CAPD patients, primarily in those with peritoneal hyperpermeability.","1068":"To evaluate fluid retention during the long nighttime peritoneal dwell in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, we measured remaining volumes in 70 patients. In only 50% of these patients were more than 2 L of fluid recovered; in 30% between 1.5 and 2 L were recovered; and in 17% of patients we retrieved less than 1.5 L of peritoneal fluid. In 3 of these patients, who were edematous and had marked pitting edema, we shortened the nighttime dwell by having the patients awaken after 4 hours and drain the dwell. This resulted in 3-5 kg of weight loss in each patient, when compared with each patient's previous use of long nighttime dwells. Finally, we propose in this report two automated methods whereby the period of nighttime dialysis can be controlled, while patients sleep, using a system of timer clamps.","1069":"We reviewed 216 patients on peritoneal dialysis over a 3-year period to assess the effects on patient outcome of short-dwell dialysis (SDD), defined as dwell time below 4 hours with a daily dry (empty peritoneum) interval. Forty-nine patients (23%) required SDD for improved management of ultrafiltration failure (82%), effective blood pressure control (8%), abdominal wall hernia (4%), hydrothorax (4%), and patient convenience (2%). Ultrafiltration failure was recognized as the inability to achieve resolution of clinical overhydration, confirmed by the peritoneal equilibration test (PET), demonstrating high membrane glucose transport (absorption) and observed retention of dialysate volume. Daytime ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (DAPD) was used by 69% of patients and nightly peritoneal dialysis (NPD) with cyclers by 31%. Only one patient (hydrothorax) transferred to hemodialysis. Observations include sustained hydration and blood pressure control in all patients with maintenance of biochemical dialysis adequacy, less reliance on very hypertonic solutions, an increase in dry weight in 25% of patients, decreased use of antihypertensive agents, effective management of hernia and hydrothorax in 3 of 4 patients, and satisfactory patient tolerance of DAPD and NPD regimens, and daily dry intervals. Factors promoting SDD include improved understanding of PET studies, use of disconnect systems, and improvement in cycler design. We anticipate increasing use of SDD as recognition of its usefulness and application techniques expands.","1070":"The intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure (IPP) and overall ultrafiltration (UF) volume were measured in 34 patients after a 2-hour exchange with 2 L of dialysate containing 3.86% glucose. These patients had been treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) on average for 26 +\/- 20 months under stable conditions. The patients were at rest during the 2-hour exchange. The normal IPP measured with the patient lying completely flat was on inspiration (IPPinsp) 14 +\/- 4 cm of water (cmH2O) and on expiration (IPPexp) 12 +\/- 3 cm H2O, for an intraperitoneal volume of 2820 +\/- 319 mL. The mean UF was 744 +\/- 323 mL. The mean IPP (IPPmean), defined by (IPPinsp+IPPexp)\/2, had a negative linear correlation to the UF volume (r = 0.66; p = 0.0001). The linear regression test showed that an increase of 1 cm H2O in the IPPmean reduced the overall UF volume by 70 mL in 2 hours. In conclusion, even though the UF is produced by the osmotic pressure of the dialysate, it is also influenced to a great extent by the intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure, which should not be ignored.","1071":"From 1988 to 1992, 114 patients with end-stage renal failure were treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). In 30 patients (18 men, 12 women, age 31-80 years), 40 scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of parietal peritoneal tissue, obtained with biopsy, were performed: in 20 patients at the time of the first catheter implantation, in 14 patients after catheter removal (because of peritonitis in 12 patients and drainage problems in 2 patients), and in 6 patients during catheter reinsertion. In uremic patients two types of mesothelial cells were observed: hexagonal and elongated. In some patients microvilli were abundant and covered the whole surface of mesothelial cells; in other patients microvilli were lacking. Wide openings (stomata) between mesothelial cells were found in some cases, which were wider in patients with peritonitis. During peritonitis, microvilli disappeared, and mesothelial cells were covered with fibrin, leukocytes, and erythrocytes instead. In the majority of patients with peritonitis, mesothelial cells were totally peeled away, or removed, leaving a denuded surface of fibrous tissue. A recovery of the parietal peritoneum was observed in one patient at the time of peritoneal catheter reinsertion: a complete mesothelial regeneration with abundant microvilli appeared. In other patients the surface was denuded, without microvilli or mesothelial cells, covered with fibrin and fibrous tissue. Despite observed changes of the parietal peritoneum with SEM during the course of CAPD and peritonitis, changes may be reversible due to regeneration of mesothelial cells. Prolonged changes after discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis may persist in patients without mesothelial cell regeneration or with a defective process of fibrinolysis.","1072":"The effect of chronic treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on pituitary-adrenal axis responses to stress in patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is not known. The purpose of this study was to assess the influence of rHuEPO treatment on corticotropin (ACTH) levels and cortisol responses to insulin-induced hypoglycemia in CAPD patients. Nine clinically stable and well-nourished patients (age 19-59 years) treated with subcutaneous rHuEPO, 34-208 U\/kg BW\/week, during 6-25 months were studied. Nine patients matched for age, sex, and duration of CAPD and not previously treated with rHuEPO were studied as the control group. Crystalline insulin (0.1 U\/kg BW) was injected IV to the fasting subjects. Blood samples were collected before and 15, 30, 60, 90, and 120 minutes after insulin administration. In all blood samples serum cortisol and glucose concentrations were assessed. There were no statistically significant differences between both groups in hematocrit values and blood hemoglobin concentrations. Insulin administration induced a decrease in glucose levels that reached a nadir at 30 minutes in both groups (1.8 +\/- 0.1 mmol\/L in the rHuEPO group vs 2.1 +\/- 0.2 mmol\/L in the control group). After hypoglycemic stimuli cortisol levels clearly rose in rHuEPO-treated patients reaching a peak of 720 +\/- 71 nmol\/L at 60 minutes. However, in the control group the cortisol peak, which was not different from that observed in the rHuEPO group (676 +\/- 44 nmol\/L), occurred at 90 minutes. The areas under the secretory curve of cortisol did not differ between groups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1073":"Erythropoietin (EPO) given subcutaneously (SC) once per week has been successful in the treatment of anemia in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. We have identified a population of CAPD patients that requires EPO administration once per week or less often. To determine if specific variables could be identified that would predict which CAPD patients would require infrequent EPO dosing, we reviewed the charts of all our CAPD patients who were receiving EPO as of 1 June 1992. Patients had to have been on CAPD for 3 months and EPO for 3 months to be considered for analysis. We identified 12 patients who required EPO once per week or less frequently (infrequent EPO) and 9 patients who required EPO more than once per week (frequent EPO). Parameters that were analyzed included age, gender, race, time on CAPD, history of gastrointestinal bleeding, exit-site infection or peritonitis in the last 60 days, diabetes, amount of dialysate instilled per day, and the number of exchanges per day. Laboratory data that were analyzed included hemoglobin, hematocrit, serum iron, total iron-binding capacity, ferritin, blood urea nitrogen (BUN), creatinine, BUN\/creatinine ratio, albumin, total protein, parathyroid hormone, and aluminum. Categorical data were analyzed via chi-square, and numerical data were analyzed via the t-test. The infrequent EPO group required only 35% as much EPO as the frequent group to maintain hemoglobin and hematocrit, which were significantly greater. The only parameter that was different between the two groups was age (infrequent EPO 42 +\/- 13.2 vs frequent EPO 55.8 +\/- 11.9 years, p &lt; 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1074":"Genital swelling is a common complication in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. It is generally caused by patent processus vaginalis. Sometimes peritoneal damage leads to edema shortly after the insertion of a CAPD catheter. The present paper describes peritoneal damage after one year of dialysis using a single (Toronto Western Hospital II pediatric) catheter due to erosion. A 2-year-old boy was admitted to the hospital with severe scrotal edema. Exploration of both inguinal regions showed no patent processus vaginalis. At laparotomy a 1 x 1-cm perforation was found at the back of the bladder, where the tip of the catheter was located. After closing the perforation and repositioning the CAPD catheter, the symptoms disappeared within 2 days; CAPD treatment was not interrupted. Peritoneal laceration is described as a cause of bowel perforation in CAPD patients. This case history shows that it may be the cause of genital swelling as well. The presence of the disks of the catheter may have contributed to this unknown complication.","1075":"The interruption of chronic peritoneal dialysis for a period of time is recommended for replacement of the peritoneal catheter due to tunnel infection and\/or relapsing peritonitis. In pediatric patients, in the younger ones, in particular, discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis can be problematic--there are difficulties associated with vascular access and hemodialysis. Over a 5-year period 9 children (4 infants, 2 preschool, 3 school-age) required 15 peritoneal access device replacements, without interruption of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The reasons for catheter replacement were tunnel complications (10), relapsing bacterial peritonitis (3), and fungal peritonitis (2). All catheter removals and placements were performed by surgical method under general anesthesia in a one-step procedure. The new catheters were implanted on the opposite side of the abdominal wall in all except one child, who had a colostomy. All patients received prophylactic antibiotics in the bags. In the postoperative period the patients infused smaller exchange volumes during 2 weeks. In the older children the exchange volumes were increased overnight. This schedule resulted in low intra-abdominal pressure. No patient required interval hemodialysis. Relapse of tunnel infection occurred in one episode in the first 2 months. We did not observe, in the same period, recurrence of peritonitis. One-step catheter replacement has been demonstrated to be safe; it avoids the disruption of ongoing treatment and promotes patient maintenance on CAPD.","1076":"Exit-site infection (ESI) in children on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is a complication observed mainly in obese patients and patients wearing diapers. From 15 December 1991 to 28 February 1993, five Swan neck presternal catheters (SNPCs) were implanted in 5 children aged 2-11 years. The criteria for insertion of a SNPC were the following: young age in 1 child, obesity in 2, recurrent ESI in 2, and the use of diapers in 2. In some patients there was more than one criterion. The observation period ranged from 1-10 months, and the time on CAPD with the SNPC was 1-9 months. During this period, we did not observe any catheter-related problems. The potential advantages of the chest location of the catheter exit site are the following: 1. easy exit-site care; 2. decreased risk of ESI in small children because of greater distance from wet diapers; 3. avoidance of trauma with crawling\/creeping; and 4. better healing and decreased risk of ESI in the area with less fat thickness.","1077":"Due to the potential atherogenic effects of oxidized low-density lipoproteins (LDLs), LDL oxidation was studied in a group of uremic patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis. The results were compared with those obtained in a group of 70 controls, 10 uremic patients on predialytic conservative therapy, and 11 patients on repetitive hemodialysis. LDL oxidation was evaluated in all subjects as the susceptibility to in vitro oxidation (monitoring the resistance to Cu(2+)-induced formation of conjugated dienes, lag-phase minutes) and the presence of plasma antioxidized LDL antibodies, expressed as the ratio anti-ox-LDL\/antinative LDL antibodies. Vitamin E (main antioxidant agent) content in LDLs was also measured and the lipid profile studied. No significant changes in vitamin E concentration were found, although LDLs from uremic patients appeared more susceptible to in vitro and in vivo oxidation (as demonstrated by an earlier production of conjugated dienes and by the presence of a higher antibody ratio), as compared to control subjects. Analysis of the different groups of uremic patients revealed that peritoneal dialysis, not hemodialysis, significantly ameliorated the oxidation markers. However, prolonged treatment with peritoneal dialysis caused a decrease in vitamin E concentration in LDLs and increased their susceptibility to oxidation.","1078":"Commercial heat-sterilized fluids for peritoneal dialysis (PD) are unphysiological due to low pH, high osmolality, and the presence of several toxic glucose degradation products, formed during heat sterilization. These properties are all believed to negatively affect host defense in patients. Both the low pH and the high osmolality are known to equilibrate after being introduced into the abdominal cavity of patients. Cytotoxicity due to glucose degradation products has, however, not yet been studied in this respect. Effluent peritoneal dialysates were collected from patients after dwell times of 0, 5, 15, 30, 120, and 240 minutes. Cytotoxicity, measured as the inhibition of cell growth of a cultured fibroblast cell line (L929), osmolality, and pH were determined. PD fluids, due to the presence of degradation products, were found to remain cytotoxic after a dwell time of more than 30 minutes. However, after 4 hours no cytotoxicity could be observed in the effluent fluids. Osmolality slowly decreased during the entire dialysis period, while pH rapidly increased and was close to neutral within 5 minutes following instillation. It is concluded that the presence of glucose degradation in PD fluids may be as important as low pH and high osmolality for clinical complications.","1079":"Chemotaxis and phagocytosis are important functions of phagocytic cells, which are closely related to cytoskeletal reorganization. These functions may be abnormal in phagocytes of uremic patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). In order to examine whether these abnormalities result from treatment, we studied actin polymerization (AP), as an index of cytoskeletal alterations, chemotaxis, and phagocytosis in polymorphonuclear neutrophils (PMNs) of healthy subjects. Polymorphonuclear neutrophils were exposed to either a hepes buffer or a glucose-based dialysis solution (GBDS) of different pH's (5.2, 7.4) and different glucose concentrations (1.36%, 2.27%, 3.86%). After incubation for 0, 5, or 20 minutes, cells were activated with 10 nmol\/L C5a-complement. AP was measured as filamentous (F) actin content by NBD phallacidin staining and FACS analysis. Chemotaxis of PMNs was measured in Boyden chambers. In addition, phagocytosis of zymosan particles was assessed. Prior exposure to GBDS pH 5.2 of each glucose concentration immediately and completely inhibited AP in response to 10 nmol\/L C5a-complement, reduced chemotaxis (&gt; 95%), and completely inhibited phagocytosis. The inhibition was pH-dependent, since GBDS pH 7.4 caused less inhibition of these functions. We conclude that glucose-based dialysis solutions are cytotoxic towards neutrophils and completely inhibit their ability to display responses requiring cytoskeletal reorganization.","1080":"Preliminary evidence of muscarinic acetylcholine receptors (AchRs) in rabbit and human peritoneal mesothelial cells grown in tissue culture is reported. Atropine displaceable binding of L-quinuclidinyl[phenyl-4-3H]-benzilate (QNB), an antagonist that binds to all AchR subtypes, and [N-methyl-3H]-4-diphenylacetoxy-N-methyl-piperidine methiodide (4-DAMP), an antagonist specific for AchR subtypes 1 and 3, to homogenates of mesothelial cells was approximately 400 and 120 fmol ligand bound\/milligram cell protein, respectively. A similar value for specific [3H]-QNB binding was observed in living cells exposed to ligand and atropine for 1 hour at 37C. Guanosine 5'-triphosphate (GTP)-binding proteins measured as beta,gamma-imido[8-3H] guanosine 5'-triphosphate binding to mesothelial cell membranes was approximately 9 pmol\/mg cell protein. Our finding of both muscarinic receptors and GTP-binding proteins in mesothelial cells suggests first, the presence of a functional muscarinic receptor system(s) in peritoneal mesothelial cells, and second, the potential susceptibility of these cells to direct pharmacological manipulation by muscarinic drugs.","1081":"The relationship between the osmotic reflection coefficient for the peritoneal membrane and that for peritoneal capillaries was derived theoretically using a distributed model of peritoneal transport. The distributed model predicted that the osmotic reflection coefficient for the peritoneal membrane was equal to that for peritoneal capillaries only when the capillary wall was the dominant diffusive solute transport resistance. Under these conditions, moreover, all peritoneal capillaries equally contributed to transperitoneal ultrafiltration. If, on the other hand, interstitial tissue was the dominant diffusive solute transport resistance, then the osmotic reflection coefficient for the peritoneal membrane was lower than that for peritoneal capillaries and only superficial capillaries participated in transperitoneal ultrafiltration. Previous experiments have demonstrated that the capillary wall is not the dominant diffusive solute transport resistance for small osmotic solutes across the peritoneal membrane; thus osmotic reflection coefficients for the peritoneal membrane are likely several times less than those for peritoneal capillaries.","1082":"The average free choline level was determined to be 14 mumol\/L in peritoneal dialysates and 22 mumol\/L in the plasma of 30 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Daily choline loss via dialysate averaged 129 mumol with 32 mumol choline lost per dwell. Daily choline loss via the dialysate was positively correlated with plasma choline concentrations. Choline levels in dialysate during CAPD exceed plasma levels of choline 9 mumol\/L in healthy individuals.","1083":"We performed a cross sectional study of our continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients (n = 98) to examine the relation between parameters of adequacy of dialysis [KT\/V, weekly creatinine clearance (Ccr)], urea kinetics (PCR), biochemical parameters (serum albumin), and clinical status of these patients. We also investigated the predictive value of these parameters in the determination of clinical outcomes. The clinical status of each patient was assessed by patient self-assessment and objectively by physicians and nurses. On this basis a total clinical assessment score was assigned. Individuals with a score of 3 or less were judged to be clinically stable (group 1, n = 61), while a score of 4 or more was considered \"not doing well\" (group 2, n = 37). A good correlation (r = 0.7) between subjective and objective assessments was observed. No correlation between total clinical assessment score and KT\/V, PCRN (normalized protein catabolic rate), or Ccr was obtained, while serum albumin levels correlated inversely (r = -0.30; p &lt; 0.003), suggesting that parameters of dialysis adequacy (weekly KT\/V, Ccr) and urea kinetics (PCRN) are not predictive of clinical outcome in CAPD patients, in contrast with hemodialysis (HD) patients. Serum albumin levels were observed to be correlated with clinical outcome in CAPD patients. Hypoalbuminemia was observed in group 2 patients, despite statistically insignificant different values of KT\/V, Ccr, and PCRN in the two groups. Therefore, clinical assessment and parameters such as serum albumin must be considered when determining the total well-being of CAPD patients.","1084":"Diabetic control in 110 diabetics (39 type I and 71 type II), who had been on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for at least 3 months, was considered good (group G, n = 63) or poor (group P, n = 47) if &gt; 50% or &lt; or = 50% of glucose measurements, respectively, were within 3.3-11.1 mmol\/L. Compared to group P, group G had more type I diabetics and fewer type II diabetics; higher serum cholesterol and lower serum creatinine; higher rates of blindness, autonomic neuropathy, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accidents and extremity gangrene; higher annual rates of peritonitis (1.47 +\/- 1.31 vs 0.98 +\/- 1.19 episodes\/patient-year), exit-site\/tunnel infection (0.83 +\/- 1.14 vs 0.39 +\/- 0.68 episodes\/patient-year), and catheter loss (0.81 +\/- 0.59 vs 0.39 +\/- 0.52 episodes\/patient-year); and longer hospitalization (38 +\/- 31 vs 14 +\/- 15 days yearly). All differences were significant at p = 0.05 or lower. According to life-table analysis, median patient survival was 25 +\/- 3 months in group P and 85 +\/- 17 months in group G (p &lt; 0.0001). Technique survival was 14 +\/- 2 months for group P and 28 +\/- 4 months for group G (p &lt; 0.0001). Good diabetic control in diabetics on CAPD is associated with better outcome and constitutes, therefore, a desirable therapeutic goal.","1085":"Increased incidence of cardiovascular morbidity and mortality has been observed in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Hyperlipemia is an important etiologic factor in the pathogenesis of coronary artery disease. Lovastatin has been shown to effectively lower both the serum total cholesterol and triglyceride levels, the most common abnormalities in these patients. In a retrospective study we assessed the lipid-lowering effects of lovastatin (20 mg\/day) in 8 CAPD patients whose serum cholesterol and\/or triglycerides remained greater than 240 mg\/dL, despite a low cholesterol diet. At 6 months of lovastatin therapy, moderate reductions in total cholesterol and triglyceride levels were observed in 2 patients. Although 20 mg\/day of lovastatin were well tolerated, the treatment was not universally effective in lowering the serum cholesterol and triglyceride levels.","1086":"A 42-year-old female patient on hemodialysis (HD) developed S. aureus endocarditis of her aortic and mitral valves following the unsuccessful antibiotic treatment of an infected vascular access. She required aortic valve replacement and repair of her mitral valve. She had been receiving HD 2-3 times per week using a standard dialysate bath. Three and one-half weeks postoperatively she developed hypercalcemia with the following peak values: total calcium (t-Ca), 13.7 mg\/dL; ionized calcium (i-Ca), 1.76 mmol\/L. Hemodynamic instability necessitated switching from HD to peritoneal dialysis (PD). Following 48 hours of unsuccessful treatment of hypercalcemia using Baxter 2.5 mEq\/L Dianeal, zero calcium dialysate prepared by our in-hospital pharmacy was used for cycler PD. Four days later the t-Ca was 10.6 mg\/dL, and i-Ca was 1.32 mmol\/L. Thereafter, 2.5 mEq\/L calcium Dianeal was resumed. When hypercalcemia recurred (t-Ca 12.0 mg\/dL and i-Ca 1.76 mmol\/L), repeat use of zero calcium dialysate returned the patient's calcium values to within normal limits (t-Ca 9.0 mg\/dL, i-Ca 1.20 mmol\/L) by 7 days posttreatment. The results in this patient demonstrate that in-hospital pharmacies can conveniently prepare prescription-ordered dialysate and that zero calcium dialysate is yet an additional modality available to correct hypercalcemia in PD patients.","1087":"Peritoneal dialysate containing 2.5 mEq\/L of calcium has been used to prevent hypercalcemia when calcium-containing phosphate binders are given. However, worsening of hyperparathyroidism may result. Calcitriol used in conjunction with 2.5 mEq\/L calcium dialysate is an attractive alternative, but has not been examined in a controlled trial. Eighteen patients were randomly assigned to either a control group (3.5 mEq\/L calcium dialysate without calcitriol) or a study group (conversion to 2.5 mEq\/L calcium dialysate with oral calcitriol, median dose 0.25 microgram\/day). The initial mean serum calcium (9.9 vs 9.6 mg\/dL), phosphate (5.4 vs 5.6 mg\/dL), median n-terminal parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels (71 vs 55 pg\/mL, normal &lt; 25), and median 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D levels (4 vs 5 pg\/mL, normal 15-60 pg\/mL) were not different in the two groups. After 8 weeks the serum calcium and phosphate were unchanged from baseline in both groups. The 9 patients who converted to 2.5 mEq\/L calcium dialysate had an insignificant fall in the PTH level, not different from the control group. The median 1,25 (OH)2 vitamin D level rose from 4 to 23 pg\/mL (p = 0.003) on calcitriol, but remained unchanged in the control group (5 pg\/mL). The median doses of oral calcium (0.9 vs 1.1 g\/day) and the frequency of serum calcium levels greater than 11 mg\/dL (4\/9 vs 3\/9 patients, 10% vs 8% of all values) were similar in the study and control groups.

The infused ionized and total calcium were, respectively, 1.28 +\/- 0.04 and 1.77 +\/- 0.04 mmol\/L with 1.75 Ca and 0.89 +\/- 0.03 and 1.28 +\/- 0.04 mmol\/L with 1.25 Ca solutions. During CaMT studies, the ultrafiltration rate was 250 mL on average, and serum iCa 1.24 mmol\/L. Calcium was gained by the patients (+0.41 +\/- 0.6 mmol\/L) using standard solutions. CaMT was -0.67 +\/- 0.4 mmol\/L with 1.25 Ca and -2.4 +\/- 0.4 mmol\/L with zero Ca solutions. Throughout the exchanges the D\/P ratio for iCa decreased from 0.97 +\/- 0.03 at 0 minutes to an equilibrium value (at about 240 minutes) of 0.84 +\/- 0.03 with 1.75 Ca solutions, while it increased from 0.75 +\/- 0.04 to 0.83 +\/- 0.05 with 1.25 Ca solutions. After a 6-hour exchange with zero Ca, the D\/P ratio for iCa was 0.76 +\/- 0.04, significantly lower than the D\/P ratio for urea (0.97 +\/- 0.02), creatinine (0.89 +\/- 0.06), and bicarbonate (0.98 +\/- 0.02). In conclusion, dialysate and serum iCa are in equilibrium at a D\/P ratio of about 0.84. Thus calcium is gained by the patients using 1.75 Ca solutions, and it is lost (both by diffusion and ultrafiltration) using 1.25 Ca solutions.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1089":"Dialysate containing 1.25 mmol\/L calcium and 2.5 g\/dL dextrose has been shown to have a negative calcium mass transfer (CMT) in a 4-hour exchange. Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients usually perform three daytime exchanges that have short dwell times and one overnight exchange that dwells for 8-10 hours. Measurement of CMT with a 10-hour overnight CAPD exchange has not been done. Thirty-four CMT measurements were performed on 18 patients using 1.25 (n = 15) and 1.75 mmol\/L (n = 19) calcium dialysate, both containing 2.5 g\/dL dextrose, with a dwell time of 10 hours. The mean CMT values were -0.75 +\/- 0.45 and 0.42 +\/- 0.54 mmol\/exchange for 1.25 and 1.75 mmol\/L calcium dialysate, respectively (p &lt; 0.001). The serum ionized calcium levels were similar in the two groups, 1.2 mmol\/L. With multivariate analysis the CMT values had a negative correlation with drain volumes (r = -0.5, p = 0.0001) and serum-ionized calcium (r = -0.4, p = 0.002). In conclusion, the CMT of an overnight exchange using 2.5 g\/dL dextrose is determined by the initial dialysate calcium, the ultrafiltration volume, and the serum-ionized calcium. An overnight dwell using 1.25 mmol\/L calcium dialysate will contribute to negative calcium balance, allowing larger doses of oral calcium compounds to be prescribed.","1090":"Pulse vitamin D3 (3-5 micrograms po, twice a week) has been proposed for individuals with hyperparathyroidism resistant to daily po vitamin D3 therapy. While pulse vitamin D3 is effective, concerns regarding oversuppression of parathyroid hormone (PTH) values leading to adynamic bone disease have arisen. In view of these concerns, minibolus vitamin D3 po therapy was utilized in dosages varying from 0.25-1.0 micrograms twice a week in an effort to control elevated PTH values in patients who failed standard daily vitamin D3 therapy. Eleven patients were changed to minibolus vitamin D3 therapy from standard daily treatment (6 women, 5 men; mean age 55.8 +\/- 14 years), on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for an average of 28.4 +\/- 23 months. The mean intact PTH (iPTH) values on 0.25 microgram\/day decreased by 54.5 +\/- 167.8 pg\/mL compared to pretreatment values. The mean iPTH on minibolus vitamin D3 therapy decreased by 165.1 +\/- 104 pg\/mL. The response to minibolus vitamin D3 was not truly predicted by the baseline PTH values. While the average decrease in PTH was greatest on 1.0 microgram two times a week, 2 patients experienced a decrease greater than 200 pg\/mL in PTH on a lower dose. The greatest effect on PTH with minipulse vitamin D3 occurred when iPTH was &lt; or = 500 pg\/mL. While total calcium increased on daily vitamin D3, there was no significant change with minipulse therapy.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1091":"This study was undertaken to evaluate high-dose intravenous (IV) calcitriol therapy in chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients. Nine stable chronic PD patients (7 male, 2 female, mean age 54 years) with secondary hyperparathyroidism and a mean duration of PD of 33 months, were studied for 6 months. Pulse calcitriol was administered IV in dosages of 4-8 micrograms every 2 weeks. Eight patients received oral calcitriol prior to IV pulse. Five patients were on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, and 4 patients were on continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis. Seven patients were on low-calcium dialysate (2.5 mEq\/L) and 2 on high-calcium dialysate (3.5 mEq\/L). All patients received calcium acetate or calcium carbonate to control hyperphosphatemia during the study. Mean serum parathyroid hormone N-terminal (PTHN) levels (35.4 +\/- 9.5 pg\/mL) decreased significantly from premean serum PTHN levels (79.7 +\/- 10.4 pg\/mL). No significant changes were observed in premean serum total calcium, ionized calcium, and phosphorus levels and posttherapy levels. No correlation was observed between serum PTHN and serum calcium, 1,25(OH)2D3, serum aluminum, and duration of dialysis. No significant difference in total body calcium and total body bone mineral density (BMD) was observed between pre and post study periods. In conclusion, biweekly IV calcitriol therapy is effective in suppressing secondary hyperparathyroidism in PD patients.","1092":"Hyperparathyroidism remains a cause of significant morbidity in dialysis patients. We studied pulse oral calcitriol, 5.0 micrograms biweekly to control hyperparathyroidism in 12 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Parathyroid hormone (PTH) levels fell, while calcium and phosphorus levels remained in good control. Pulse oral calcitriol is an effective therapy for hyperparathyroidism in CAPD patients.","1093":"Recognition of the harmful effects of aluminum, its replacement by calcium salts, the introduction of reduced calcium dialysis fluid, and the availability of sensitive and specific assays for intact 1-84PTH have resulted in changes in the monitoring and management of renal osteodystrophy in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). In addition, better understanding of the calcitriol\/parathyroid axis enables a more structured approach to the treatment of patients with established hyperparathyroid bone disease. Wherever possible, CAPD patients should undergo tetracycline labeled bone biopsy at the time of starting dialysis in order to establish the exact bone histology. Thereafter management can be rationally decided on the basis of regular monitoring of serum intact parathyroid hormone (iPTH). Routine prophylactic use of calcitriol is unnecessary, but when iPTH levels rise, despite strict control of calcium and phosphate levels, oral pulse therapy is an effective and inexpensive method of controlling hyperparathyroidism. However, long-term histological studies of its benefit are awaited.","1094":"We review our experience with hypertonic saline compress therapy in 17 patients with complicated peritoneal dialysis catheter exit-site infections (ESIs). Compresses consisted of exit-site application of 4-5 gauze pads soaked with warm 3% saline for 5-10 minutes, three times daily, for 2-4 weeks, followed by once-daily use thereafter. The mechanism of action involves inhibition of bacterial growth by a hypertonic medium. Eleven patients with cultures positive for Staphylococcus aureus or Pseudomonas were treated with local exist-site measures (cleansers, antiseptics, antibiotic ointments). Therapy, which included multiple courses of systemic antibiotics, failed in 8 patients; in 3 patients, who were intolerant to antibiotics, ESI remained unresolved after local care only. Six patients with culture-negative ESIs received no systemic antibiotics and were unimproved following local therapy. Factors associated with therapy failure included malnutrition, diabetes, obesity, and dermal sensitization and injury associated with prolonged topical agent use. Following hypertonic saline compress therapy, we observed resolution of ESI in all patients without recurrence for follow-up intervals of 3-12 months (mean 6.5 months). Advantages of this therapy include excellent patient acceptance, ease of use, lack of adverse effects on exit site, adjacent skin, catheter or systemic reaction, and minimal expense. Future potential applications include routine daily use for infection prophylaxis and as therapy combined with antibiotics for established ESIs.","1095":"Catheter-related infections (CRIs) have become a prominent morbidity factor in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). To confirm a clinical impression that CRI rates in our population (n = 80, 1080 patient-months) were unusually high, a retrospective study was performed. In addition, data from adult patients treated for at least 12 months were analyzed (n = 28, 325 patient-months) to determine if climate conditions could account for our findings. Comparisons were made between CRI rates during months with a mean maximal temperature of 32 degrees C or higher (hot season) and CRI rates during months with a mean temperature lower than 28 degrees C (control season). Two-cuff Tenckhoff catheters were used on 68 occasions and the Swan neck Missouri catheter 2 on 20 occasions. Main CAPD systems were the O-set (n = 48) and the disposable Y-set (n = 35). A total of 139 CRI episodes were recorded with a rate of 1\/8 patient-months. A CRI was implicated as a causative factor in 18 of 69 episodes of peritonitis (26%) and in 13 of 27 catheter losses (48%). CRI rates were similar when comparing either Swan neck versus Tenckhoff catheters (1\/7 and 1\/8 patient-months) or the O-set versus disposable Y-set (1\/7 and 1\/10 patient-months). Most importantly, a significantly higher incidence of CRI was found during the hot seasons in comparison to the control seasons (1\/9 vs 1\/19 patient-months, p &lt; 0.05, one-way signed rank test). Our data suggest that a hot climate can adversely affect the rate of CRIs.","1096":"Much is known about leaks on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), but little is known about peritoneal dialysis-related infection associated with leaks. All catheter infections and peritonitis associated with leaks in established CAPD\/CCPD (continuous cyclic peritoneal dialysis) patients occurring between 1979 and 1 July, 1992 were reviewed. Seventy-nine leaks occurred in 66 patients involving 76 catheters. Prophylactic antibiotics were given for all leaks. Thirty-three (42%) of the leaks were associated with an infection, and 46 (58%) were not. Patient sex, age, race, insulin dependence, and renal transplant within 60 days of leak were not different among patients with infection-associated leaks and those with leaks without infection. The median time on peritoneal dialysis prior to the leak was shorter in patients without an associated infection than in those with an associated infection (1.9 vs 5.6 months, p = 0.03). More catheters were removed in the infection-associated group (17\/33, 52% vs 11\/43, 26%, p = 0.03). Infection preceded leaks by a median of 20 days in 22\/33 and was followed by leaks in a median of 14 days in 11\/33 leaks. More of the catheters with a preceding infection were removed (14\/22, 64% vs 3\/11, 27%, p = 0.05). Infections occurring after a leak were often polymicrobial (5\/7 catheter infections and 2\/4 peritonitis episodes), while those occurring before a leak were single-organism infections (21\/22). Catheter infections and peritonitis followed by a leak often lead to catheter loss and probably indicate infection of the catheter's deep cuff. Infections following leaks often resolve and are likely secondary, rather than primary infections.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1097":"Breaking-in after catheter implantation may be an important factor in the development of early catheter-related infections in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. We carried out a prospective study comparing two break-in techniques after catheter implantation. All patients entering the CAPD program from March 1991 to December 1992 were enrolled into the study. Data on diabetes mellitus status, Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage, and peritoneal dialysis-related infections were gathered. After catheter implantation, the patients were assigned to either have their catheter rested until the fourteenth postoperative day (group 1) or immediate use of the catheter for intermittent peritoneal dialysis (group 2). Exit-site care was identical for both groups. A total of 32 patients in group 1 and 74 in group 2 were studied. Age, sex, and S. aureus nasal carriage were not significantly different between the two groups. There were more patients with diabetes mellitus in group 2. Four patients in group 2 dropped out of the CAPD program because of refractory peritonitis. There was no significant difference in the number of exit-site infections between groups 1 and 2. There were more patients who had pericatheter leakage and catheter migration in group 2 compared to group 1, although the difference was not statistically significant.","1098":"Intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure (IPP) was measured in 10 patients for 15 days (until day 15) following peritoneal catheter implantation. Tenckhoff catheters were surgically implanted using a transrectal approach. The patients began peritoneal dialysis (PD) immediately, initially with small intraperitoneal fluid volumes (500 mL), gradually increasing to reach 2000 mL by day 7. In one patient PD was delayed until day 7 because of an initial leakage of dialysate. Inspiratory and expiratory IPP were measured daily, with the zero point fixed at the midaxillary line with the patient in the supine position. Despite the small intraperitoneal fluid volumes used initially (500 mL), IPP was much higher in the first 3 days following implantation than in the next 12 days (17 +\/- 3 cm of water vs 11 +\/- 1 cm of water). IPP remained high until day 3, then gradually decreased in a linear fashion until day 12, despite the increased intraperitoneal volumes used, and then remained constant. In conclusion, IPP was found to be significantly higher for 3 days following intraperitoneal catheter implantation, whichever intraperitoneal volume was used. This may be due to tense abdominal muscles from pain caused by the surgery or because of reduced intraperitoneal compliance at the beginning of PD.","1099":"Exit-site infections (ESI) and\/or tunnel infections (TI) are common causes of peritoneal catheter loss. Catheter-related infection can be characterized by ultrasonographic examination (UE) of the exit site and the tunnel. This study was done to determine if the UE is useful in predicting catheter loss. Records from 1990 to 1992 of all continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients with an ESI or TI who had an UE performed were reviewed for causative organism, loss of catheter, and infection resolution. ESI was defined as redness or induration of exit site with or without the presence of drainage. TI was defined as induration or redness along tunnel or incision site with or without the presence of drainage. The presence of a pericatheter sonolucent fluid collection was considered a positive (+) UE, and the absence of fluid a negative (-) UE. Eleven CAPD patients had 12 UE performed within a week of starting antibiotic therapy. Ten were (+) and 2 (-); 7 catheters were removed, all with (+) UE. Of those removed, 6 were due to S. aureus, and 1 due to mycobacterial infection. Of the 3 (+) catheters not removed, 2 infections resolved clinically: both reverted to (-) UE after treatment. We conclude that a (+) UE is a useful predictor of catheter loss.","1100":"We have developed a new method for the displacement of the Swan neck straight (SNS) catheter and have named it the \"alpha replacement method.\" The procedure is to insert a 1.5 mm flexible metal guide wire into the transfer tube, passing it through the catheter tip until it touches the mesenterium. Continued gentle pressure will cause the guide wire to make a big loop in the abdomen, and as the loop increases in size, the catheter will move into the minor pelvic space. The guide wire is pulled out by pressing down on the lower abdomen, and the catheter remains in the minor pelvic space. The procedure is then complete. The alpha replacement method was successful in all 8 patients, with the manipulation time being about 15 minutes. No complications have occurred.","1101":"While the current Tenckhoff catheter is generally successful, outflow failure due to omental obstruction, pericatheter hernias, pericatheter leaks, and exit infections remains a major cause for dropout from peritoneal dialysis therapy. Further, the irregular outflow characteristics of the catheter make highflow automated dialysis problematic. We have developed a catheter with a thin transabdominal tube connecting in a T-shape to a transverse cylinder resting against the parietal peritoneum, with flutes (grooves) as ports. The catheter can be inserted through the 3-mm diameter Quill guide of the Y-TEC peritoneoscopic system. Studies in normal dogs indicated that the T-fluted catheter allowed daily exchanges with 2 L of peritoneal dialysate without outflow obstruction, and peritoneoscopic inspection 2-4 weeks later showed no omental attachment to the grooved ports. By comparison, curled Tenckhoff catheters uniformly developed omental obstruction within 2-4 days, and all such catheters had firm omental attachment to the side holes. Five T-fluted catheters have been placed in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients who had prior complications with Tenckhoff catheters (infections, leaks, and outflow failure). One patient with multiple intraperitoneal adhesions developed outflow failure of the T-fluted catheter, similar to a prior Tenckhoff catheter. All other T-fluted catheters had consistent outflow rates and no complications. In long-term use the T-fluted catheter should prevent omental attachment, deep cuff extrusion, pericatheter hernias, subcutaneous cuff erosion, and exit-site infection, although this is not yet proven.","1102":"To determine factors that lead to successful healing, the results of catheter placement were collected by retrospective chart review in 103 peritoneal dialysis patients between January 1988 and March 1992. There were a total of 112 catheter insertions. A healing time of less than 2 weeks was defined as an optimal outcome. Data were analyzed using contingency tables. Strong predictors of early and effective healing were the following: exit site size less than 0.7 cm, the use of a tunneler to create the exit site, the use of Swan neck catheters, immobilization using Viasorb dressings, and postoperative prophylaxis with intravenous vancomycin. Dialysate leak and the development of hematomas significantly delayed healing. Leaking was associated with early use of the catheter for peritoneal dialysis. Hematoma formation was associated with the use of a tunneler. Uremic or nutritional status, diabetes, immunosuppressive agents, or HIV-positive did not affect catheter healing. Careful attention to intraoperative and postoperative factors optimizes healing independent of complications of primary disease processes in peritoneal dialysis patients.","1103":"We present the long-term results of a protocol of empirical monotherapy of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD)-related peritonitis with ciprofloxacin. One hundred and fifteen episodes of peritonitis were studied. The treatment protocol included 5 days of intraperitoneal (IP) administration of the drug, followed by 10 days of oral therapy. A good clinical response was obtained in 83% of the cases, while treatment failure was observed in 4% and relapse in 7%. A decrease in the sensitivity to ciprofloxacin of the peritonitis agents was observed in the study, with Staphylococcus spp. in particular. Three episodes of peritonitis due to bacteria resistant in vitro to ciprofloxacin responded to the treatment protocol. Ciprofloxacin attained good plasma levels both after oral and IP administration. However, dialysate levels were poor after oral administration. The most frequent side effect was gastric intolerance to oral ciprofloxacin. Two patients experienced severe adverse reactions to the drug. Ciprofloxacin may be a good choice for empirical monotherapy of CAPD-related peritonitis. However, the emergence of bacterial resistances must be carefully monitored. The drug should be administered intraperitoneally, at least to induce remission of the infection. Side effects are not frequent, but ciprofloxacin should not be considered an innocuous drug.","1104":"This study tested the effect of L-2-oxothiazolidine-4-carboxylate (procysteine), a precursor of the intracellular cysteine, on the function of human mesothelial cells (HMCs) in in vitro culture. Procysteine stimulated the proliferation of HMCs and decreased the spontaneous death rate of these cells. HMCs pretreated with procysteine were resistant to injury by free radicals. Procysteine also reversed the cytotoxic effects of a mixture of essential and nonessential amino acids on HMCs, such as increased susceptibility to injury by free radicals and inhibition of proliferation.","1105":"Pseudomonas peritonitis in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) can be difficult to eradicate, because it is frequently resistant to common antibiotics, inducing the loss of the peritoneal cavity in some cases. A total of 14 episodes of Pseudomonas peritonitis in 12 patients (6 male, 6 female) were treated with intraperitoneal (IP) administration of a combination of ceftazidime and tobramycin. All patients were hospitalized. The loading doses were 1000 mg\/2 L of ceftazidime and 1.7 mg\/kg of tobramycin, and the maintenance IP doses were 250 mg\/2 L of ceftazidime and 16 mg\/2 L of tobramycin. The therapy duration was 14 days. In 7 episodes (group A) no other antibiotic regimen was provided, while in the remaining 7 episodes (group B) therapy was continued with 500 mg b.i.d. of oral ciprofloxacin for the next 14 days. Pseudomonas species isolated in group A were P. alcaligenis (1), P. putida (1), P. maltophilia (1), R. cepacia (1), and unidentified (3). In group B the following Pseudomonas species were isolated: P. aeruginosa (4), P. diminuta (1), P. stutszeri (1), and unidentified (1). Recurrence of peritonitis was seen in 4 episodes of group A with 2 catheter removals, while all episodes were cured in group B. These results suggest that IP ceftazidime and tobramycin with the additional use of oral ciprofloxacin is successful in the treatment and prevention of relapses of Pseudomonas peritonitis.","1106":"Two patients with end-stage renal disease from diabetes mellitus on peritoneal dialysis for 2 or more years developed sterile peritonitis secondary to splenic infarcts with associated peripheral embolic phenomena. The dialysate had WBC counts &gt; 200\/microL, of which 70% or more were polymorphonuclear cells, and RBC counts of 60\/microL or less, although transient hemoperitoneum occurred in both patients. Extensive atherosclerotic vascular disease as well as hematologic abnormalities were also present in both patients. One patient had polycythemia due to decreased plasma volume. The other patient had evidence of dysfibrinogenemia. The patients responded well to anticoagulation with warfarin. When the warfarin was discontinued, recurrent emboli occurred in both patients. Splenic infarct should be included in the differential diagnosis of diabetic patients with atherosclerotic disease who present with sterile peritonitis that does not respond to antibiotic therapy, especially if hemoperitoneum occurs even transiently. The diagnosis can be confirmed with CT scan of the abdomen. Warfarin therapy is effective in preventing recurrent embolic phenomena, but may need to be continued indefinitely.","1107":"Clinical features, diagnosis and outcomes of persistently positive dialysate culture (PPDC) after apparent cure of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) peritonitis were investigated in 16 PPDC episodes observed in 16 elderly (age 62 +\/- 8 years) men who had been on CAPD for 14 +\/- 9 months. Seven patients (46.7%) were diabetic. Peritonitis was caused by S. aureus in 14 cases and S. epidermidis in 2 cases. Preexisting or simultaneous infectious foci were present in 15 cases, exit-site infection in 5, tunnel infection in 13, and intra-abdominal abscess in 2 cases. Indium scans were positive in 6\/9 cases (67%). Two patients died with the peritoneal catheter in situ, one from intercurrent myocardial infarction and one from S. aureus sepsis with pneumonia. In another 14 cases the peritoneal catheters were removed because of either tunnel abscess (8 cases) or peritonitis recurrence (6 cases). PPDC following apparent cure of CAPD peritonitis is almost always associated with exit-site, tunnel, or intra-abdominal abscess and leads invariably to catheter loss. Associated mortality is substantial.","1108":"Data comparing peritoneal dialysis (PD)-related infection rates between diabetic and nondiabetic patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis are conflicting. We carried out a prospective study comparing PD-related infection rates between diabetic and nondiabetic patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in our center. All patients commencing CAPD between January 1989 and June 1992 were enrolled into the study. Patients were followed up until death, CAPD dropout, or until December 1992. Data on diabetes mellitus status, Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage, and PD-related infections were gathered. Infection rates were analyzed using life tables and the negative binomial test. One hundred and seven diabetic patients and 72 nondiabetic patients were studied. Patients with diabetes mellitus were not at increased risk of being S. aureus nasal carriers. The peritonitis rate was significantly higher in the diabetic group (1.2 vs 0.8 episodes\/patient\/year, p &lt; 0.05). The exit-site and tunnel infection, catheter loss, and patient dropout rates were not significantly different between the two groups. Life-table analysis did not show a significant difference in the time to first episode of peritonitis and catheter-related infection.","1109":"Peritoneal cells in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients are continually being regenerated. We previously reported that nocturnal peritoneal effluent is mitogenic on human and mouse fibroblasts in culture, especially when a comitogen is present. The nature, origin, and role of this mitogenic activity remain undetermined. The data resulting from the addition of different comitogen to dialysate suggest that the peritoneal effluent contains different growth factors with molecular weight greater than 10,000 dalton. Also, the presence of a growth inhibitor is plausible. In conclusion, different growth-promoting and inhibiting activities are present in the peritoneal effluent, suggesting a complex cellular relationship as a result of peritoneal dialysis with unknown consequences.","1110":"Sclerosing peritonitis (ScP) is a rare but fatal complication of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), presenting as small bowel obstruction. We have observed that only patients receiving a renal transplant survived more than a few months after the diagnosis of ScP. We now report prolonged survival of patients given immunosuppressive therapy with or without a functioning transplant. ScP was found at laparotomy in 17 Glasgow patients, 15 of whom had been exposed to chlorhexidine in alcohol. All patients discontinued CAPD after diagnosis. Within a year 12 died with recurrent bowel obstruction; none received immunosuppressive therapy. The remaining 5 patients received immunosuppressive therapy; 4 are alive between 1 and 9 years later, and one patient with widespread vascular disease died after 3 years with mesenteric ischemia. Four of the 5 received a renal transplant. One patient rejected his transplant; when immunosuppression was stopped he developed symptoms suggestive of recurrent ScP. Immunosuppressive therapy was restarted and he remains well 3 years later. The fifth patient, who did not receive a transplant, was immunosuppressed after ScP was diagnosed. She remains well 18 months later. Our experience suggests that immunosuppression is beneficial in ScP.","1111":"Routine laboratory testing of the susceptibility of infecting strains of S. epidermidis to antibiotics is based on the assumptions that the infection is in contact with the stable environment of blood or tissue fluid and that the bacteria are in a susceptible phase of growth. In infections of the continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) intraperitoneal catheter, the bacteria are commonly in the resistant biofilm phase of growth, are applied to the surface of the catheter, and are exposed to the nonphysiological impact of peritoneal dialysis solutions. The possible impact of these two variables is not examined in routine testing of antibiotic susceptibility. We describe an assay of antibacterial action on a strain of S. epidermidis in the biofilm phase, exposed to a neutral control environment and to dialysis solutions, both fresh and spent. Rifampin, which has an incomplete action in a neutral control environment, was used as a sensitive indicator of possible synergistic or antagonistic interaction of the biofilm bacteria with the dialysis environments. We demonstrated that peritoneal dialysis solutions (1.5% dextrose), both fresh and spent, were synergistic with rifampin action against S. epidermidis biofilms, converting the incomplete killing action to a total bactericidal outcome, clinically essential for cure. Fresh dialysis solution was more active than spent, but in both instances the synergy was complete, indicating that the crucial complementation of the bactericidal action of rifampin was independent of pH. These findings have implications in the management of catheter-associated infections due to rifampin-susceptible strains of S. epidermidis.","1112":"The studies on the comparative efficacy of erythropoietin (rHuEPO) in chronic hemodialysis and peritoneal dialysis patients are scarce. We compared the use of rHuEPO in 74 stable patients on hemodialysis to 24 on chronic peritoneal dialysis. All patients were on oral iron supplement. In peritoneal dialysis patients hematocrit was 23.1% and 30.1%, rHuEPO dose 80.9 U\/kg\/week, while in hemodialysis patients hematocrit was 21.2% and 27.5%, and rHuEPO dose was 140.2 and 165.0 U\/kg\/week at commencement and after 6 months, respectively. Serum iron and transferrin saturation were unchanged in peritoneal dialysis patients, but decreased in hemodialysis patients with rHuEPO therapy. These findings suggest that rHuEPO is more effective in peritoneal dialysis patients than in hemodialysis patients receiving oral iron. The improved efficacy of rHuEPO in peritoneal dialysis may be due to decreased blood loss, subcutaneous administration, and\/or better removal of inhibitors of erythropoiesis. Peritoneal dialysis may be more cost-effective and desirable than hemodialysis for rHuEPO-dependent or -resistant patients.","1113":"This report summarizes the experience with 17 pregnancies in 16 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients. Early experience suggests that the outcome of pregnancy in CAPD patients may be better than in hemodialysis patients. Catheter placement can be undertaken during pregnancy with little increased risk. Peritonitis can precipitate premature labor. Blood-tinged dialysate may herald serious obstetric problems. Hypertension, anemia, and prematurity are serious problems in CAPD patients. Cesarean section can be done, with only a brief interruption in CAPD. The major modification of the usual regimen is the need for smaller exchange volumes and increased frequency. Clinicians should counsel continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients about contraceptive use.  Hypertension contraindicates the pill.  CAPD patients should not use IUDs, since they increase the risk of peritonitis.  They can use barrier methods.  Pregnancy is often not detected until late.  The literature shows that 16 CAPD patients have had 17 pregnancies.  65% of the pregnancies resulted in surviving infants.  Pregnancies of all women who conceived before starting dialysis were successful, compared to just 4 of 10 women who conceived after starting dialysis.  CAPD patients have a more successful pregnancy rate than do hemodialysis patients, but the numbers are too small to be significant and selection bias may exist.  Clinicians placed 11 catheters in 8 of the 16 CAPD patients between 4-29 weeks gestation. Fetal position contributed to outflow obstruction.  Just 1 patient had dialysate leak.  3 peritonitis episodes occurred.  Cephradine, gentamicin, cefadyl, and vancomycin were used to treat peritonitis.  2 women went into labor and delivered shortly after the onset of peritonitis.  The infant delivered at 34 weeks survived, while the one delivered at 24 weeks was stillborn.  Bloody dialysate was present in 3 pregnancies.  It signaled abruptio placentae and subsequent fetal loss in 1 case, severe subserosal hemorrhage of the uterine wall in another case, and laceration of uterine vessels by the catheter.  Hypertension complicated 9 pregnancies, but physicians managed it well and it did not cause premature delivery.  6 women had serum hemoglobin levels between 5.4 and 9 g\/L.  Just 2 received erythropoietin during pregnancy. Premature labor occurred in 9 pregnancies.  CAPD infants are small for their gestational age.  Cesarean section with no need for catheter removal was the delivery mode for 6 live born infants.  Physicians had to hold dialysis for 24-72 hours after surgery.  Smaller exchange volumes and increased frequency of dialysis are major changes in the usual regimen for pregnant CAPD patients. ","1114":"An obese 48-year-old diabetic woman with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) developed symptomatic cholelithiasis within 2 weeks of initiating CAPD. She was not a good risk for either open cholecystectomy or postoperative hemodialysis, and the relatively noninvasive surgical approach of laparoscopic cholecystectomy was considered to minimize postoperative morbidity and to allow the patient to resume her CAPD treatments after a short postoperative recess from dialysis altogether. The patient tolerated the procedure well with no complications. She resumed routine CAPD on her third postoperative day.","1115":"We performed a retrospective chart review of 32 patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) for longer than 5 months (range 5-64 months) in an attempt to identify risk factors influencing the preservation of renal function. Residual renal function (RRF) was evaluated by measurement of creatinine clearance (Ccr) from 24-hour urine collections. Risk factors examined included age and Ccr at start of PD, presence of diabetes, mean arterial pressure (MAP), diastolic blood pressure (DBP), and peritonitis rate. Multiple regression analysis was performed to determine the correlation of these factors to the rate of decline of Ccr. Loss of RRF in all patients was 0.3 mL\/min\/month (median 0.2, range 0.04-1.7). The contribution of RRF to total Ccr was 39% (range 12%-72.5%). Patient age, presence of diabetes, MAP, DBP, peritonitis rate, and Ccr at the start of PD had no influence on the rate of RRF loss. Nine patients in the study (28%) had been on PD longer than 2 years and still had significant renal function (mean Ccr 3.3 mL\/min), which was 40% of their total weekly Ccr. These results show that PD patients can maintain RRF for extended periods and that RRF contributes substantially to their weekly Ccr. The risk factors evaluated did not influence the rate of renal function loss.","1116":"In a 1991 prospective evaluation of infections and catheters in Network 9 (Indiana, Kentucky, Ohio), detailed demographic questionnaires on 1930 patients were examined, with special attention to practice management and comparisons between black and white patients. In Network 9, 18.2% of peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients were black compared to 22.6% in the USRDS, and 3.7% of PD patients were black and more than 65 years of age, compared to 3.7% in the USRDS. Statistically significant associations were found in the Network 9 data base. Blacks were less likely than whites to be under 16 years or over 65 years of age, to add insulin to bag, to have nasal cultures performed, to have received previous immunosuppression, to wear exit-site dressings, and to do their own tubing changes. Blacks are more likely than whites to be independent (not age-related), ambulatory (not age-related), to have had previous peritonitis, surgical catheter placement, and to do their own exchanges. There were no differences regarding the number of training days and the use of disconnect or other exchange systems or cyclers.","1117":"The lymphatic vessels have sympathetic innervation. Noradrenaline increases the number of spontaneous contractions of the lymphatic vessels, whereas isoprenaline slows these contractions. The purpose of this study was to analyze the influence of the blockade of spontaneous contractions of the lymphatic vessels on the lymphatic absorption rate (LAR) in 6 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) by using 0.12 mg of isoprenaline added to 2 L of 2.5% dextrose dialysis solution. This dose of isoprenaline has been shown to inhibit bovine mesenteric lymphatic contractions. The LAR was measured by the quantification of the intraperitoneal disappearance of dextran 70 added to this same dialysis solution during a 4-hour dwell. All patients were submitted to a control test without isoprenaline. The LAR was 0.57 +\/- 0.19 and 0.65 +\/- 0.38 mL\/minute (p &gt; 0.05), with and without isoprenaline, respectively. We conclude that spontaneous contractions of the lymphatic vessels do not play an important role in the lymphatic drainage mechanism of the peritoneal cavity. The diaphragmatic contractions seem to be more important, since drugs that interfere with such diaphragmatic mechanisms alter the LAR.","1118":"This study was designed to measure blood platelet levels in patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) and to compare platelet levels between diabetic and nondiabetic PD patients. Serial blood platelet levels were measured in 53 stable PD patients (32 male, 21 female; mean age 55 years; mean duration of PD 19 months) and 45 stable hemodialysis (HD) patients (30 male, 15 female; mean age 53 years; mean duration of HD 9 months) between January 1991 and July 1992. Twenty-four patients were diabetics, and 29 patients were nondiabetics receiving PD. Ten patients were diabetics, and 35 were nondiabetics receiving HD. Serial blood platelet levels were measured with an automated Coulter counter. Eighteen of 53 PD patients (34%) had platelet counts exceeding 300,000\/mm3 for 6 months or longer. Thirteen of 24 diabetic PD patients (54%) had thrombocytosis. Blood platelets were significantly (p &lt; 0.01) higher in diabetic (324 +\/- 27 x 10(3)\/mm3) than nondiabetic PD (236 +\/- 11 x 10(3)\/mm3) patients. No significant difference was observed in platelet count between diabetic type I (366 +\/- 43 x 10(3)\/mm3) and type II (282 +\/- 29 x 10(3)\/mm3) PD patients. A positive correlation was observed between blood platelet and serum cholesterol (r = 0.5, p &lt; 0.001), blood platelet, and serum calcium (r = 0.4, p &lt; 0.002), and blood platelet and WBC (r = 0.7, p &lt; 0.001). No correlation was found with age or duration of PD. In conclusion, diabetic PD patients have elevated blood platelet levels that may contribute to occlusive vessel disease.","1119":"Abdominal serositis and mesenteric vasculitis are complications of SLE. We report a case of SLE presenting as abdominal pain in a CAPD patient. Lupus serositis\/mesenteric vasculitis should be considered in the differential diagnosis of a CAPD patient with SLE who presents with abdominal pain but benign cell counts and cultures. This is especially important since untreated mesenteric vasculitis can lead to bowel perforation and death.","1120":"End-stage renal disease (ESRD) is one of the most significant complications of systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Previous investigators have evaluated the morbidity and mortality of different renal replacement treatment modalities in these patients. Earlier reports have suggested that the systemic manifestations of SLE diminish, or \"burn out,\" once ESRD occurs. These investigators also suggested that vascular access complications were a significant cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients treated with hemodialysis (HD). A retrospective review of the records of 6 patients with ESRD from lupus nephritis (LN), who received both HD and peritoneal dialysis (PD), was performed to determine if there was a difference in disease activity between treatment modalities, using patients as self-controls. The number of SLE flares was determined by clinical and\/or serologic studies, and prednisone dosages compared for each treatment modality. Four of the 6 patients continued to have active SLE after renal replacement therapy was begun. There were no significant differences in the number of SLE flares or prednisone dosages while receiving either treatment modality. While PD eliminates problems associated with vascular access, both HD and PD were effective forms of renal replacement therapy. Most patients in this study continued to have active SLE after commencement of dialysis, with no differences in disease activity noted during HD or PD.","1121":"In order to screen for abstruse lead poisoning in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients, delta-aminolevulinic acid dehydratase (ALAD) levels were measured in 18 CAPD patients, 156 patients treated with hemodialysis (HD), and 420 control patients with normal renal function (NRF). An EDTA (ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid) mobilization test was performed in patients with low levels of ALAD (&lt; 0.40 mumol of porphobilinogen formed per milliliter of red blood cells): 1 g of EDTA was infused IV followed by 20 L of hemofiltrate in HD patients and four bags of dialysate in CAPD patients. Lead was assayed in the ultrafiltrate liquid, the bags of dialysate, and in the 24-hour urine. ALAD levels were significantly lower in CAPD and HD patients than in the NRF subjects. ALAD was significantly correlated with EDTA mobilized lead in both dialysis and NRF patients. Using the usual criteria (EDTA mobilized lead &gt; 800 micrograms\/24 hours), the rate of lead poisoning observed was similar in the two groups. These results suggest that ALAD assay followed by the EDTA mobilization test is as effective in CAPD patients as in NRF subjects to diagnose and to treat chronic abstruse lead poisoning.","1122":"Numerous factors related to the composition of peritoneal dialysis solutions (PDS) contribute to the pathogenesis of peritoneal fibrosis during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). They include high osmolarity, low pH, and the presence of lactate, which may be responsible for stimulating the proliferation of peritoneal fibroblasts (PF) and for the toxicity on the peritoneal mesothelial cells (PMC). Similar effects could be hypothesized for the plasticizers released from the PDS bags, usually made of polyvinyl chloride (PVC), such as the acid esters of phthalic acid, particularly bis-(2-ethylhexyl) phthalate (BEHP). Recently, however, new BEHP-free bags (Clear-Flex, Bieffe, Italy) made of three layers (polyethylene, nylon, and polypropylene) have been introduced. The aim of this work is to evaluate in vitro the effects of samples of PDS contained in PVC bags (Bieffe) and in Clear-Flex bags on the proliferative capacity of peritoneal fibroblasts and peritoneal mesothelial cells, and the release of interferon gamma (IFN gamma), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) from peritoneal T lymphocytes (PTLs) and macrophages (PM phi s). Results have shown that in the presence of PDS samples contained in PVC bags, the proliferative capacity of peritoneal fibroblasts was higher than in Clear-Flexbags. There was also an increased release of IFN-gamma and IL-1 from PTLs and PM phi s (cytokines that stimulate the collagen synthesis) and a decreased release of PGE2 (cytokines which inhibit the collagen synthesis). An inhibiting action on peritoneal mesothelial cells was also seen.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1123":"This study was designed to investigate the outcome of all elderly patients older than 65 who started peritoneal dialysis (PD) between January 1989 and December 1992. One hundred and twenty end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients commenced PD at our institution between January 1989 and December 1992. All the patients who started, completed PD training, and remained on PD for more than one month were included in the study. Of these, 30 patients were elderly (more than 65 years old) with a mean age of 72 years (range 66-81 years). The total number of patient-months observed was 2035, of which the elderly represented 454 patient-months. Twenty-five percent (30 of 120 patients) were elderly. The causes of ESRD were diabetes mellitus in 6 patients (20%), glomerulonephritis in 6 (20%), atheroembolic disease in 4 (13.3%), hypertension in 2 (6.7%), and unknown etiology in 10 (33.3%) patients. Sixteen patients performed continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and 14 patients continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). Five patients required private home nurses for multiple medical problems and for PD. Mean duration of peritoneal dialysis per patient was 15 months. Four patients were transferred to incenter hemodialysis, one each because of failure to thrive, insurance, catheter malfunction, and fungal peritonitis. One patient recovered renal function after 22 months of PD. Twenty-one episodes of peritonitis occurred over 454 patient-months (1 episode\/22 patient-months). In conclusion, the elderly patients on PD have a favorable outcome even with multiple comorbid conditions.","1124":"This study was designed to investigate trained home nurses in the care of elderly and disabled end-stage renal disease (ESRD) patients receiving peritoneal dialysis (PD) in all the patients who entered our home program between January 1989 and December 1992. We trained nursing staff from nursing agencies to do PD. A weekly nursing summary including daily vitals, PD flow sheet, medications, and progress notes was sent to the home program. The trained nurses were also utilized temporarily during acute deterioration of patients or partners resulting in the inability to do PD. Eleven patients were female, 10 were male, with a mean age of 62 years (range 30-81 years). Ten patients (48%) had diabetes mellitus. Thirteen patients performed continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) and 8 patients continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis. Five patients required home nurses temporarily for a period of 1-8 weeks until the patients became independent. Two patients were transferred to incenter hemodialysis, one because of insurance and one because of fungal peritonitis. One patient recovered renal function after 22 months of PD. Thirty-three episodes of peritonitis occurred over 417 patient-months (one episode\/13 patient-months). Three patients needed catheter removal secondary to Candida peritonitis. Hospitalization rate and duration of stay were lower (1 admission\/6 patient-months) than patient-months without home nurses (1\/4 patient-months). The main causes of these admissions were diabetic complications (38%), cardiac disease (20%), and peritonitis (14%). In conclusion, our experience suggests that elderly and disabled patients on PD with home nurses have a favorable outcome even with multiple, comorbid conditions.","1125":"Reports of clinical outcomes after commencement of dialysis treatment among elderly patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) are not been numerous. This paper describes the demographic and clinical characteristics of the elderly treated for ESRD in Canada using the Canadian Organ Replacement Register data. Comparisons with younger age groups are also presented. Analyses of data for the period 1981-1991 indicated that the elderly (65+) represent an expanding portion of all new ESRD patients in Canada. Distributions of dialysis modalities showed no major differences by age groups (45-54, 55-64, 65-75, 75+). However, the overall usage of intermittent peritoneal dialysis has decreased over time (from 17% of patients in 1981-83 to 7% in 1990-91). Deaths from social causes were slightly more frequent among the elderly (15.9% of all deaths among those aged 65+ vs 10% among those aged 45-64). Moreover, deaths from infections were more common among patients on dialysis for a longer period of time and more common among patients on peritoneal dialysis than among those on hemodialysis. Discontinuations of continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) because of the inability to cope increased with age. Patients with comorbid conditions were more likely to receive hemodialysis, and, as expected, the presence of these conditions increased with age and significantly reduced survival. Other determinants of survival included calendar period of registration, renal center size, and treatment modality. This paper illustrates the many changes over time in the elderly population treated for ESRD. Also of importance, however, is the elderly Canadian population with ESRD which is not presently treated.","1126":"Loss of net ultrafiltration capacity is an important complication in long-term continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). It has been reported in animal studies that the drained volumes after a dwell period were larger when amphotericin B had been given intraperitoneally. In this study the effect of intraperitoneally administered amphotericin B on fluid kinetics was evaluated in 3 CAPD patients. The first patient lost 2.5 kg body weight during the first 4 days of treatment, whereas the net ultrafiltration in the second patient was higher in the treatment period compared with the nontreatment period (750 +\/- 38 mL\/day vs 438 +\/- 34 mL\/day (mean +\/- SEM), p &lt; 0.0001). In the last patient it can be demonstrated that the increase in the net ultrafiltration was caused by an increase in the transcapillary ultrafiltration (570 vs 454 mL\/4 hours), but that lymphatic absorption was not different (251 vs 265 mL\/4 hours). The higher transcapillary ultrafiltration capacity is probably caused by an increase in the hydraulic permeability. It is likely that this phenomenon is governed by the interaction of amphotericin B with membrane-bound cholesterol leading to the formation of transcellular pores. However, the administration of amphotericin B caused a chemical peritonitis, probably due to its solvent, sodium desoxycholate. Therefore, before amphotericin B can be used for the treatment of CAPD patients with ultrafiltration failure, further investigations are necessary to obtain a solvent for amphotericin B that is nontoxic and causes no chemical peritonitis.","1127":"Peritoneal transport characteristics (PTC) may change without peritonitis, surgery, or other insults. Identifying patients with these changes is essential in adjusting the dialysis prescription to achieve optimal peritoneal dialysis on a long-term basis. Frequent standard peritoneal equilibration tests (PETs) become impractical as the population in individual programs expands. The time demands are burdensome to the nursing staff as well as to the patient. The accuracy of fast PETs is dependent upon the patient's exact adherence to the protocol steps. Utilizing the 24-hour D\/P as a marker for altered PTCs has improved the efficiency of our approach to repeating standard PETs and ensuring dialysis adequacy. For adequacy studies, pooled 24-hour dialysate is routinely collected in our unit. The 24-hour D\/P ratio correlates well with extrapolations from original PET data and the patient's current dwell times. Discrepancies noted between the patient's actual D\/P ratio and the patient's expected D\/P ratio alert the clinician to possible PTC changes.","1128":"To determine peritoneal dialysis patients' dietary energy requirements, the glucose absorbed from the dialysate needs to be quantified. The currently accepted method of estimating glucose absorption is based on the average glucose absorption of 7 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients (Grodstein, 1981). Peritoneal equilibration test curves have shown that modality and transport characteristics affect glucose absorption. To test a more accurate procedure for estimating glucose absorption, we compared two different methods of determining the actual glucose absorption: Grodstein formula: (11.3 xa-10.9) liters of dialysate, where xa is the average glucose concentration, and the D\/D0 formula: (1-D\/D0)xi, where xi is the initial glucose instilled, using 4-hour D\/D0 for CAPD and dwell time D\/D0 for automated peritoneal dialysis (APD). Twenty-four-hour glucose absorption was measured in 50 CAPD patients and 17 APD patients. Absorption was calculated from the glucose remaining in the 24-hour spent dialysate. Wilcoxon sign rank statistical analysis showed the D\/D0 formula results to be closer to actual glucose absorbed (CAPD: p = 0.0153; APD: p = 0.0001). The D\/D0 formula is individualized for patients' modality and membrane characteristics and easy to calculate from readily available information.","1129":"Means of enhancing the efficiency of dialysis in automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) should be sought. Optimum cycles of exchange in APD were studied using a simple urea kinetic model. The amount of dialysis urea was expressed as the total amount removed divided by the initial plasma level (M\/CB). A highly significant correlation between calculated and measured M\/CB levels (r = 0.902, p &lt; 0.001) was observed. The kinetic study indicated an increase in cycles to greatly enhance M\/CB for high membrane transporter patients, in contrast to low transporters. Maximum M\/CB for 8 hours was obtained by 5 cycles at D\/P (120 minutes) of 0.4, 6 cycles at D\/P of 0.7, and 9 at D\/P of 0.9 when 2 L were infused. An increase in infusion volume from 2--3 L augmented M\/CB by only 7% at D\/P of 0.4, while M\/CB was augmented by 14% at D\/P of 0.9. The optimum number of cycles may thus be concluded to depend on peritoneal membrane permeability. A high transporter patient requires frequent exchanges for increasing dialysis efficiency, whereas a low transporter patient does not.","1130":"In a 12-week crossover study we assessed the effect of tidal volume peritoneal dialysis (TVPD) on serum chemistry, patient well-being, appetite and sleep, blood pressure, and body weight period and compared it with the effect of intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD) on these same parameters over a similar period. We used similar volumes of dialysis solutions per exchange and session, and the exchanges were of the same duration in each session. There were 12 patients (6 males, 6 females) with a mean age of 76 years (range 61-88 years), and mean duration of peritoneal dialysis 49 months (range 20-148 months). Five patients started with TVPD and switched to IPD after 3 months; the remaining 7 patients started with IPD and switched to TVPD for the next 3 months. No differences were seen between TVPD and IPD in any of the measured parameters: body weight, appetite, sleep, and well-being by self-assessment, number of transfusions, and complications related to peritoneal dialysis. There were two episodes of peritonitis during the TVPD period and none during the IPD period. Our data indicate that TVPD and IPD are equally effective when applied over similar durations and with similar volumes of dialysis solutions in each session. The improved results with TVPD that others have reported probably can be explained by the use of higher volumes of dialysate.","1131":"The impact of hydration status on body composition analysis in hemodialysis (HD) and peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients was assessed. Twenty-seven HD patients and 42 PD patients were divided into three groups according to their (postdialytic) hydration status as measured by segmental bioelectrical impedance analysis (BIA): normohydrated, dehydrated, or overhydrated. Fifty-six percent of the PD patients and 74% of the HD patients appeared to be normohydrated. Lean body mass (LBM) was calculated in all subjects from skinfold anthropometric (SA) measurements and from whole body BIA data. LBM-SA and LBM-BIA did not differ in normohydrated patients and correlated well with each other (r = 0.88). In overhydrated subjects BIA overestimated LBM compared to SA; in the dehydrated group BIA tended to underestimate LBM. The correlation between LBM-SA and LBM-BIA was poor in both groups. It can be concluded that hydration status has a major influence on BIA-based LBM measurements. Reliable LBM figures can only be obtained when patients are at their ideal dry weight.","1132":"","1133":"The purpose of this study was to determine the influence of hydrostatic intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) and cardiac function (CF) on the lymphatic absorption rate (LAR) in 9 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The LAR was measured by estimation of the intraperitoneal disappearance of dextran 70 added to 2 L of 2.5% dextrose dialysis solution. The patients remained in the supine position during the 4-hour dwell. The IPP was obtained by measuring a column of dialysate in the peritoneal dialysis line, immediately before the drainage of the peritoneal cavity. The pressure was measured at the level of the umbilical cicatrix with point zero located on the mid axillary line of the patient. IPP was measured at inspiration and expiration, and the average of these two measurements was taken. These patients also underwent an echocardiographic examination. The LAR was 0.46 +\/- 0.25 mL\/minute, and the IPP was 13.07 +\/- 2.61 cm H2O. The IPP correlated positively with the LAR (r = 0.80, p &lt; 0.05). The intraperitoneal volume at the 4-hour dwell correlated inversely with the IPP (r = -0.68, p &lt; 0.05). The left ventricular circumferential shortened fraction was 36 +\/- 6% (27%-43%) and did not correlate with the LAR. These data suggest that the LAR is higher in patients with more elevated IPP. In addition, the CF, in the range studied, does not affect the lymphatic absorption rate.","1134":"Two selected groups of 5 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients (3 female, 7 male), mean age 60 years, were studied twice with an interval of 4 weeks. The first study was done with glucose-containing dialysate and the second study with dialysate containing glucose polymers (Dextrin 7.5%) after they had been treated with this solution (night dwell) for 4 weeks. The patients collected night bags for 3 consecutive days during the tests. Protein clearances were determined for beta 2-microglobulin, albumin, IgG, fibronectin, and alpha 2-macroglobulin in both periods to examine the influence of crystalloid-induced convection versus \"colloid\"-induced convection. Group I normally used 1.50% glucose and was therefore considered to have a \"high ultrafiltration\";group II was the \"low ultrafiltration\" group because they needed 4.25% glucose dialysate. For their usual glucose solutions the net ultrafiltration was not different between both groups, but the clearance of beta 2-microglobulin was higher in group II:839 +\/- 98 microL\/min (group I) and 1135 +\/- 131 microL\/min (group II) (p = 0.08). For glucose polymers the net ultrafiltration increased in both groups, but this was more pronounced in group II: 657 +\/- 104 mL (group I) and 918 +\/- 85 mL (group II) (p = 0.06). Also, the clearance of beta 2-microglobulin increased with the glucose polymer solution: 1268 +\/- 94 microL\/min (for glucose polymer) and 987 +\/- 85 microL\/min (for glucose) (p &lt; 0.05), but the clearances of the larger serum proteins remained unaffected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1135":"Urea kinetics have been used to measure adequacy of hemodialysis. The role of urea kinetics in CAPD has not been clearly established. Using urea kinetics, we studied 71 hemodialysis and 71 CAPD patients. Age was 53 +\/- 12 and 45.8 +\/- 12 respectively. Urea kinetics in hemodialysis were studied in the standard manner. CAPD patients collected 24 hr, dialysate fluid to measure urea, creatinine, glucose and protein. Urine was collected for 24 hr. to measure urea and creatinine. Protein catabolic rate (pcr) was calculated from the total amount of urea cleared in 24 h. Both groups of patients had similar body weight. Kt\/V in CAPD (0.65 +\/- 0.1) was at a level considered underdialysis for hemodialysis. In both groups, pcr increased as Kt\/V increased. However, CAPD patients had levels of pcr higher than hemodialysis patients at the same level of Kt\/V. BUN, serum albumin and serum potassium were significantly lower in CAPD patients. Patients who dialyze more, eat more. Differences in protein intake may be due to a more liberal diet in CAPD, patient selection, removal of middle molecules, or better control of the acidosis.","1136":"The authors studied the effect of lovastatin on five hypercholesterolemic CAPD patients with high risk of atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease. Patients took lovastatin 20 mg once daily for a mean period of 4.5 months. Pre- and post-treatment values of LDL and VLDL totals (325 mg\/dl and 292 mg\/dl, respectively) and of HDL (42 mg\/dl and 43 mg\/dl, respectively) had no significant statistical difference. Lack of significance may be due to low number of patients and short trial time. The study did demonstrate that lovastatin is well tolerated in CAPD patients.","1137":"The average free choline level was determined to be 14 M in peritoneal dialysates and 22 M in plasma of thirty patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Daily choline loss via dialysate averaged 129 moles with 32 moles choline lost per dwell. Daily choline loss via the dialysate was positively correlated with plasma choline concentrations. Choline levels in dialysate during CAPD exceed plasma levels of choline (9 M) in healthy individuals.","1138":"The progress of automated peritoneal dialysis is initmately linked to the evolution of automated peritoneal delivery systems. The state of the art devices have incorporated computerized programs capable of delivering precise timing and volumes of dialysate and have made possible the delivery of CCPD, NPD, IPD or TPD with either time-controlled or volume-controlled delivery modes. Data storage and telephone transmission to the center have also helped in assessing compliance and documentation of dialysis delivered. The most common indications for automated peritoneal dialysis remain patient preference and the need for partner assistance. However, new indications have emerged from our better understanding of peritoneal dialysis kinetics and the recent emphasis on dialysis prescription and quality assurance.","1139":"Urea kinetics and the use of KT\/V has become a useful tool for assessing adequacy of small solute removal in HD. Clinical data supporting the benefit of urea kinetic analysis in CAPD patients had been lacking. Using the standards of KT\/V for hemodialysis, many CAPD patients would be underdialyzed but, most studies show no significant difference in morbidity or mortality between CAPD and HD patients. We studied retrospectively, 102 patients (48 M, 54 F), aged 54.6 +\/- 14.8 (range 14-82), on CAPD 24.4 +\/- 23.9 months (0-120) from 6 hospitals. Clinical and biochemical parameters, co-morbidity, mortality, and hospital admission rate were registered. During the follow-up (1 year), a significant decrease of residual renal function (Kr) from 1.74 +\/- 1.86 to 1.31 +\/- 1.67 (p &lt; 0.01) was noticed. The KT\/V also decreased from 2.00 +\/- 0.47 to 1.89 +\/- 0.36 (p &lt; 0.01) without change in BUN or plasma creatinine levels. The normalized protein catabolic rate (NPCR) decreased from 0.98 +\/- 0.28 to 0.93 +\/- 0.30 (p &lt; 0.05) and serum albumin from 3.7 +\/- 0.5 to 3.5 +\/- 0.6 (p &lt; 0.001). There was a positive correlation between NPCR and KT\/V (r = 0.44, p &lt; 0.05) and between NPCR with serum BUN (r = 0.27, p &lt; 0.05). There was no correlation between KT\/V and NPCR neither with hospitalization rate nor clinical symptoms index. The latter, however, showed a positive correlation with the co-morbidity index.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1140":"The adequacy of peritoneal dialysis should be defined by clinical outcomes. Studies using multivariate techniques to evaluate the effect of demographic and clinical risk factors on these clinical outcomes showed worse patient survival for age &gt; 60 years, diabetes mellitus, history of cardiovascular disease, black race and prior ESRD therapy. The single study reporting a multivariate analysis of urea kinetics and these baseline prognostic factors on clinical outcome showed serum albumin to be the most powerful predictor of survival. A multicentre study (10 Canadian and 4 US Centres) has enrolled 374 consecutive new peritoneal dialysis patients. The target enrollment is 600 patients. Among these 374 patients are 217 males (58%), 71 patients age &gt; 70 (19%), 106 with diabetic renal disease (28%), 95 with a history of cardiovascular disease (25%) and 60 with serum albumin values &lt; 30 Gm\/L (16%). There are 307 white patients (82%) and 26 black patients (7%). The 9 month probabilities were: for patient survival, 96%; for technique survival, 93%; peritonitis-free survival, 68%; exit site infection-free survival, 71%. Final statistical analysis will use multivariate techniques to evaluate the relationships among baseline prognostic factors, nutritional status and clinical outcomes.","1141":"We studied normalized urea nitrogen appearance (NUNA), normalized protein catabolic rate (NPCR), and normalized daily creatinine excretion (NDCE) in twenty-one patients (15 men, 6 women; mean age 63 +\/- 9 years) on CAPD for more than 4 years (80 +\/- 27 months). In the same patients we evaluated the changes in serum albumin and transferrin with time. After 74 +\/- 26 months on CAPD, NUNA was 0.12 +\/- 0.03 g\/Kg IBW\/day, NPCR = 1.09 +\/- 0.19 g\/Kg IBW\/day; NDCE = 15.1 +\/- 3.1 mg\/Kg IBW\/day; serum albumin = 3.8 +\/- 0.2 g\/dl. NUNA was correlated with NPCR (p &lt; 0.001) and both were correlated with NDCE (p = 0.007 and p = 0.008). NPCR significantly decreased as patient age increased (p = 0.007) but was not correlated with time on CAPD, sex or serum albumin. Serum albumin did not change as age increased. Serum albumin and serum transferrin had not significantly changed after 4 years (after 8 years in a subgroup of eight patients). Finally, we compared these data to the initial data recorded for the same patients (mean interval: 64 +\/- 21 months). NUNA, NPCR and NDCE did not change significantly. Changes in NPCR were directly related to changes in NDCE (p = 0.019). This study supports that long-term CAPD does not necessarily impair nutritional status and suggests that the oldest patients can maintain stable serum albumin concentrations on lower protein intake than younger ones.","1142":"The adequacy of the peritoneal dialysis prescription is of great concern. Although the use of urea kinetics has become the standard in hemodialysis, its usefulness in peritoneal dialysis is unclear. It has been suggested that creatinine clearance may correlate with clinical outcome in CAPD but, as with urea kinetics, its predictive value is not established. The efficacy number (EN), which only requires a four hour exchange, was introduced as a simpler approach to creatinine kinetics. These three kinetic models were correlated to clinical outcome in 18 stable CAPD patients over a 12 month study period. The patients were divided into three groups: good (G), intermediate (I), and poor (P) based on uremic symptoms, mortality, hospital days, biochemical indices and the need for transfer to hemodialysis. Both forms of creatinine kinetics (weekly creatinine clearance, EN) were able to differentiate between the G, I, and P outcome groups (P &lt; 0.05). The weekly uea Kt\/V was able to differentiate between the G and P groups (P &lt; 0.05) but not between the I and the other two outcome groups. Both urea and creatinine kinetics predict clinical outcome in CAPD. However, creatinine kinetics may be a more sensitive predictor. The efficacy number was just as sensitive as creatinine clearance in predicting clinical outcome yet simpler to gather the data for its calculation.","1143":"Four ventilator dependent infants on PD for acute renal failure underwent pulmonary function (PFT) evaluation at varying times in the PD cycle. Mid dwell peak intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) correlated with a significant decrease in pulmonary compliance and increase in air way resistance. This further correlated with a decrease in PO2 and an increase in PCO2 on arterial blood gas analysis. Etiology of the PFT changes appear to correlate most closely with IPP yet other factors including pulmonary artery shunting as well as hypercapnea secondary to a 4.25% dialysate are being evaluated as additional causative factors.","1144":"We studied morbidity in 648 patients treated in our center in a ten-year period as indicated by duration of hospitalization: 232 patients were on CAPD, 188 on hemodialysis (HD) and 228 had cadaveric kidney transplants (Tx). Duration of hospitalization was divided into four groups according to its causes. The age of the patients on CAPD was 61 +\/- 14 years, 53 +\/- 17 on HD and 36 +\/- 10 in the Tx group. The total follow-up was 629 patient-year (p-y) on CAPD, 458 p-y on HD and 928 p-y on Tx. The first admission was longer on CAPD (30 +\/- 18 days) and on Tx (36 +\/- 18 days) than on HD (18 +\/- 12). After the first admission, the total days of hospitalization (days\/patient-year, d\/p-y) were more for CAPD than HD and Tx. Analysis of these data showed that the difference was due to peritonitis and to the different percentage of elderly patients in the CAPD group. With a reduction in the incidence of infectious complications (peritonitis, tunnel or exit-site), hospitalization in CAPD could be reduced to a length of time similar to that currently needed by HD and Tx patients. This can result in important cost-saving.","1145":"Peritoneal mesothelial cells and fibroblasts were co-cultured in vitro with peritoneal white blood cells (PWBC) obtained from CAPD patients, after an overnight exchange with 0.5% Dianeal or 2.5% Dianeal. Unstimulated PWBC inhibited proliferation of mesothelial cells and fibroblasts. Upon stimulation with lipoposaccharides (LPS), PWBC from the 0.5% dextrose exchange, enhanced the growth of mesothelial cells and fibroblasts, whereas when stimulated with LPS, PBWC from the 2.5% dextrose exchange increased only proliferation of fibroblasts.","1146":"The application of urea kinetics to CAPD is controversial. Additional data is presented from our recent study on this topic. Different methods of calculating KT\/V and normalized protein catabolic rate (PCRN) are compared and KT\/V is shown to be on average 6.5% higher when V is calculated by Watson's formulae instead of by body weight alone. This discrepancy increases with time. It is also shown that standard methods may overestimate KT and underestimate PCRN. KT\/V and PCRN by these different methods do not correlate with clinical outcomes. However, if V is calculated by Watson's formulae, there is a significant excess of deaths when KT\/V is under 0.5 (weekly KT\/V under 1.5). Survival curves show that neither initial KT\/V nor PCRN predict failure on CAPD.","1147":"Parenteral administration of Calcitriol is felt to be superior to oral Calcitriol in the treatment of renal osteodystrophy in chronic renal failure patients. We analyzed the results of serum calcium, phosphorus, alkaline phosphatase, and N-terminal parathormone level which are the clinical parameters of renal osteodystrophy in twenty-three chronic peritoneal dialysis patients who received varying dosages of intraperitoneal Calcitriol. The results which were analyzed at the end of one to twenty-three months revealed significant increase in serum calcium and a significant decrease in the values of alkaline phosphatase and N-terminal parathormone level.","1148":"The fast peritoneal equilibration test (PET) has been proposed as a substitute procedure for the standard PET because it is less expensive and less time consuming since fewer samples must be drawn. This study was undertaken to compare the fast and standard PETs to determine if the fast PET is a viable alternative. Fifteen patients participated in the study. Results from the standard PETs indicate 13 patients had average permeability and 2 patients had high transport. Corresponding fast PETs indicate 10 patients with average permeability, 2 patients with high transport, 1 patient had discrepancies between the D\/P ratios and drain volume, and 2 patients were noncompliant and did not complete the fast PET. We conclude that the fast PET is a valid screening tool to evaluate peritoneal membrane permeability in patients who have previously undergone a standard PET. It is cost effective and timesaving. The test is easily invalidated if patients fail to comply with instructions for the test. The fast PET is primarily useful as a screening device to determine whether permeability has changed.","1149":"The effect of fresh peritoneal dialysis (PD) solution and effluent on the generation of eicosanoids and cytokines by human peritoneal macrophages (PMO) was studied in vitro. PMO, isolated by density gradient separation from patients undergoing intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD), were incubated for 2 h with PD effluent after dwell periods of 5 to 240 min or fresh PD solution. Supplemented RPMI-1640 medium served as control. PMO were stimulated by calcium ionophore A23187 (10 M). PD solution significantly inhibited the release of prostanoids (PGE2, TXB2, 6-k-PGF1), leukotrienes (LTB4, LTC4), and cytokines (11-6, TNF) from PMO by 60 to 96% (p &lt; 0.05). Addition of A23187 increased the generation of TXB2, LTB4, and LTC4 in PD solution adjusted to pH 7.4 to 2.7 up to 28.6 times the basal level, but was ineffective in PD fluid at pH 5.2. Incubation of PMO with PD effluent of varying dwell times resulted in a rise of all assayed mediators (p &lt; 0.05). The release of IL-6 increased continuously from 80 +\/- 10 pg\/10(6) PMO (0 min dwell time) to 440 +\/- 104 pg\/10(6) PMO (4 h dwell time, mean +\/- S.E.M.). TNF generation rose from 6.0 +\/- 0.1 pg\/10(6) PMO (0 min dwell time) to 162 +\/- 54 pg\/10(6) PMO after 5 min dwell time and remained constant with effluents of longer dwell times (15 to 240 min). Exposure of PMO to PD effluents after 240 min dwell time tended to decrease the median levels of PGE2, TXB2, and 6-k-PGF1.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1150":"Possible modifications in peritoneal behaviour that can be caused by erythropoietin (EPO) treatment and\/or correction of anemia in the ultrafiltration and peritoneal diffusion were studied in 24 CAPD patients. The evolution of the patients on the medium run was also studied. The dialysate to plasma ratio, the peritoneal clearance and the mass transfer coefficient of urea and creatinine and the ultrafiltration volume were studied, baseline, after reaching the hemoglobin target, and after eight months of treatment. The group of patients developed a decrease in the dialysate to plasma ratio and in the peritoneal clearance of creatinine. After evaluating the effects of the hemoglobin and the hematocrit, we found a decrease in the dialysate to plasma ratio of urea and creatinine, and in the peritoneal clearance of creatinine. A decrease was also found in the mass transfer coefficients of urea and creatinine. An increase in the ultrafiltration was also found in the patients with hemoglobin levels higher or equal to 11 g\/dl. Those changes are reversible after turning the hemoglobin levels back to levels lower than 11 g\/dl.","1151":"To evaluate maintenance parenteral iron dextran in chronic peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients receiving erythropoietin (rHuEPO). Parenteral iron dextran was investigated in PD patients with poor response to rHuEPO and\/or side effects of oral iron. Tertiary-referral university hospital Seven ESRD patients (five males and two females) were studied. A test dose of 25 mg iron dextran was given before starting a maintenance dose. Iron dextran 100 mg was given intramuscular weekly or biweekly. Six patients received rHuEPO and one patient was on decadurabolin. Hematocrits increased significantly (p &lt; 0.01) from 29 +\/- 2% to 38 +\/- 2% and serum ferritin increased from 267 +\/- 104 to 660 +\/- 104 ng\/dl after iron dextran. Serum albumin increased from 3.1 +\/- 0.3 to 3.6 +\/- 0.2 g\/dl (p &lt; 0.05). No patient developed an anaphylactic reaction or delayed reaction. Mean duration of parenteral iron dextran treatment was 7 +\/- 1 months. Mean dose of erythropoietin was reduced significantly (p &lt; 0.05) from 119 +\/- 20 units\/kg\/week to 87 +\/- 20 units\/kg\/week before and during fifth month of iron dextran therapy. Weekly\/biweekly maintenance intramuscular iron dextran injection was effective and safe iron supplemental therapy in PD patients with poor response or side effects to oral iron. ","1152":"Anemia correction with recombinant human erythropoietin (EPO) has been suggested to have a positive effect on nutritional status by improving appetite and protein metabolism. To assess this effect growth velocity and various parameters of nutritional status of 10 children on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) were estimated at the start and one year after the correction of anemia. There was no significant improvement of growth velocity after EPO administration. Energy and protein intake, standard deviation scores of anthropometric measurements, BUN, serum creatinine, albumin, potassium, phosphorous and protein catabolic rate did not differ significantly before and after EPO administration. There was a significant correlation of protein intake and protein catabolic rate. There was no significant improvement of nutritional status and growth of children on CAPD treated with EPO, possibly because there was no evidence of malnutrition in most patients. ","1153":"Initially starting CAPD patients on EPO was concerning after hearing reports of hemodialysis patients stating that they \"may need more dialysis\". The rationale given was that with a higher hematocrit the percentage of plasma in whole blood would decrease, leading to an increase of red cell mass. This decreased plasma volume and increased viscosity would lead to a slower blood flow ultimately resulting in less efficient dialysis. Assessing CAPD patients' peritoneal efficiency was the next step. We obtained pre and post-EPO PETs and evaluated. The initial results showed that D\/P creatinine ratios were dropping as our Hcts increased, and ultrafiltration results projected an improvement. What remained unanswered was what took place over extended periods of time on EPO therapy. We examined twelve patients over a period of 27 months. Each patient received 4 exchanges per day using 1500 to 2500 volume. PET tests were performed on each patient prestudy, and at months three, six, and 25-27. Initially each patient received EPO 4000 units, 3\/week, SQ. EPO easily increased and maintained our patients' hematocrits within 12 weeks after starting the study. D\/P creatinine ratios initially dropped but as our study continued there was a return of D\/P creatinine ratios to 6% greater than baseline. One report suggests that EPO may have a direct vasoconstricting effects on blood vessels caused by the stimulation of calcium toward the cell. Vasoconstriction of the vessels would lead to a decrease in exchangeable surface area resulting in a decreased D\/P creatinine ratio.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1154":"In order to investigate the therapeutic efficacy of subcutaneously administered erythropoietin (rHuEPO) and the effects of rHuEPO-induced hemopoiesis on peritoneal transport and on cellular immune responses, we performed standardized peritoneal equilibration tests and measured T cell subsets and phytohemagglutinin (PHA)-induced interleukin-2 receptor (IL-2R) expression of PBMC by flow cytometry before and after subcutaneous rHuEPO (Eprex-, Cilag), 4000 U twice weekly, in 13 stable CAPD patients. Hct increased from 21.3 +\/- 3.4% to 30.0 +\/- 4.8% after 1 mo and to 32.7 +\/- 4.9% after 2 mon of rHuEPO. Drained volume after 4 hrs of dwell with 4.25% dialysate increased from 2,675 +\/- 204 ml to 2,807 +\/- 174 ml (P &lt; 0.05). D4\/P4 creatinine increased from 0.68 +\/- 0.07 to 0.71 +\/- 0.06 (P &lt; 0.05) and creatinine clearance from 7.57 +\/- 0.71 to 8.03 +\/- 0.63 ml\/min (P &lt; 0.05). The number of total circulating lymphocytes, T4,T8, T4\/T8 with or without PHA did not change after rHuEPO. PHA-induced IL-2R expression by PBMC as expressed by mean channel of fluorescence intensity increased from 149.8 +\/- 6.7 to 156.8 +\/- 6.1 (P &lt; 0.05). Subcutaneous rHuEPO is effective in correcting anemia in CAPD patients. rHuEPO-induced hemopoiesis is associated with increase in peritoneal creatinine and water transport and also with PHA-induced IL-2R expression. ","1155":"The major side effect of rHuEPO is hypertension, which is reported to occur in 10-75% of adult patients. The aim of the present study is to evaluate the effect of rHuEPO on blood pressure in pediatric dialysis patients. Nine CAPD patients (mean age 7.4 +\/- 3.6 years) and fourteen HD patients (mean age 13.8 +\/- 5.5 years) were treated with rHuEPO. The hematocrits increased significantly from 20.7 +\/- 1.8 to 28.3 +\/- 4.1 in HD patients and from 19.7 +\/- 2.9 to 26.7 +\/- 4.4 in CAPD patients. The final maintenance dose required to correct the anemia was 47.6 +\/- 11.7 units\/kg\/week for CAPD patients and 122.6 +\/- 75.2 U\/kg\/week foe HD patients. Six (66.6%) out of nine CAPD patients, and five (35.7%) of fourteen HD patients developed or worsened hypertension. Younger CAPD patients tended to develop hypertension. Correction of anemia was poor in two hypertension-exacerbated patients, since rHuEPO dose increase was withheld for fear of aggravating hypertension. A four-year-old girl developed hypertensive encephalopathy after 13 months of rHuEPO therapy. No difference was observed in plasma level of aldosterone or plasma renin activity. Hypertension is observed frequently among pediatric dialysis patients treated with rHuEPO therapy. Careful monitoring and management of hypertension is required, especially in the first three months of rHuEPO therapy.","1156":"Iron supplementation is usually required in patients receiving epoetin alfa. Ferrous sulfate is commonly prescribed, however many patients experience adverse gastrointestinal effects. Adverse effects may limit the amount of iron that can be prescribed, and may lead to noncompliance. Polysaccharide-iron complex (PIC) is an iron supplement containing greater amounts of elemental iron, and may produce fewer adverse effects. This study compared the efficacy and adverse effects of PIC to a historical period of treatment with ferrous iron salts to 38 dialysis patients receiving epoetin alfa. All patients were switched to PIC, and were followed for six months. The following laboratory information was recorded: hematocrit, serum iron concentration, percent transferrin saturation, total iron-binding capacity, serum ferritin concentration. Patients were given an adverse experience questionnaire at four and six months of PIC treatment. No differences in laboratory values were noted between treatments. The amount of prescribed elemental iron increased, while iron dextran use decreased during PIC therapy. Epoetin alfa doses were unchanged. Patients reported fewer gastrointestinal adverse effects at four months, however differences at six months were less striking. PIC is as effective as ferrous sulfate in sustaining erythropoiesis in patients receiving epoetin alfa. It may produce fewer adverse effects.","1157":"Treatment with rHuEpo can eliminate many symptoms that had been attributed to uremia. Repetitive punctures in children undergoing three times weekly subcutaneous (SC) rHuEpo can result in noncompliance with the therapeutic regimen. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of once weekly SC injection of rHuEpo in children with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) on CAPD. Six children (5 males, 1 female, mean-age: 6.0 years, range: 0.5 to 15.8 years) with ESRD on CAPD were treated with a regimen of rHuEpo 150 U\/Kg\/week SC for 12 weeks. All patients received oral iron supplementation. All children had improved appetite and well-being. The adolescents showed an increased ability to engage in regular activities. The hematocrit increased from 20.3 +\/- 1.2% to 31.7 +\/- 3.8% in 12 weeks. The mean weekly increase in hematocrit was 0.95 +\/- 0.34%. There was no significant differences in iron indice prior to and during rHuEPO treatment. Side effects related to rHuEpo included transient pain at the site of injection in all, pruritus at the site of injection in 1 child, hyperphosphatemia in 1 infant, iron relative deficiency in 2 children and an asymptomatic increase in blood pressure in 1 hypertensive child. None of the 5 normotensive patients developed hypertension. We concluded that once weekly 150U\/kg SC rHuEpo is effective in correcting anemia in children on CAPD. This regimen results in few side effects, decreases the cost of treatment and produces less distress to the patients by avoiding repetitive injections.","1158":"Hemodynamic response to treatment with erythropoietin has been analyzed on two different groups of patients. The first group of 25 patients was treated with hemodialysis. The second group of 27 was treated with peritoneal dialysis. Both groups were studied before starting the treatment with erythropoietin, after reaching the hemoglobin target point, and after one year of treatment. The following parameters were recorded: basal and hemoglobin target point, time and dosage of response, incidence of arterial hypertension, diastolic and systolic left ventricular diameters, interventricular septum and posterior wall thickness, ejection fraction, fractional fiber shortening, left ventricular mass index, cardiac output index and peripheral resistance index. The incidence of hypertension was 28.8% and, in both techniques, stabilization of left ventricular mass index occurred a year later. When the hemoglobin target point was reached, a decrease in cardiac output and an increase in peripheral resistance was found. These changes were more evident in the group of patients treated with HD. After a year of treatment, both peripheral resistance and cardiac output were similar to basal values in both groups of patients.","1159":"Acute peritoneal dialysis in unstable infants is at times plagued by early catheter malfunction secondary to omental plugging in both rigid acute catheters and conventional Tenckhoff catheters. This problem is inherent to the design of catheters using sideports for outflow and is enhanced by the tenacity of the omentum in this population in walling off foreign bodies. We have modified and utilized a non-luminal, channeled surgical drain for acute peritoneal dialysis in infants to avoid this problem. Five infants ranging in age from 2 days to 7 months were dialyzed acutely in a Pediatric Intensive Care Unit setting for periods ranging from 5 to 34 days utilizing this modified catheter. The infants ranged in weights from 1.96 to 8 Kg. Catheters were placed by a surgeon and peritoneal dialysis was initiated using a Y-setup. In none of the patients was there loss of catheter function secondary to omental plugging. Three patients subsequently died of their underlying illness and two recovered renal function. Two acute catheters were subsequently changed to conventional Tenckhoff catheters when it became apparent that dialysis would need to be performed for a prolonged time. The acute catheter which was used has a four channel cloverleaf appearance when cut in cross section with no central lumen. There is a transition to a luminal catheter outside the peritoneal cavity. The advantage of the cloverleaf configuration is the ability to exchange fluid along its entire intraperitoneal length, thereby excluding a defined area of catheter sideports where omentum can occlude the system causing a ball valve phenomenon.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1160":"Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was selected and introduced as a primary dialysis method in two infants with cardiac failure. CAPD was started at 14 days after birth with body weight of 2125 gm and at 7 months of age with body weight of 2325 gm. In both cases, cardiac failure was due to large ventricular septal defect (VSD) and renal failure was due to dysplastic kidneys. In the first case (case 1), direct closure of atrial septal defect and patch closure of VSD were successfully completed at 9.5 months of age with body weight of 4844 gm. CAPD has been managed well for 1 year and 8 months and the child reached a body weight of 8440 gm. In the second case (case 2), CAPD was managed well for 11 months with body weight increasing to 4920 gm at the age of 1 year and 7 months. This marked deterioration of this boy's physical growth was mainly caused by the delay in introducing CAPD and partly due to his cardiac dysfunction which has not been corrected surgically. Both cases show almost normal mental development and are managed well at home. Although CAPD introduction yielded water balance and physical growth in these infants, earlier introduction of CAPD may result in better clinical outcomes including management following open heart surgery. Selection of CAPD as a primary dialysis maneuver is strongly recommended for uremic infants with cardiac failure.","1161":"This is a report on a pilot project integrating children with end stage renal disease (ESRD) with well children for a summer camp experience. As the teen with ESRD prepares to enter the work force and college, he\/she will have to adapt to a variety of situations that will not adapt to his\/her unique medical condition. These issues motivated a pilot project in which 9 ESRD children were mainstreamed into a 2 week, YMCA summer camp experience. Pre and post questionnaires were developed and distributed to the camper, family, and the cabin counselor along with interviews to assess the value of the experience. All the children left camp more independent and knowledgeable about their self-care. The results of this pilot project indicate that children with ESRD can adapt to their environment and increase independence, self-care and self-esteem through supervised mainstreamed experiences.","1162":"Human polymorphonuclear granulocytes (PMN) were tested for migration and phagocytosis after exposure to CAPD solutions and effluents sampled during the first hour of dialysis from patients treated with lactate or bicarbonate based CAPD-solutions. The effluents from the lactate based solutions (Dianeal and Lockolys) reduced the migration and enhanced the phagocytosis compared to values obtained in a standard cell culture medium. Both cell functions increased during the dialysis period. In contrast, the cell-function only changed slightly when 87b, a bicarbonate based CAPD-solution (pH = 7.4, [HCO3-) = 29mM), was employed. During the first 30 minutes, the cells performed at a higher level when exposed to the 87b effluent than when exposed to the lactate effluents. The observations further indicated that optimal conditions for PMNs are at a bicarbonate concentration of less than 20 mM and a lactate concentration of less than 15mM. PMN migration is reduced by both lactate and bicarbonate based CAPD solutions and effluents collected during the first hour of dialysis. The bio-compatibility of CAPD solutions may be improved by combining the lactate and bicarbonate buffering systems in a solution with a concentration of less than 20 mM of bicarbonate and less than 15 mM of lactate. ","1163":"During the period 1986-1990, 119 patients were enrolled in the Italian Registry of Pediatric CPD. CAPD was largely predominant in the first 3 years, while CCPD accounted for 48% of dialysis months in the period 1989-1990. The connect-disconnect system was a Y set for all patients during the whole observation period. The incidence of peritonitis decreased from 1 episode: 10.9 patient-months in 1986 to 1:19.8 in 1988, and then passed to 1:16.2 in 1990. A comparison of the incidence of peritonitis between CAPD and CCPD, referring to the 1989-1990 period, showed no significant difference. The percentage of positive peritoneal fluid cultures changed from 48% in 1986 to 73% in 1990. Gram-positive bacteria, primarily Staphylococcus aureus and Staphylococcus epidermidis, accounted for most of the isolated organisms. Candida albicans was cultured in 3 cases both in 1986 and 1987. Exit site infection was the predominant (82%) complication, followed by leakage and catheter cuff extrusion. The hospitalization rate for peritonitis resulted persistently high (61% of episodes) and the mean duration was 12.7 days. Of the 8 patients who were switched to hemodialysis, 4 had recurrent peritonitis and 1 Candida albicans peritonitis.","1164":"The results of the first 5 years' experience of the Italian Registry of Pediatric Chronic Peritoneal Dialysis (CPD) (1986-1990) are presented. Patients of less than 15 years of age at start of dialysis were enrolled and clinical data collected until the age of 19. The number of the dialysis centres participating in the Registry increased from 7 in 1986 to 15 in 1990. The total number of patients on CPD was 119, the number of new patients per year ranged from 15 to 28 and the percentage of all dialysed children treated with CPD increased from 40% in 1986 to 49% in 1990. The age of patients at start of CPD was 8.5 +\/- 4.9 years and 16% of them were under 2 years. Only CAPD was utilized in 1986, while CCPD\/NPD accounted for 53% and 65% of the treated patients in 1989 and 1990, respectively. At 4 years, patient survival was 91.3% and technique survival 79.3%. A comparison between data of 48 patients on CPD and 34 on hemodialysis, who started dialysis in the period 1989-1990, showed that CPD was the most frequent form of initial therapy (56%) and was the treatment of choice for children younger than 4 years.","1165":"To evaluate the characteristics of peritoneal kinetics in the young, we investigated solute and water transfer rates by a modified Peritoneal Equilibration Test (PET) in 20 pediatric patients aged 1.9 to 19.8 years. 1000 ml\/m2 body surface area of a 2.3% glucose PD solution were instilled in the peritoneal cavity. Glucose, creatinine, urea, sodium, potassium and phosphate were measured in the dialysate (D), 7 times during 4 hours and in plasma (P) after 2 hours dwell time. At 4 hours, the mean (+\/- SD) D\/P ratio was 1.06 +\/- 0.16 for urea, 0.79 +\/- 0.14 for creatinine, 0.82 +\/- 0.21 for potassium, 0.92 +\/- 0.04 for sodium and 0.79 +\/- 0.30 for phosphate. Mean D\/D0 of glucose was 0.36 +\/- 0.13. The 4-hour solute equilibration curves were analytically best approximated by logarithmic functions for urea (mean R2 = 0.983), creatinine (R2 = 0.973) and potassium (R2 = 0.979), by a linear function for phosphate (R2 = 0.964), and by an exponential model for glucose (R2 = 0.969). The linear or exponential regression coefficients were used to express the peritoneal solute transfer rates. Although the transfer rates of most solutes were correlated with each other, the individual variation of peritoneal permeability for different solutes was high. Close associations were observed between the glucose and creatinine transfer rates (r = 0.91, p &lt; 0.0001) and between ultrafiltration rate and glucose (r = -0.90, p &lt; 0.0005) and creatinine (r = -0.88, p &lt; 0.005). Peritoneal permeability for all solutes tended to be inversely correlated with body size (urea transfer rate vs. height: r = 0.49, p &lt; 0.05).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1166":"During the period from June 1985 to December 1991, 48 children were treated with continuous peritoneal dialysis (CPD) in our centre because of acute renal failure. The median age was 1.8 years (range 0.01-17.1). The most common diagnoses were: hemolytic uremic syndrome (n = 22), anuria after cardiac surgery (n = 7), and septicemia with multiorgan failure (n = 7). Kidney function recovered in 35 (73%); 13 (27%) died of their original disease. One further patient with HUS recovered from dialysis but died of cerebral complications shortly afterwards. One patient remained anuric and requires renal replacement therapy. Hyperkalemia, when present initially, and uremia could be controlled adequately in all cases. However, ultrafiltration posed problems when cardiac output was low. Peritonitis occurred in 11 patients; in 8 children the Tenckhoff catheter had to be revised because of leakage (5), flow problems (2), or bowel perforation (1). CPD proved to be an excellent method to treat acute renal failure in children of all age groups. The rate of complications was acceptable.","1167":"Nightly intermittent peritoneal dialysis (NIPD) is an automated form of intermittent peritoneal dialysis which has potential medical and psychosocial advantages in comparison with CAPD\/CCPD due to the lack of daytime exchanges. Data on solute\/water removal in children on NIPD are nevertheless scarce, so that no clear indications for NIPD can yet be formulated in pediatric age. For this reason, 12 patients, mean age 10.49 +\/- 5.81, mean body weight 23.73 +\/- 10.92, with a residual creatinine clearance 1.70 +\/- 2.30 ml\/min\/1.73 sqm, on NIPD for 14.7 +\/- 5.4 months, underwent clearance studies over 3 days. Mean dialysis infusion volume was 460.08 +\/- 196.30 ml\/kg\/day, with 10.33 +\/- 1.22 h dialysis time. Peritoneal creatinine and urea clearances were 6.36 +\/- 2.96 and 8.49 +\/- 3.35 1\/day\/1.73 sqm, respectively. Combined creatinine and urea clearances averaged 6.12 +\/- 2.21 and 6.96 +\/- 2.16 ml\/min\/1.73 sqm, resulting in serum creatinine and urea values of 7.78 +\/- 1.90 and 115.58 +\/- 29.93 mg\/dl, respectively. Ultrafiltration rate was 16.94 +\/- 16.34 ml\/g glucose absorbed. NIPD provided similar or improved solute and water clearances compared with those reported in children and adults on CAPD\/CCPD, without inconvenient long periods in bed. These data indicate that NIPD is a suitable treatment in pediatric end-stage renal disease.","1168":"Data on the micronutrient (vitamin and trace mineral) requirements of children on chronic peritoneal dialysis is limited. Few preparations are of suitable content and palatability. In a prospective study we have assessed and compared the serum levels and dietary intakes of micronutrients (vitamins A, E, B12, folate and zinc, copper, iron) in 7 children on CCPD who were receiving either Ketovite tablets (vitamins C, E and B complex) and Cholecalciferol or a more comprehensive supplement, Paediatric Renal Seravit (vitamins A, E, D, C and B complex with trace minerals). All children received nutritional supplements orally or via a gastrostomy button. These supplements contributed significantly to their nutritional intakes. The mean dietary intakes of the studied micronutrients, with the exception of vitamins A, E, B12 and folate, were below RDA (USA) values. The Renal Seravit was tolerated by only 5 of the 7 patients. There was no significant difference in serum levels of the micronutrients while on the Paediatric Renal Seravit compared to Ketovite. Serum iron levels remained low on both supplements. A comprehensive micronutrient supplement may still be required in children on prolonged dialysis.","1169":"The promotion of growth in infants and young children with chronic renal failure (CRF) requires an aggressive approach to feeding, often in combination with early dialysis. Supplementary feeding has usually involved the use of nasogastric tubes, but these can have many problems. We report our experience with a gastrostomy button device (Bard Ltd.) for long term feeding. Ten children (7 male) had an initial gastrostomy catheter inserted at a median age of 2.0 years (range 0.25-8.5 years). None of the children required an operation for gastrooesophageal reflux and 6 had placement of the gastrostomy catheter at the time of insertion of the Tenckhoff catheter for continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis (CCPD). The catheter is usually exchanged for a similar sized (18 gauge) button device after 4 weeks. All ten children received CCPD in addition to overnight feeding using an enteral feeding pump. The buttons have been in use for a mean of 12 months (range 2-33 months) and are only changed if the anti-reflux valves fail. Nutritional goals have been achieved and growth parameters maintained or improved in 9 children. The button has many advantages over nasogastric tubes or gastrostomy catheters. It has been welcomed by our families in reducing the stress of feeding these young children.","1170":"Peritonitis and exit-site tunnel infection are frequent causes of CAPD drop out. We studied 9 patients, 8 treated by CAPD and 1 by IPD. These patients underwent sonographic and scintigraphic study of the abdomen. All scintigraphic examinations showed a visceral uptake. In two cases, sub-clinical bowel inflammation, demonstrated by scintigraphic study, preceded a gram negative peritonitis. The scintigraphic study with radiolabelled white blood cells may be useful in identifying chronic aseptic inflammations and some bowel and exit-site conditions which are possible risk factors in some cases of peritonitis.","1171":"To compare the effects of low-calcium and high-calcium dialysate in stable ESRD patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). Dialysate containing 2.5 mEq\/l and 3.5 mEq\/l calcium in combination with oral calcium salts as phosphate binders were evaluated. Tertiary-referral university hospital. Fifteen patients (6 male, 9 female) on low-calcium (2.5 mEq\/l) and 15 patients (6 male, 9 female) on high-calcium (3.5 mEq\/l) dialysate were studied for 6 months. All patients received calcium acetate or calcium carbonate to control hyperphosphatemia before the study. Serum calcium, phosphorus and albumin did not differ before and after between the two groups. Three patients in low-calcium and five in high-calcium group developed hypercalcemia. Three in low-calcium group and four in high-calcium group required sucralfate to control hyperphosphatemia and hypercalcemia. Mean dose of elemental calcium was 1152 mg\/day in low-calcium group and 790 mg\/day in high-calcium group. A negative correlation (r = -0.82, p &lt; 0.005) was observed between serum calcium and PTH at the end of study period in the low-calcium group. No such relationship was observed in the high-calcium group. Degree and frequency of hypercalcemia appeared similar with low-calcium and high-calcium dialysate in peritoneal dialysis patients. ","1172":"Using a mouse model of chronic renal failure (CRF), the possibility of using lovastatin to treat hypercholesterolemia associated with CRF was examined. Renal failure was induced in 5 week-old, C57BL\/6J mice by electrocoagulation of the right kidney surface followed by left nephrectomy 2 weeks later. Five weeks post-nephrectomy, BUN and serum total cholesterol levels were assessed and lovastatin treatment commenced. Upon sacrifice 4 weeks later, BUN, serum total cholesterol levels and hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity were measured. Results showed that CRF induced significant increases in serum total cholesterol levels and enzyme activity. Treatment with lovastatin led to a dose-dependent reduction in serum total cholesterol levels without affecting the enzyme activity. These results suggest that the hyper-cholesterolemia in CRF is partly due to an increase in de novo cholesterol synthesis in the liver and that the lipid-lowering effect of lovastatin is mediated by an action other than the direct reduction of hepatic HMG-CoA reductase activity.","1173":"CAPD is considered a risk factor for low turnover bone disease. This was previously attributed to aluminum accumulation. We evaluated by biochemical and histomorphometric parameters (including double tetracycline labelling), 26 patients maintained on CAPD for 12-14 months. Three (11.5%) showed mild hyperparathyroidism, 5 (19.2%) osteitis fibrosa, 3 (11.5%) mixed forms, 4 (15%) osteomalacia and 11 (42.3%) adynamic bone disease. Only one patient with diabetes mellitus showed an aluminum stained bone surface &gt; 10%. Intact PTH serum levels were lower in LTBD (133.2 +\/- 128 vs 468.2 +\/- 451 pg\/ml; p &lt; 0.05). We also evaluated prospectively 11 patients who underwent a bone biopsy at start of dialysis and after 12 months of CAPD treatment. Bone biopsies pre CAPD demonstrated normal-high bone turnover disease in 8\/11 (72.7%) and low turnover bone disease in 3\/11 (27%). In the follow-up biopsies, 2 patients showed osteitis fibrosa and other two mild forms. Low turnover bone disease was found in 7 patients (3 osteomalacia and 4 adynamic bone disease). We conclude that the predominant bone lesion in our CAPD patients is low turnover bone disease, predominantly adynamic forms, and aluminum does not seem to play a role on its genesis. Low intact PTH serum levels may be a predictor of low turnover bone disease.","1174":"Serial lipid profiles of 102 patients starting chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) in our renal unit from January 1985 to December 1990 were collected retrospectively. Transient triglyceride elevation was noted during the first two years of CAPD but declined to normal levels even lower than those at baseline by 60 months. Total cholesterol, HDL and LDL cholesterol levels did not change significantly. Lipid-lowering agents were begun in 17 patients before initiating CAPD, 5 of whom achieved lipid profiles warranting cessation of therapy. Five other patients started treatment while on CAPD. No statistical difference in patient mortality was found when patients hyperlipidemic at the initiation of CAPD were compared to their normolipemic counterparts. We conclude that the return to normal plasma triglyceride levels after transient triglyceride elevation during long-term CAPD implies that adaptative mechanisms of triglyceride production in response to chronic glucose overload may ensue.","1175":"The peritoneal clearance (Kp) and renal clearance (Kr) of beta 2 microglobulin (beta 2 m) were studied prospectively on 50 ESRD patients treated with CAPD, in order to determine the effect of the number of daily exchanges on Kp and to investigate the factors which influence the serum levels of beta 2m. Kr and Kp of beta 2m and creatinine (Cr) were calculated using standard formulae at the initiation of study and again at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months by collecting 24 hour urinary output and dialysate effluent. Kp of beta 2m of patients on 3 exchanges\/day was .94 +\/- .08 ml\/min at the initiation of study and 1.1 +\/- .08 at the end. For patients on 4 exchanges\/day it was .99 +\/- .14 ml\/min and 1.1 +\/- .12 respectively. There was no significant difference. Serum levels of beta 2m were lower on patients with significant residual renal function (RRF) (17 +\/- .9 mg\/L) than on patients without RRF (38 +\/- 2 mg\/L. p = .001). Serum levels of beta 2m correlated inversely with Kr of Cr and beta 2m at the initiation of study and at the end (r = .67 and .77 respectively, p = .0001). We conclude that serum levels of beta 2m correlate inversely with Kr of Cr and are expected to rise as RRF decreases. The combined peritoneal and renal excretion of beta 2m is less than its daily production. The number of dialysis exchanges does not influence Kp of beta 2m.","1176":"We studied calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg) mass transfer (MT) in 10 and lactate balance in 5 CAPD patients using standard dialysis solution [(ST) (Ca 1.75 mmol\/l; Mg 0.75 mmol\/l; lactate 35 mmol\/l)] and with reduced Ca\/Mg, high lactate solution [(LC) (1.25 mmol\/l; 0.25 mmol\/l; 40 mmol\/l respectively)]. Exchanges were performed with 1.36% and 3.86% glucose solutions. MT was calculated as mmol\/exchange. Ca MT was +0.96 and +0.39 with ST 1.36% and 3.86% glucose respectively. Serum ionised Ca (iCa++) levels were less than fluid Ca during these exchanges. With LC 1.36% glucose it was -0.66 when ICa++ was more than dialysate Ca, but +0.66 when iCa++ was less than dialysate Ca. Ca MT was negative with LC 3.86% glucose irrespective of iCa++ levels. All patients were hypermagnesaemic (mean 1.24 mmol\/l. Mg MT was +0.21 and -0.04 with ST 1.36% and 3.86% glucose respectively and -0.62 and -1.13 with LC 1.36% and 3.86% glucose respectively. The difference between mean lactate gain and bicarbonate loss was less (-0.4) during exchange with LC 1.36% glucose. Mean plasma TCo2 and plasma pH did not differ between ST and LC solutions. We conclude that reduced Ca\/Mg, high lactate solutions should reduce hypercalcaemia\/magnesaemia and maintain a better acid base balance in CAPD patients who may require Ca\/Mg containing phosphate binders.","1177":"Twelve patients (median age 44.5 years) on CAPD, who had previously used a dialysate calcium concentration of 1.75 mmol\/l (for a median time of 11.5 months) were started on a low calcium dialysate (LCD) with a calcium concentration of 1.25 mmol\/l and followed up for 24 weeks. During the first eight weeks, no changes in the doses of oral phosphate binders were made and serum ionized calcium decreased from 1.30 +\/- 0.02 (mean +\/- SE) mmol\/l to 1.17 +\/- 0.02 (p &lt; 0.0001) and serum PTH (1-84) rose from 68 (median, range 16-397) ng\/l to 147 (70-449, p = 0.005). After week 8, increasing doses of calcium carbonate were used to achieve target calcium levels of 1.20-1.30 mmol\/l. No aluminum-containing binders were used. Calcium carbonate doses were increased from 2.3 (median, range 0.75-12) g\/d to 6.8 (3.8-15.0, p = 0.0004) and serum phosphorus concentrations decreased from 2.00 mmol\/l (median, range 1.25-2.67) at 8 weeks to 1.61 (1.18-2.39) at 24 weeks (p = 0.023). Serum intact PTH(1-84) values remained elevated despite the gradually increasing serum calcium concentrations. Hypercalcemia was recorded in 20\/36 (56%) of blood samples during a period of four weeks before the start of LCD, and such episodes were observed in 15\/89 (17%) of samples (p &lt; 0.001) on LCD during the period when calcium carbonate doses were increased. It is concluded that on LCD 1) the number of episodes of hypercalcemia was markedly reduced, 2) higher calcium carbonate doses could be used, and thus 3) the control of serum phosphorus improved.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1178":"CAPD results in continuous peritoneal transfer of hormones and minerals involved in the pathogenesis of renal osteodystrophy (RO). Moreover, although CAPD patients seem to have better control of serum phosphate concentration than hemodialysis patients, the need for aluminum-containing phosphate binders (ACPB) may still be present. In a prospective study meant to investigate the evolution of RO, we obtained 79 bone biopsies in 29 uremic patients (20 male, 9 female; age 25-59, mean 46). Of these, 22 were obtained at the beginning of treatment, 24 after 24 months, 23 after 36 months and 10 after 60 months. All patients were treated with CAPD (Viaflex, Baxter 2-2.5 L x 4-5 bags\/day; Ca(++) + 3.5, Mg(++) 1.5 mEq\/L) as the first modality of therapy and received oral calcitriol, aluminum hydroxyde and\/or calcium carbonate and magnesium hydroxyde in order to maintain serum calcium (Ca) and phosphorus within the normal range. Qualitative bone histology, bone Ca and magnesium (Mg) (Flame atomic absorption spectroscopy) and aluminum (Al) concentration (Graphite furnace atomic absorption spectrometry) were determined. CAPD achieves a good control of RO as indicated by the tendency toward a decreased incidence of mixed osteodystrophy and predominant hyperparathyroid bone disease and improvement of osteoid lesions. A defective Ca content of bone is persistent in the observed period and positively correlated to bone Mg concentration. An increased level of Al was shown in the serum and bone. The highest bone Al content was found among patients with predominant osteoid bone disease. Also in CAPD, patients consuming ACPB are at risk of bone Al accumulation despite the low Al levels in the dialysate.","1179":"Changes in 10 metabolic parameters (body weight, blood hemoglobin, and serum albumin, urea, creatinine, cholesterol, triglycerides, potassium, calcium and phosphorus) were compared in 28 episodes of routine peritonitis and 27 episodes of persistent peritonitis. These infections occurred in 20 CAPD patients, all of whom acquired both types of peritonitis on separate occasions. Coagulase-negative staphylococci predominated in the routine infections, while Staphylococcus aureus and Gram-negative bacilli, especially Pseudomonas, were associated with persistent peritonitis. Decreases during infection were significantly larger in persistent as compared with routine peritonitis episodes for all 10 nutritional parameters. Time required for recovery of all nutritional variables except serum potassium and urea was significantly longer in the persistent episodes. Persistent peritonitis led to peritoneal catheter loss in 13 of the 27 episodes and was associated with 4 deaths, while routine peritonitis was associated with neither catheter loss nor death. In contrast to routine peritonitis, persistent CAPD peritonitis is associated with severe malnutrition, considerable morbidity, and mortality.","1180":"Several alterations of growth hormone (GH) secretion have been described in patients with chronic renal failure. The effect of chronic treatment with recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) on GH secretion in uremic patients undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is not known. The purpose of this study was to assess the GH responses to both direct and hypothalamic stimuli in CAPD patients chronically treated with rHuEPO. Eight clinically stable and well-nourished patients (age 19-59 yr) treated with subcutaneous rHuEPO, 96.5 +\/- 72.1 U\/kg\/week, during 6-25 months were tested with GH-releasing hormone (GHRH, 100 micrograms iv in bolus). Insulin-induced hypoglycemia (0.1 U\/kg iv in bolus) and clonidine (0.15 mg\/m2 po) were used as indirect stimuli for GH release. Baseline concentrations of insulin-like growth factor I (IGF I) concentration was also determined. Five CAPD patients matched for age and sex and not previously treated with EPO were studied as a control group. There was no statistically significant difference in baseline IGF I concentrations in EPO treated patients in comparison with control group (2.6 +\/- 0.7 vs 0.9 +\/- 0.3 U\/ml). GHRH administration was followed by a GH release in the treated group that did not differ significantly from that obtained in controls (peak: 10.6 +\/- 3.7 vs 15.2 +\/- 7.8 micrograms l, area under the curve [AUC]: 16.3 +\/- 5.6 vs 24.0 +\/- 11.4 micrograms.h\/l).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1181":"In order to determine the long-term effects of continuous peritoneal dialysis on weight, 100 consecutive patients entering our program in 1988 were studied and followed for a maximum of 36 months. All patients underwent monthly evaluations including weight and biochemical surveys. Peritoneal equilibration tests were performed in 75 patients. A definite and significant trend was noted for weight gain during the first 17 months with a mean weight gain of 6.41 +\/- 8.36 kg or 6.4% increase (p &lt; 0.01). This was followed by a downward trend with a nadir on month 21 (p &lt; 0.05). There were no significant differences in the change in weight for small or large patients. A positive correlation was noted between weight change and D\/P creatinine at 12 and 24 months. Albumin concentrations remained stable throughout the period of observation. Serum albumin did not correlate with percent weight change nor with D\/P creatinine. The frequency of peritonitis did not influence weight change in this population. The data suggest that there is marked interpatient variation, but the majority of patients on chronic peritoneal dialysis experience significant weight gain upon initiation of therapy. The trend is reversed after approximately 1.5 years of therapy raising the question of underdialysis due to loss of residual renal function or from patient selection after transfer of the healthier patients to transplantation and\/or hemodialysis.","1182":"The effect of simvastatin on serum total and HDL cholesterol and total triglyceride levels in 20 hypercholesterolemic patients on CAPD treatment was studied. The drug was given at the initial dose of 10 mg\/day which was doubled up to 40 mg\/day. Two non-compliant patients stopped the drug in the first week of treatment. One patient had vomiting and stopped simvastatin. One patients reduced the dose from 20 to 10 mg\/day because of increase in CPK level. The study was completed in 16 patients. Serum cholesterol decreased from 318 +\/- 39 to 208 +\/- 34 mg\/dl (p &lt; 0.001), triglyceride from 317 +\/- 129 to 278 +\/- 160 mg\/dl and HDL cholesterol from 43 +\/- 13 to 35 +\/- 11 mg\/dl. The effective does was 10 mg\/day in 4 cases, 20 mg\/dl in 7 and 40 mg\/dl in 5. In CAPD patients, simvastatin is safe and effective in lowering serum cholesterol. The clinical significance of the decrease in HDL cholesterol and its possible effect on clinical outcome are still unknown.","1183":"To study exit-site\/tunnel infections and catheter outcomes in peritoneal dialysis patients. The study was designed to investigate exit-site (ESI)\/tunnel infections (TI) and catheter losses in all chronic PD catheters inserted in ESRD patients from 9\/88 to 9\/91. Tertiary-referral university hospital. Seventy-three patients (40 males, 33 females) underwent 78 double-cuff coiled swan-neck catheter implantations surgically. The curettage of exit site was performed weekly for tunnel infection refractory to medical management. The subcutaneous cuff was excised in persistent ESI\/TI. Fifty-nine episodes of ESI\/TI in 34 patients were observed over 946 patient-months. Thirty-nine patients experienced no ESI\/TI, 27 patients had one and seven had two or more episodes of ESI\/TI. Four patients had five episodes of peritonitis associated with ESI\/TI. Eight recurrent episodes of ESI\/TI with S. aureus in 8 patients were treated successfully with Rifampin. Seven subcutaneous cuffs were excised successfully in 7 patients with tunnel infection, five with S. aureus and two with Pseudomonas aeruginosa. No catheter was removed due to ESI\/TI or ESI\/TI associated peritonitis. Aggressive exit site care including repeated curettage, excision of the subcutaneous cuff and appropriate antibiotics reduced significantly catheter losses related to ESI\/TI. ","1184":"We hypothesize that the swan neck catheter for peritoneal dialysis with exit in the presternal area will have better exit site healing and a decreased incidence of exit site infection than currently used peritoneal dialysis catheters with the exit located on the abdomen. The chest is a very stable structure, with minimal wall motion, especially of the upper chest and over the sternum. Hence, a catheter exit located on the chest will be subjected to only minimal movement. Decreased piston like movement of the catheter at the exit site reduces inward transfer of outer microbial flora. Moreover, a tight garment is usually not worn on the chest and there is less pressure on the exit. Based on this rationale a new catheter (swan neck presternal) has been designed. The presternal peritoneal dialysis catheter is composed of two flexible (silicon rubber) tubes joined through a titanium connector at the time of implantation. The device has been dubbed as a \"bath tube\" catheter because, with the exit on the chest, a patient may take a tub bath without the risk of exit contamination due to submersion. Two such catheters were implanted in two patients. One patient had multiple problems (including chronic exit site infection) with a previously implanted swan neck Missouri 2 catheter, the other patient was originally rejected as a peritoneal dialysis candidate due to extreme obesity. Both catheters healed well in 6 weeks and the exits have not become infected during the first 8 months. These preliminary experiences with 2 catheters support the rationale of their design.","1185":"A number of systems and devices have been developed to reduce peritonitis in CAPD patients. One of the newer developed systems in the UV-Flash. A retrospective study was conducted in five Japanese hospitals to measure the efficiency of the UV-Flash system in reducing the peritonitis rate for CAPD patients. This study took place between January 1983 to January 1992. The UV-Flash system had a significantly lower peritonitis rate (1\/46.6 patient months) compared to the Standard system (1\/27.5), but showed nominal significance when compared to the Disconnect system (1\/47.6). Due to the lack of differentiation in peritonitis rates between the UV-Flash and Disconnect system, patient types for both systems were analyzed. The study found more impaired patients on UV-Flash (37.2%) as opposed to the Disconnect (9.8%). These impaired patients treated on the UV-Flash system showed a significantly lower peritonitis rate (1\/27.5) when compared to the Disconnect (1\/9.7) system. The UV-Flash system proved able to achieve sufficient prevention of peritonitis in CAPD patients. Thus, this system can be successfully applied to high risk CAPD patients.","1186":"We reviewed peritonitis (P) experience of four UK units using single use Y (Freeline T.M., Baxter UK)(F) and Twinbag (Solo T.M., Baxter UK) (S) disconnect systems, which incorporate the 'Flush Before Fill' principle. We aim to show clinical achievements, in varying circumstances, in the light of previously published in vitro study results. Each unit recorded P data, i.e., rates, causative organisms, and recurrences (R) over a 12 month period (Sept 89-Aug 90). This data was then analysed by system, by unit and in total. Each unit had similar definitions for P and R, but had varying system selection criteria. Unit 1 had a fairly open criteria for F use, then became more selective at the same time as introducing S. In unit 2, F, and then S, were first choice systems for all (inc. blind diabetics). Unit 3 trains every pt. on non-disconnect System 2, then pt. choice determines if they are retained onto a disconnect system. Unit 4 had a more highly selected population. Results, expressed as episodes\/patient month, were as follows: [table: see text] We conclude that it is possible to achieve a low incidence of P, especially that caused by S. epidermidis, particularly with S. It would seem the extent is related to pt. to system selection criteria. The effects of R and ES\/TI need to be addressed.","1187":"Relapsing peritonitis is often due to bacterial colonization of the Tenckhoff catheter and may require removal of the catheter in patients on peritoneal dialysis. The efficacy of a Tenckhoff catheter decontamination procedure was examined in 9 pediatric patients aged 1.5-18 years and compared to the outcome of a historical control group. After repeated dialysate cultures had become negative and cell count was normalized (&lt; 100\/ul), intraluminal urokinase (5000 IU\/ml) and intraluminal high concentrated antibiotics (vancomycin, fosfomycin, cefotaxim) were instilled sequentially for 3 h and 1 h respectively. This procedure was performed once daily for three days. In addition, the connector was exchanged on the last day. This regimen prevented relapsing peritonitis in all study patients, whereas in the control group in 75.8% of events further relapses occurred, necessitating removal of the Tenckhoff catheter in 7\/19 (36.8%) episodes. No side effects of intraluminal urokinase were recorded in any of the patients. We conclude that intraluminal urokinase and intraluminal high concentrated antibiotics combined with connector device exchange are highly effective for prevention of further relapses of peritonitis and reduce the need for Tenckhoff catheter exchange.","1188":"Recent experiences with Y-connectors suggest that the flush-before-fill effectively reduces intraluminal infection. Periluminal infection, however, remains an important route of peritonitis (P). We have recently reported reduced P incidence with the introduction of a new access technique as described by Moncrief in which the external segment of peritoneal catheter is left implanted subcutaneously for 6 weeks before exteriorization and bag exchanges. P developed once every 14.0 patient-mos with the new access while the incidence was one episode per 10.7 mos with conventional access. Significantly fewer patients with the new access compared to those with conventional access experienced P during the observation period (p &lt; 0.01). Although the overall incidence of exit-site infection (ESI) was not different, there were significantly fewer episodes of simultaneous P and ESI with the new access (2P in 47 episodes of ESI) than with conventional access (36P in 126 ESI). While 10 of the 36 episodes of simultaneous infection in the conventional technique were caused by same organisms, none of the 2 episodes with the new access technique was caused by same organisms. The results of this study suggest that the new access technique reduces P incidence by virtually eliminating infection by the periluminal route. ","1189":"A variety of peritoneal dialysis catheters are used in clinical practice. The catheters are mainly described by their design, French number (circumference in mm) and length. However, this description does not provide information about the catheters inflow and outflow rates. We have therefore, studied flow rates of 18 adult catheters, using a uroflowmeter. Inflow rates were measured with the inflow bag 100 cm and 145 cm above the tip of the catheter, and outflow rates were measured with the flow transducer located 35 cm and 80 cm below the tip of the catheter, imitating situations where patients are sitting in a chair or laying in a bed during fluid exchanges. Ten measurements were made for each catheter at all heights. We found that catheter designs do affect flow rates. Straight catheters had statistic significantly faster inflow and outflow rates compared to curled catheters (p &lt; 0.001). Moreover, curled catheters had statistic significantly faster flow rates than Swan Neck catheters (p &lt; 0.001). The length and internal diameter of the catheter was found to be the determining factor for the differences in flow rates.","1190":"The DextroLyte II (Dex II) Peritoneal Dialysis System was designed to improve safety and convenience in dialysis therapy. Connectors introduced with this system have a threaded recessed male connector with a corresponding female counterpart. Products are provided for CAPD, Single Use Y, Long Life Y and CCPD. Safety and convenience features intended to reduce peritonitis rates and improve patient acceptance include the following: 1. Connectors with threaded male and corresponding female counterparts which provide a dual seal 2. Easy-to-break frangible which seals the solution bag until ready for use 3. A flange on the connector ensures proper hand placement by providing a safety shield to prevent contamination during connection 4. A hinged shield containing an impregnated povidone-iodine sponge easily snaps around the bag connector 5. A Quick Disconnect Clamp (QDC) provides external occlusion permitting safe disconnection for bagless techniques without opening the system 6. A standard medication port provides easy access for administration of intraperitoneal medication Results of a multicenter study performed in nine centers are as follows: Total patient participants 121 Total patient months 1207 Overall peritonitis rate 1 episode in 43 patient months We conclude that the Dex II peritoneal dialysis systems provide safe dialysis therapy as evidenced by the exceptional peritonitis rates. Patient acceptance has been excellent due to the inclusion of the safety and convenience features described.","1191":"We prospectively studied the effects of enhanced continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) on the normalized protein catabolic rate (NPCR) and Kprt\/V of two patients with zero residual renal function and marginal or below minimal HCFA values on urea kinetic modeling (Kprt\/V = 0.21). Predictable increases in NPCR (from 0.61 to 0.76 and from 0.73 to 0.81 gm\/kg\/day, respectively) were seen after two weeks of enhanced CAPD achieved by the addition of a fifth nighttime exchange by a portable, easily operable, automated device (PD-PLUS).","1192":"In order to prevent exit-site infection, we studied a new Tenckhoff-derived catheter, named the \"Malpighi catheter,\" capable of avoiding sinus tract formation. The outer cuff of this new device is 3.5 cm long and is deliberately positioned half-extruded; in fact, half of the cuff remains outside the skin exit-site. The implantation technique is identical to that of the standard two-cuff Tenckhoff catheter. We implanted eight Malpighi catheters in 5 CAPD and 3 IPD patients. The observation period was 146 patient-months (range 14-23, M +\/- SD 18.2 +\/- 3.3). We observed excellent adhesion between the outer cuff and surrounding tissue. Actually, by pulling the catheter the skin around the half-extruded cuff becomes cone-shaped, with the cone's apex tightly stuck to cuff and the sinus tract disappearing completely. Only one case of exit-site infection by Staphylococcus aureus and two cases of ulcer of the skin beneath the external part of the half-extruded cuff were observed. These complications were resolved completely. No catheter needed to be removed and there were no leakages. The histological study of the cuff showed a good infiltration of the dacron cuff by fibrous tissue. On the grounds of our preliminary experience, we believe that the absence of the sinus tract, the formation of an efficient mechanical and bacterial barrier and the reduction of exit-site infection incidence are all factors that encourage further research.","1193":"The use of a UV-box disconnect system reduces the incidence of peritonitis as compared with manual exchanges. An integrated disconnect system (IDS) also gives good results. See Figure 1. From 1988-1991, we prospectively compared two groups of patients using either a UV-box disconnect system (Baxter, n = 18, mean age 64, range 28-75 yrs) or an IDS (Baxter, n = 25, mean age 53, range 30-78). The Tenckhoff catheter had been inserted by the same technique in all patients, and the training program and nursing care were also identical. Since many younger patients preferred IDS and refused randomization, age was significantly lower in the IDS group. All peritonitis episodes (PER) were registered. Excluded from calculations of PER were episodes most probably not due to failure in connective device: PER after incidental penetration of the dialysis bags, deep penetrating tunnel infections and in the direct course of abdominal surgery. There were significantly fewer months with PER (one month = 1 PER; Chi-2 = 6.45, p &lt; 0.05) in patients using the IDS (3 PER\/269 months) compared with those using the UV-box system (15 PER\/355 months). The IDS was requested mainly by younger patients, while some older patients found it to be too complicated. The integrated disconnect system is especially acceptable by younger patients, and patients using the IDS show a low incidence of peritonitis. ","1194":"The impact of peritonitis on CAPD results was evaluated in 1990 pts (mean age +\/- SD:58.4 +\/- 14.8 yrs, 55.9% males), treated in 30 centres participating in Italian PD Study Group, during 1980-89, with an overall observation period of 3953 years (mean +\/- SD 24.1 +\/- 22.3 months). The incidence of peritonitis decreases from 1.21 (1980-84) to 0.48 (1985-89) ep\/year (overall:0.68) with a significant (P &lt; 0.001) reduction of the probability of developing the first peritonitis episode (FPE) through the same periods. The probability of developing FPE and the relative risk of peritonitis were significantly lower (P &lt; 0.001) in pts for whom CAPD has been the first treatment (80.1%); on the contrary these parameters did not gain significant difference according to sex, age 65 years, diabetes or cardiovascular disease. As far as the organisms responsible for peritonitis are concerned a significant reduction of S. epid. and an increase of S. aureus, other Gram pos. and Pseudomonas was observed in the second 5-yr periods. Peritonitis episodes caused catheter removal in 8.2% of cases and were associated with catheter infection in 10.8% of cases. Peritonitis accounted for 24.2% of hospitalization causes and for 6.7% and 30.0% of death and of drop-out respectively. The probability of death and drop-out was significantly high (p &lt; 0.001) in pts with a peritonitis incidence &gt; 1 ep\/year than in those with &lt; 0.5 ep\/year. The probability of drop-out due to peritonitis was not higher in diabetic or older patients.","1195":"This study was undertaken to ascertain the effectiveness of an immobilization device in reducing exit site infections (ESI) in CAPD patients, and whether immuno-suppressive therapy, diabetes, disconnect system and Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage had any bearing on the incidence of ESI. Sixty-six patients having a Tenckhoff catheter placement were randomly allocated into one of three groups; immobilizer, tape and non-immobilized group. The groups were monitored for the incidence of ESI over a total period of 347 patient months. The results show no significant difference in infection rates between the three groups, nor do the factors mentioned have any bearing on ESI rate. Whilst immobilization is important, the ineffectiveness of this device was probably related to its design problem.","1196":"In our previous rat studies (Kidney Int. 1991; 39: 608-617) we evaluated peritoneal clearances (Cp) representing near exclusively diffusive CO2 transfer: for isosmotic (0.37% dextrose) and hyperosmotic (15% dextrose) solutions with pH 7.2-7.3, CpCO2 were 1.20 +\/- 0.08 and 1.84 +\/- 0.04 ml\/min, respectively. In the present studies we have compared Cp of CO2 gas and HCO3- in anesthetized rats (n = 22) using solutions with dextrose contents as mentioned above but with pH 6.5 or 7.6; we have also evaluated how much Cp CO2 measurements obtained with solutions at these pH values differ from Cp shown earlier with the solutions of pH 7.2-7.3. Cp of CO2 gas and HCO3- were significantly higher under hyperosmotic than isosmotic conditions. The use of solutions of pH different from 7.2-7.3 resulted in higher Cp of CO2 gas: with isosmotic solutions of pH 6.5 and 7.6 mean increases were 25 and 75%, respectively; with hyperosmotic solutions respective increases were 45 and 134%. We conclude that dialysis solution osmolality and pH significantly change Cp of CO2 gas and HCO3- in the rat. For evaluation of peritoneal blood flow from diffusive transfer parameters of CO2 gas, smaller overestimation can be expected when dialysis solution pH is slightly under-than overadjusted compared to blood pH.","1197":"Documented viral peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis patients is rare, although up to 20% of all cases are culture negative (non-fungal, non-bacterial). CMV-infected peritoneal cells may serve as a reservoir for reinfection and\/or reactivation of CMV after renal transplantation. CMV-Polymerase Chain Reaction (CMV-PCR) amplification analysis identified CMV-DNA in cells from the peritoneal dialysate of 8 patients (3 culture negative peritonitis from a total of 5 examined) and 5 asymptomatics) out of 17 potential kidney transplant recipients (6 on IPD 16.6 +\/- 6 months, range 10-29 months; 11 on CAPD 28.1 +\/- 25 months, range 2-81 months). Serum titers (10\/17 patients analyzed) of anti-CMV IgG antibodies ranged from &lt; 1:20 to 1:320 (no correlation with CMV-DNA) while anti-CMV IgM antibodies were undetectable. Detection of CMV specific sequences in peritoneal cells in peritoneal dialysis patients by the PCR assay is sensitive (amplification of a 133 bp immediate early CMV gene sequence allows detection of 10 CMV infected cells in a background of 10(5) uninfected peritoneal cells), rapid (1 day visual, 3 days with confirmation by Southern hybridization), specific (no amplification of human embryo and kidney cell DNA, or HSV, EBV, or VZV infected cells) and is non-invasive in IPD\/CAPD patients since no additional invasive technique is required.","1198":"Staphylococcus aureus nasal carriage status (SANCS) has been recognized as a risk factor for patients on CAPD, due to a higher probability of suffering peritoneal catheter infections. The use of subcutaneous drugs (insulin dependent diabetics, drug addicts, HD patients and antiallergic vaccines), has been associated with increased risk of SANCS. On CAPD, erythropoietin (EPO) is almost universally used by the subcutaneous route. The objective of this paper was to evaluate the incidence and prevalence of SANCS in 85 CAPD patients by means of nasal smear and the influence of SANCS on peritoneal and catheter infection rate. Patients were divided in four groups according to diabetic status and EPO treatment (mean dose 2000 u. twice a week). The prevalence of SANCS in control groups was 30% in non-diabetics and 23% in diabetics. EPO treated patients showed a prevalence of SANCS of 39% in non-diabetics and 45% in diabetics due to the presence of 7 and 5 carrier patients respectively. SANCS patients (29% of the population), suffered 45% of peritonitis and 42% of exit-site infections caused by S. aureus. In a prospective part of the study, there was no difference in the frequency of developing positive cultures among EPO and control (30% of patients). No male EPO treated patients developed SANCS. We conclude that it is necessary to monitor S. aureus nasal carrier status periodically in CAPD patients especially in women. Whether or not subcutaneous erythropoietin treatment is implicated pathogenetically with SANCS, is not clarified by our data because of the frequent spontaneous appearance of SANCS among CAPD patients.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1199":"The prevalence of HIV positive patients (HIV pts) with ESRD is likely to increase and many will be going on CAPD. There are, however, factors which cause one to be concerned about a possible increased risk of peritonitis in these patients. These include not only their impaired immune and nutritional status, but often their mental status. We examined the incidence and type of peritonitis among the 184 patients who have been in our program since December 1983 for a total of 4,017 patient months (pt mo). During this time we treated 9 known HIV pts (4 drug users and 5 homosexuals) for a total of 114 pt mos. We also looked at albumin, cholesterol, and creatinine as possible risk markers. We found a greater than two fold incidence of peritonitis in the HIV positive patients and that low albumin was a significant risk factor in the HIV negative patients, but not in the HIV positive patients.","1200":"The presence of CAPD peritoneal catheters has an association with S. epidermidis infections which are relatively resistant to antibiotic therapy. This resistance has been ascribed to the formation by the bacteria of a protective matrix on the catheter surface enclosing the bacteria to form a bacterial biofilm. The rate of action of 14 antibiotics on standardized S. epidermidis bacterial biofilms over a 5 day exposure period and the modifying effects of fresh and spent peritoneal dialysis fluids were assayed. There were significant differences in the rates of antibiotic action. Fresh dialysis solution markedly augmented rifampin activity, and to a lesser extent, vancomycin, cloxacillin and teicoplanin but antagonized ciprofloxacin. Spent dialysis fluid generally augmented the activity of antibiotics, notably cloxacillin and cephalothin. Rifampin was bactericidal in both fresh and spent dialysis fluids. Fusidic acid was a poor performer in all tests.","1201":"We have studied the efficacy of topical Mupirocin for elimination of Staphylococcus aureus (Staph. aureus) nasal carriage in CAPD patients. Staph. aureus nasal carriers in our CAPD program were randomized to one of two groups: Group 1, treated with Mupirocin, and Group 2, treated with neomycin sulphate nasal ointment. The prevalence of Staph. aureus nasal colonization was 44% for patients (24\/54) and 17% for dialysis partners (5\/29). Group 1 included 11 patients and 1 partner, and Group 2, 8 patients and 2 partners. In Group 1, the eradication rate was 100%, and the recolonization rate was 0, 8, 41, 55 and 66% at 1, 2, 3, 6 and 10 months. In Group 2, the eradication rate was 40%, with a recolonization rate of 0.25 and 75% at 1, 2 and 3 months. Re-treatment with mupirocin was successful in 66% of the cases, compared to 20% for neomycin. The MIC90 of mupirocin for Staph. aureus was 0.5 mcg\/mL, with an increase to 4 mcg\/mL towards the end of the study. During the study period, there was a very low incidence of Staph. aureus peritonitis or catheter-related infections in patients treated with mupirocin. Secondary effects of mupirocin were negligible. Mupirocin is more effective than neomycin sulphate for the elimination of Staph. aureus nasal colonization in patients undergoing CAPD. Periodic re-treatment is frequently necessary, given the significant recolonization rate.","1202":"A total of 16 episodes of peritonitis in 14 patients (9 males, 5 females), were treated with Clavulanate potentiated ticarcillin (TC), a -lactamase stable parenteral penicillin. All the pts were hospitalized and received initial loading dose of 3.2 gr intraperitoneally (i.p.) in a 6-hour 1 L exchange, which was followed by four 1 L exchanges with 320 mg\/LTC. The therapy was continued for ten days. The bacteria isolated were: Staph. epid. (4), Staph. aureus (2), Strept. viridans (1), Enterococcus (1), Klebsiella Pneum. (1), Serratia (1), Enterobacter (1), Pseudomonas species: stutszeri (2), cepacia (1), fluorescens (1), negative cultures (1). Recurrence of peritonitis was seen in three patients with Pseudomonas (stutszeri (2), fluorescens (1)) peritonitis, 10-16 days after cessation of therapy. No clinical or biological side effects were seen in any patient during and\/or after the therapy. These results suggest that, i.p. monotherapy of TC is effective in the treatment of CAPD peritonitis, while in cases of Pseudomonas peritonitis more specific regimens should be used.","1203":"Imipenem\/cilastatin is a new thienamycin antibiotic with a broad bactericidal spectrum. We undertook a prospective randomised study to compare the safety and efficacy of intraperitoneal (IP) imipenem\/cilastatin (2 gm daily) [group A; 21 patients, mean age 49.2 years] with a combination of IP netilmicin and vancomycin (500 and 60-100 mg daily resp.) [group B; 20 patients, mean age 55.2 years] in CAPD peritonitis. Each patient underwent 4 daily CAPD exchanges with antibiotics in alternate exchanges. The causative organisms were similar in both the groups as was the duration of therapy (gr.A: 6.8 +\/- 0.27 days; gr.B: 7.2 +\/- 0.51 days; p = NS). Complete cure was marginally better with imipenem\/cilastatin (gr.A; 94.1%, gr.B: 83.3%) with less relapses (gr.A: 1 episode; gr.B: 3 episodes). One episode in gr.A (S. aureus) and 2 in gr.B (Yeast &amp; Proteus) failed to resolve and required catheter removal. Two gr. A patients developed generalised convulsions which settled after discontinuation of the drug. Whilst the results show no significant difference in the outcome in the two groups, the use of IP imipenem would offer a possible advantage as a single antibiotic. Larger experience is needed before imipenem can be recommended as a 'blind' first line agent for CAPD peritonitis.","1204":"The definition of a peritoneal catheter exit site infection varies from one dialysis center to another. A review of abnormal appearing exit sites (n = 334 in 169 patients) from 1\/83 to 3\/91 was done to compare outcome in exit sites presenting with erythema (39, 12%) to those with drainage plus erythema (72, 22%) or drainage alone (223, 67%). Resolution of the abnormality occurred in 48% of those exit sites with drainage, 62% with erythema and drainage, and 79% with erythema alone (p &lt; 0.005). S. aureus was present in 62% of the cultured exit sites which had erythema alone, 64% with erythema plus drainage, and 41% with drainage alone, while Gram negative rods were present in 13%, 12%, and 35%, respectively (p &lt; 0.005). Twenty-three of the 39 exit sites with erythema were not initially treated with antibiotics; 87% resolved compared with 69% of those treated immediately with antibiotics (p = ns). Seven of the 8 erythematous exit sites that did not resolve progressed to tunnel infection and\/or peritonitis and required catheter removal, despite the addition of antibiotics in the three initially untreated. Six of the 8 unresolved erythematous exit sites were due to S. aureus. These results indicate that, although drainage is the commonest exit site abnormality and has the worst prognosis, peri-catheter erythema is not always benign, representing an early sign of infection in some cases.","1205":"This study was designed to retrospectively review the experience in this center with oral ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid and ip vancomycin 25 mg\/L in the treatment of CAPD-related exit site infections and to determine the relationship between exit site infections and peritonitis. There were 48 patients with 172 episodes of infection (23 had both infections, 22 had peritonitis only, 3 had exit site infections only). Thus, exit site infections occur infrequently in the absence of peritonitis (23% of occasions). Of the 35 patients who had peritonitis as the first infection, 13 (37%) subsequently developed an exit site infection. The mean +\/- SD period from an initial peritonitis to a subsequent exit site infection in these patients was 8.2 +\/- 8.0 (range 1-28) months. Of the 22 patients with 34 exit site infections, there were 15 (44%) treatment failures, of which 10 (67%) were relapses or possible relapses. S. aureus was the most common isolate. 5% of exit site infections were culture negative. Follow-up was incomplete for many patients resulting in many instances of no further cultures, and compliance could not be assured. This combination was associated with a high incidence of treatment failures in this setting.","1206":"In a regional CAPD program in Northern Alberta, Canada, the peritonitis rates among patients undergoing CAPD treatment were quite high: 1\/8.3 and 1\/7.4 per patient month from a population of 75 and 76 patients in 1989 and 1990 respectively. Our patient population is comprised of different ethnic groups, separated widely from the dialysis centre; over half of them are above the age of 60 years. As it is not possible to change the patient characteristics in our centre, we switched to the Twin-bag disconnect system in 83 out of a total of 103 patients in 1991. With this change our overall peritonitis rate has significantly improved to 1\/14 per patient months and 1\/17 per patient months in patients using the Twin-bag system. This improvement in the peritonitis rate has occurred without any change in our patient characteristics. We find the improvement in our peritonitis rate is due to the use of the new Twin-bag system, which provides total disconnection with no spikes and thereby reduces peritonitis due to touch contamination.","1207":"Peritoneal permeability (PP), hydrostatic intraperitoneal pressure (IPP) and the overall volume of ultrafiltration (UF) were measured in 23 patients treated by CAPD under stable conditions. PP, IPP and UF were measured during the same exchange with a 2-liter bag with 3.86% glucose, dwell time of 2 hours. PP was evaluated with 3 indices: glucose peritoneal desaturation at 2 hours, urea peritoneal saturation at 2 hours, and crossing time of glucose and urea peritoneal equilibration curves. IPP was evaluated at inspiration (IPPinsp) and at expiration (IPPexp)-giving IPPmean-by measuring the height of the dialysis fluid in the PD line under atmospheric pressure, with point zero located on the axillary line of the subject in strict supine position. Net UF volume was inversely correlated with IPPmean. The net UF volume was strongly affected by IPP since a 1 cmH2O increase in IPPmean caused a decrease of 74 ml in global UF in 2 hours, probably by modification of the lymphatic reabsorption and perhaps of the transcapillary UF.","1208":"To study the influence of dialysis fluid on the antibacterial defense in the peritoneal cavity of rats, especially glucose concentration and dwell time, an experimental infection was developed. Rats were injected intraperitoneally with dialysis fluid with a glucose concentration of 1.36%, 2.27%, or 3.86% or physiological saline. Subsequently 1, 4 or 18 hr thereafter an inoculum of approximately 3 x 10(8) colony forming units of Staphylococcus aureus was administered intraperitoneally (i.p.) Next, 24 hr after the inoculation the number of viable bacteria was determined. Peritoneal cells (PC) isolated 1, 4 and 18 hr after the administration of dialysis fluid were tested for their capacity to kill S. aureus in vitro. A positive relation was observed between the glucose concentration and the number of bacteria isolated; the longer the dwell time the lower this number. In vitro PC isolated at the various intervals did not differ in their capacity to kill S. aureus. It is concluded that the glucose concentration in dialysis fluid impairs the antistaphylococcal defense in the peritoneal cavity of rats. A relatively long dwell time enhances this defense. These results cannot be explained by a lower capacity of the PC to kill S. aureus in vitro.","1209":"In this study we have investigated whether mesothelial cells (MC) and mesothelial extracellular matrix (ECM) are suitable substrates for the adherence of Staphylococci. Mesothelial cells were isolated from the peritoneal dialysis effluent by making use of their lack of Fc-receptors and capacity to attach firmly to plastic. After 10 days post-confluency the MC monolayer was removed with 0.1% Triton-X100 and the presence of an ECM shown by enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). The ELISA showed the presence of fibronectin and laminin but not of type IV collagen and vitronectin. Bacterial adherence assays with Staphylococcus aureus (N:3 isolates) adhered well to both ECM (33.4%) and MC monolayers (40.2%; ECM vs. MC monolayers p &lt; 0.03). Staphylococcus aureus adhered significantly better to both ECM (p &lt; 0.05) and MC monolayers (p &lt; 0.05) when compared to plastic. Staphylococcus epidermidis (N:3 isolates) showed similar adherence for plastic (22.1%) and MC monolayers (23.5%); mesothelial ECM was a relatively poor substrate for adherence (6.8%, p &lt; 0.03). In conclusion, results obtained sofar do not indicate an increased risk for adherence of Staphylococci when the mesothelial ECM is exposed.","1210":"Assessment of adequacy of dialysis has become a necessary part of all peritoneal dialysis programs; this task is particularly burdensome in home cycler patients. To test the hypothesis that the Peritoneal Equilibration Test (PET) reliably predicts clearance, as measured by classical clearance methodology, both CAPD and cycler patients underwent PET tests and clearance studies. In cycler patients, Dialysis to Plasma Ratios (D\/P) for urea nitrogen (UN) and D\/P for creatinine as determined by clearance methods correlated extremely well with those obtained by PET test. D\/P creatinine also correlated well (clearance versus PET) in CAPD patients; D\/P UN approached unity in all CAPD patients with dwell times of 4 hours or longer. In all cases, the PET prescription was highly accurate in predicting 24-hour clearance results. These results are useful in those patients in whom 24-hour home collections are inconvenient or impossible, especially in cycler patients.","1211":"In recent decades, non-insulin dependent diabetes mellitus (NIDDM) has become a major public health problem in several parts of the world. A complex disorder, NIDDM is associated with an increased risk of blindness, coronary heart disease, peripheral vascular disease, and kidney failure (1). The epidemiology of NIDDM is providing new insights into many aspects of this disease, including prevalence, incidence, morbidity, and mortality (2). My objective is to explain the high prevalence of a NIDDM susceptible genotype(s) in several distinct populations: American Indians, Australian Aborigines, and Pacific Islanders. The susceptible genotype may have been selected into these populations because of unusually frequent food shortages that occurred during the initial colonization of 'new worlds'. NIDDM has been shown to have a strong genetic component (3) that may include a 'thrifty' genotype(s) (4,5). The 'thrifty' genotype(s) may have once allowed founding populations to survive feast' and 'famine' conditions for several generations. With an assured food supply and a sedentary lifestyle, however, the 'thrifty' genotype(s) becomes disadvantageous, leading to obesity, increased insulin resistance, beta cell decompensation, and NIDDM (3,6).","1212":"We report an adult patient with multiple congenital anomalies including absent right arm, short stature, and scoliosis who has been trained and successfully performs continuous cycling peritoneal dialysis independently. Motivated patients with end stage renal disease and various anomalies should be considered for peritoneal dialysis training.","1213":"To compare sleep-disordered respiration in ESRD patients receiving peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. Subjective and objective measures of sleep were recorded in two groups of ESRD patients receiving PD and HD. Tertiary-referral university hospital Fifteen PD patients (12 males, 3 females) and 15 HD patients (11 males, 4 females) were studied for two nights in the sleep laboratory. Ten of the 15 PD patients and 8 of the 15 HD patients reported multiple types of sleep difficulties (NS). In the PD group, seven described substantial difficulty initially going to sleep; ten were troubled by awakenings during the night, while seven suffered from daytime sleepiness. In the HD group, seven described substantial difficulty initially going to sleep; eight were troubled by awakenings during the night, while five experienced day-time sleepiness. No significant difference was observed in total sleep time, intermittent wake time, sleep latency, sleep efficiency, total disordered breathing events, minimum oxygen saturation and periodic leg movements between the PD and HD groups. Sleep apnea was noted in 9 of 15 PD and 8 of 15 HD patients. This study indicates that the incidence and severity of sleep apnea is similar in ESRD patients receiving chronic peritoneal dialysis and hemodialysis. ","1214":"To evaluate the multiple use of cycler set with universal connector set. The study was designed to reuse the cycler set for two to three treatments, each of 16-24 hours using Pac-X or Pac-Xtra cycler and to continue to use the same set if the patient was disconnected for any reason. Tertiary-referral university hospital. 204 ESRD patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD) admitted to University Hospital from January 1989 to July 1991 were studied. The patients were disconnected and reconnected in between or during PD treatments. Five-liter dialysate bags were used. All the fluid was either set initially or added as clinically indicated. 2491 cycler PD treatments were performed with Pac-X and Pac-Xtra cyclers using 940 cycler tubing sets. 1624 disconnections were made in between and 336 were made for radiological investigations, special procedure, physical therapy and surgery during PD treatments. No episode of peritonitis or mechanical failure occurred. The multiple use resulted in 62% reduction in cycler sets thereby reducing the disposable supplies and a substantial saving in the nursing time. The multiple use of cycler set with universal connector and manifold set was safe and economical in the patients undergoing cycler PD in the hospital setting. ","1215":"Large numbers of diabetics with renal failure have been treated by continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Overall 1-year patient survival varies from 51% to 87%. Mortality is due to cardiovascular disease in more than 50% of the cases. Young diabetics with good blood pressure control and without cardiac disease have a chance at long survival on CAPD. In comparison to hemodialysis, CAPD yields better patient survival for young diabetics and worse for old diabetics, worse technique survival, probably greater overall morbidity, and similar rates of progression of retinopathy, neuropathy and peripheral vascular disease. Adequacy of peritoneal clearance and peritoneal ultrafiltration characteristics are similar between diabetics and non-diabetics on CAPD. CAPD is associated with better preservation of renal function than hemodialysis in diabetics. The rates of CAPD peritonitis do not differ substantially between diabetics and non-diabetics. However, diabetes appears to be associated with higher incidence of tunnel infection. Hyperlipidemia is generally less severe in diabetics than non-diabetics on CAPD, but malnutrition is more frequent in diabetics. CAPD has many attractive features and several drawbacks for the management of diabetics with end stage renal failure (ESRF). Its ultimate success will depend on the outcome of efforts to improve cardiovascular mortality, malnutrition, hyperlipidemia and catheter-related infections.","1216":"In order to evaluate the CNS-function of uremic patients, the magnetic activity emitted from the brain of 20 pts (10 pts on CAPD and 10 on HD) was measured. MEG consisted of taking 32 consecutive records from the 32 equally spaced points chosen on the skull in uremic pts around our reference points T3, T4, P4, F3, F4 of the international 10-20 electrode placement point system. MEG data were converted using an AD-converter with sampling frequency 256 Hz and stored in a P\/C. Our results showed significant differences between the two groups. In all HD pts there was abnormal magnetic brain activity with high spectral amplitudes (in the band 2-7 Hz) which was more prominent in pts in hemo for more than 4 years. The magnetic activity was within normal ranges in all CAPD pts. We conclude that: 1) There is high magnetic brain activity in HD pts, which in accordance with the EEG findings are signs of diffuse encephalopathy. 2) CAPD pts show a very low magnetic brain activity which must be interpreted as normal brain function, and 3) MEG can be useful in further measurement of adequacy of dialysis.","1217":"Ciprofloxacin is increasingly used to treat peritoneal dialysis related peritonitis. We studied the pharmacokinetics of intraperitoneally administered ciprofloxacin in six uninfected CCPD patients. In a randomized cross-over setting ciprofloxacin was added either to a long dwell exchange (lastbag) or to four short dwell exchanges (dwell time 1.5 h). Addition of ciprofloxacin (25 mg\/l) during the four short dwell exchanges resulted in dialysate levels of 21.1-13.3 mg\/l during these exchanges. In the subsequent last bag devoid of ciprofloxacin a dialysate Cmax,D of 1.38 mg\/l was observed at 30 min. Mean +\/- SD serum Cmax,S was 0.59 +\/- 0.29 mg\/l after 5.4 h. Instillation of 100 mg\/l ciprofloxacin in the last-bag yielded Cmax,D of 99.1 mg\/l, falling with a t1\/2 of 3.3 h towards levels &lt; 2 mg\/l at 19.8 h. A mean +\/- SD serum Cmax,S of 0.69 +\/- 0.19 was reached after 4 h. During four subsequent 1.5h exchanges without ciprofloxacin dialysate levels were &lt; 0.1 mg\/l. Instillation of 25 mg\/l ciprofloxacin in the last-bag yielded a Cmax,D of 21.7 mg\/l, falling towards levels &lt; 2 mg\/l at 15 h with a t1\/2 of 3.85 h. A mean +\/- SD serum Cmax,S of 0.26 +\/- 0.03 was reached after 8 h. We conclude that the rapid absorption of ciprofloxacin from the dialysate into the tissues requires ciprofloxacin to be administered to all CCPD bags to ensure bactericidal dialysate levels. When therapeutic serum levels are required higher intraperitoneal doses or an oral or i.v. loading dose is warranted.","1218":"The Peritoneal Equilibration Test (PET) as standardized by Twardowski (T) and simplified Mass Transfer Coefficients (MTC) as per Garred (G) and Krediet (K) have been employed in our patients to assess: 1) the reproducibility of results, 2) correlation between methods, and 3) usefulness of patient categorization by simplified methods in contrast to PET patterns. We have performed 29 standardized PET (Dianeal 2.5%) in 24 stable CAPD patients. We have collected dialysate samples at 0, 30, 60, 120, 180 and 240 minutes. With this data we were able to calculate the dialysate\/plasma ratio for PET, MTC as per Garred and MTC as per Krediet. Our results were not significantly different from data reported by the original authors, except for PET D\/P urea at 240': 0.91 +\/- 0.07(T) vs. 0.87 +\/- 0.08 (our), p &lt; 0.05. In our patients, good correlation was found between PET and MTC for urea, creatinine, and glucose, using both formulae (G and K). Patient categorization as High, High Average, Low Average, and Low by MTCs can well predict PET categorization with acceptable sensitivity and good specificity. We conclude there is good reproducibility of the methods. There is also a close correlation between PET, K and G methods for solute transport evaluation and patient categorization. Simplified methods can be substituted for the more complex ones.","1219":"Sufficient nutritional intake is important to adjust the increased catabolic rate in uremic patients during dialysis treatment. Increased glucose absorption during PD treatment may, however, interfere with the amount of muscle- and fat-mass in the body. We have therefore studied the amount of total body fat composition in 8 male PD patients (treatment period 79 months, range 3-23 before and 165.5 months, range 8-35.5 after the study). Food intake was recorded for 7 days twice in four patients with an interval of 6-8 months. Total body fat (%) was measured by means of a computerized model of near infrared interactance (IRI) (\"FUTREX\") on the dominant upper arm. The energy and protein intake were 1731 +\/- 292 kcal. and 86.9 +\/- 17.2 g (n = 4) during the first recording period of food intake. In the second period the energy and protein intake were 1676 +\/- 105 kcal and 72.7 +\/- 10.2 g (n = 4) (NS). The total body fat increased from 19.8 +\/- 2.9 to 22.5 +\/- 3.0 (p &lt; 0.05), in spite of unchanged total body weight. PD patients seem to accumulate fat during PD treatment with glucose as osmotic agent. This may influence the cardiovascular risks. The results indicate nutritional adjustments and possibly also increased physical activity. ","1220":"The adequacy of dialysis is a primary concern when caring for patients undergoing CAPD. It is also important to analyze the key factors, which will reflect on the prognosis of elderly patients on CAPD. In this study, 60 CAPD patients were examined. The peritoneal and residual renal clearance of these patients were calculated every six months. These patients were divided into three groups (G-1 = poor, G-2 = fairly good, G-3 = good) according to their clinical parameter scores using a s-albumin,Ht,LBW, and s-cholesterol level. This study showed that the values of (KT\/V) urea and Curea showed no statistical differences. These results therefore indicate that the major reason for the poor outcome in elderly patients is due to low dietary protein intake.","1221":"The formation of fibrin on peritoneal surface has been related to the appearance of adhesions both, in surgical and CAPD patients. It is known that mesothelial cells have fibrinolytic activity related with t-PA production. We studied plasma and overnight peritoneal effluent (OPE) from 20 CAPD stable patients. Antigenic PAI and t-PA were determined. These values and its correspondent peritoneal saturation indexes were compared to urea and creatinine MTCs, peritonitis incidence, UF capacity, protein losses, Pi, Ca, Na, CO2t, urea and creatinine OPE levels. Plasma t-PA 6.64 +\/- 4.68 (2.4-20); Plasma PAI-I 24.8 +\/- 17.1 (p &lt; 0.001 in respect to controls) (4-62); OPEt-PA 1.46 +\/- 0.95 (0.4-4.6); OPE PAI-I 7.3 +\/- 5.6 (0-20.4). Peritoneal saturation ratios were for t-PA 29.6 +\/- 21% (6-65) and for PAI-I 34 +\/- 32% (7-132). In conclusion our data do not support strong relationship between peritoneal t-PA\/PAI system and the functional characteristics of the peritoneal membrane although plasma PAI-I, after an increase in patients at early stages on CAPD, shows a tendency to decrease over time and frequent peritonitis. The values of peritoneal saturation ratios for t-PA\/PAI are higher than expected for their molecular weight, which suggests local production. An elevated plasma t-PA levels has been found in older patients.","1222":"A threat to survival in renal failure, malnutrition in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis patients (CAPD) is often occult as CAPD patients often gain weight masking actual protein malnutrition. Bioelectrical impedance (BEI) accurately assesses body composition in CAPD patients and uncovers subtle changes in lean body mass (LBM) that escape indirect anthropometric detection. Segregating parameters of body composition is crucial to nutritional management of CAPD patients in whom fat may account for overall weight gain. While both skin-fold methods and BEI correctly distinguished thin and overweight patients in terms of fat mass, only BEI accurately segregated these patients by LBM (P = 0.007). Serial weights of 39 CAPD patients followed longitudinally for three or more months did not correlate with BEI-measured changes in LBM. LBM was lost in 49% of patients as determined by BEI, while serial weights detected a loss of LBM in 36% of these patients. Strikingly, by serial weights, 64% of patients demonstrated weight gain; however, in 24% of these an actual loss of LBM was demonstrated by BEI. BEI provides specific quantitation of LBM in CAPD patients with changing body habitus and unrecognized nutritional derangement.","1223":"The use of amino acid (AA) dialysate in CAPD patients may have theoretical disadvantages, since protein ingestion is known to suppress food intake in humans disproportionately to its energy value. Therefore we measured subjective appetite and food intake of CAPD patients in a cross-over study of 16 subjects (age 22-75 years, BMI 19-31, &gt; 3 months on CAPD, non-diabetic and not protein malnourished). They received, in random order, either 4 weeks of dextrose only (their usual treatment), or one AA (1%) exchange replacing the first dextrose exchange each day. Subjective measurements of food intake (3 day food record) and quantitative measurements of lunch time food intake were obtained during a morning dextrose exchange after 28 days of each regimen. Except for a reduction in feelings of fullness during the AA treatment, there were no effects on feelings of hunger\/satiety, food appeal, lunch-time food intake, or on 3-day food intake. We conclude that the use of a daily AA (1%) dialysate for 4 weeks does not affect subjective appetite or food intake of CAPD patients. There may even be a beneficial effect as the feeling of fullness decreased with the AA treatment.","1224":"Ultra high frequency (UHF, 10-20 kHz) and conventional audiometric thresholds (0,25-8 kHz) were obtained from 42 stable CAPD patients. Twenty-one (50%) and 11 (25%) of the patients had UHF and conventional hearing loss respectively, when compared to age related control data. This was unrelated to length of chronic renal failure and number of treatments with ototoxic drugs. Sixteen of these patients were monitored audiometrically using UHF during a course of vancomycin therapy for peritonitis. There was no significant change in hearing thresholds. In conclusion there is high incidence of hearing loss in CAPD patients which is unrelated to ototoxic drugs.","1225":"Hypocalcemia can be a significant problem for the patient with end stage renal disease (ESRD). Although oral calcium supplementation and activated vitamin D therapy may be successful in normalizing serum calcium levels, occasional peritoneal dialysis patients have persistent and clinically significant hypocalcemia. Several researchers have successfully utilized intraperitoneal calcium therapy (ICT) for the treatment of this abnormality. In order to evaluate whether high calcium dialysate is well tolerated, we developed a model system of ICT in Sprague Dawley rats. These rats received intraperitoneal infusion with either normal or high calcium peritoneal dialysate. Studies in this experimental rodent model showed no evidence of adverse effects of high calcium dialysate when used for up to 71 days, except for unexplained weight loss in the high calcium group. ICT can be an important adjunct in the treatment of hypocalcemia seen in patients on peritoneal dialysis. This preliminary animal study supports its clinical use. However further long term studies in animal models will be necessary to establish the long term safety of this therapy.","1226":"A known complication of long-term hemodialysis, acquired cystic kidney disease (ACKD) has been reported infrequently in association with chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The duration of end stage renal failure (ESRF) is thought to correlate with the development of ACKD. Renal cell carcinoma has been reported in 4-10% of patients with ACKD. Two patients on CAPD for more than 6 years without prior hemodialysis treatment developed renal malignancy in the setting of ACKD. Flank and abdominal pain was the presenting symptom in both patients neither of whom had hematuria. Renal ultrasound detected cystic lesions consistent with ACKD; malignant masses were ultimately identified by CT scan. Both patients underwent flank radical nephrectomy, resumed CAPD early in the postoperative period and continue on CAPD 9 and 4 months after surgery. One patient has since developed hepatic metastasis. ACKD is an important risk factor for the development of renal cell carcinoma not only in maintenance hemodialysis patients but also in the CAPD population. A high index of suspicion and serial ultrasound screening for ACKD is warranted in patients with long-term dialysis-dependence.","1227":"Peritoneal dialysis is rarely indicated for conditions other than end-stage renal failure. Patients with refractory congestive cardiac failure, who are awaiting cardiac transplantation or have potentially reversible cardiac disease, appear to benefit from CAPD. The prognosis of patients with fulminant hepatic failure or severe acute pancreatitis has not yet been shown to improve with the addition of peritoneal dialysis to standard supportive treatment. Isolated reports have suggested that patients with hypothermia, hyperthermia, dialysis-associated ascites and drug poisonings may be treated successfully with peritoneal dialysis. The above indications are encountered infrequently and renal failure remains the only major indication for commencing patients on peritoneal dialysis.","1228":"We studied 1,622 patients who started regular dialysis treatment between 1985 and 1989 in 19 centers from the Italian CAPD Study Group. There were 962 pts (59%) and on HD; 660 pts (41%) on CAPD. CAPD pts were older and had more risk factors at the start than HD pts (p &lt; 0.0001). Overall patient survival was not statistically different between CAPD and HD at 6 years (42% CAPD; 54% HD). Multivariate analysis (Cox's model) on all population revealed that age and pretreatment risk factors had a statistically significant impact on patient survival (p &lt; 0.0001), but not the type of dialytic treatment (CAPD or HD). When multivariate analysis was applied separately by treatment modalities, in HD group age and risk factors had the same negative influence on survival (p &lt; 0.0001) while in CAPD group the influence of age on survival was less significant (p 0.025). This multicenter study carried out with appropriate statistical methods in a large number of pts demonstrates that patients' survival at 6 years is not different on CAPD and HD (despite the worse patient selection on CAPD) and can be even better on CAPD for aged patients.","1229":"Peritoneal dialysis is the preferred form of dialysis during pregnancy because it is continuous and lacks the wide variation in chemistries, weight and blood pressure, and avoids the use of anticoagulation necessary during hemodialysis. This is a case report of a successful vaginal delivery of a 35 week healthy baby boy to a patient with end stage renal disease receiving peritoneal dialysis. Approximately one year after starting peritoneal dialysis for end stage renal disease of unknown etiology, this patient was noted to be pregnant during a transplant evaluation. BUN and creatinine generation increased with pregnancy. In order to keep the plasma BUN less than 50 mg\/dl and creatinine less than 5 mg\/dl, BUN and creatinine removal were increased by increasing the liters of dialysate from 8 liters to 16 liters per day. The peritoneal volume decreased from an initial 2 liters to 0.8 liter per exchange. The frequency of exchange increased. This was accomplished at home with a cycler so the patient was able to continue self care and maintain a quality of life. Peritoneal equilibration test during pregnancy did not change.","1230":"This study was conducted to assess quantitative and qualitative changes in serum albumin in CAPD patients. For twenty-six CAPD patients as well as age-, sex- and dialysis history-matched HD patients, biochemical and physiological parameters including urea kinetics were determined. Albumin was qualitatively evaluated by HPLC. The CAPD patients showed significant decreases in serum albumin and the reduced form of albumin accompanied by a lower protein catabolic rate(PCR) compared to the HD patients. Thirty five % of CAPD patients showed mild to moderate hypoalbuminemia, associated with a higher incidence of peritonitis and longer hospital stay. Patients with hypoalbuminemia had less of the reduced form of albumin. A weak positive correlation was found between serum albumin concentration and KT\/V, and PCR. Thus, in CAPD patients, there occur quantitative and qualitative changes in serum albumin. Hypoalbuminemia may be a risk factor for peritonitis and is due in part to insufficient dialysis and protein intake. Intermolecular change in albumin may possibly be due to uremia per se.","1231":"We compared 10 patients treated with overnight APD in their homes with a parallel group of 30 patients having CAPD (Freeline II) over two years 1990 and 1991. Our aim was to discover if APD was an efficient and cost effective alternative to CAPD. The average amount of dialysate used per day in APD patients was 11 litres (range 9 to 14 litres) compared to 6.8 litres (range 6 to 10 litres) for CAPD. The average plasma creatinine was 920 umol\/L, plasma urea of 21 mmol\/L on APD and 825 umol\/L and 24 mmol\/L respectively on CAPD. In 1990 there were 2 incidences of peritonitis (2 in 1991) in the APD patients compared to 24 incidences (24 in 1991) in the CAPD patients with 6 recurrences (5 in 1991) and 19 exist site infections (24 in 1991). The average fluid costs plus disposables were comparable. However the cost of treating complications per patient for APD was for 1990 32 pounds (108 pounds in 1991) and for CAPD 832 pounds (1308 pounds in 1991). All the APD patients who had previously experienced CAPD preferred this treatment for its convenience and social acceptability. APD is a cost-effective alternative to CAPD and has advantages in some patients.","1232":"This paper reviews the qualitative and quantitative approaches to assessing the adequacy of peritoneal dialysis. The quantitative measures reviewed include the KT\/V urea index, the dialysis index, the weekly creatinine clearance, and the creatinine efficiency number. Studies that support as well as refute these measures are reviewed briefly. Many of these studies are retrospective analyses of longitudinal data in small numbers of patients or prospective cross-sectional studies. A prospective, longitudinal study involving large numbers of patients is required to resolve some of the controversies regarding the adequacy of peritoneal dialysis.","1233":"Pseudotumor of the craniocervical junction and destructive spondyloarthropathy (DSA) are the most serious forms of dialysis amyloidosis (DAA). Pain and paralysis due to these lesions significantly impair activity of a patients' daily life (ADL). CAPD improved ADL of a 54 year-old male patient complicated with various forms of DAA after 17 years of hemodialysis (HD) treatment. He was first diagnosed as having carpal tunnel syndrome 12 years after initiation of hemodialysis followed by dialysis shoulders(12 years), trigger fingers(12 years), bone cysts(15 years), tendon ruptures(17 years), DSA and a pseudotumor of the craniocervical junction(17 years). Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) taken in May 1989 revealed a pseudotumor of the craniocervical junction, which was 30 mm in diameter, located in front of partially destroyed C1 and C2. Neck pain and muscle weakness rendered him bed ridden. Six months after switching to CAPD with administration of prednisolone, neck pain disappeared. He recovered the muscle power by physical rehabilitation. At last it became possible for him to perform the CAPD procedure by himself and drive a car to the hospital as an out patient. In such cases of pseudotumors of the craniocervical junction, CAPD is one of the best methods for relieving the pain and muscle weakness.","1234":"We retrospectively reviewed 167 consecutive peritoneal dialysis patients with regard to serum albumin (Alb), mortality and abdominal complications. In addition, 25 patients were studied with serial measurements of urea kinetics. The patients were divided into four groups based on their dialysis index (DI) and normalized protein catabolic rate (NPCR) (Table I). 12\/167 patients were identified with abdominal catastrophes. Before these complications occurred, the M Alb in this group was 2.67 + 0.24 (compared to age, sex and disease matched controls of 3.55 + .11 P &lt; .05). Six of these patients died from abdominal complications. In the 26 patients with serial urea kinetic studies, 4\/11 patients in group IV died (low NPCR and low DI) (P &lt; .05 compared to Group I, II or III). We conclude that urea kinetic modeling is predictive of outcome in those patients with presumed poor nutrition and inadequate dialysis and that abdominal catastrophes are more common in those patients with poor nutrition. Prospective interventional studies should be designed in an attempt to improve the poor outcome in this group of patients.","1235":"We studied the effect of chronic intraperitoneal (ip) infusion of saline supplemented with the glycosaminoglycan-chondroitin sulphate 0.1% on the permeability and peroxidation of the peritoneal membrane in rats and compared this with the effect of saline infusion alone. Animals treated with chondroitin sulphate had a higher net ultrafiltration (uf), a slower glucose absorption from the dialysate and less trans-peritoneal loss of proteins. Chronic ip infusion of chondroitin sulphate reduced peroxidation of the peritoneum. These observations suggest that chondroitin may effect the peritoneal interstitium-an important barrier of fluid and solutes transport.","1236":"A simple, non-invasive and well-tolerated technique for routine measurement of intraperitoneal hydrostatic pressure (IPP) in patients treated with peritoneal dialysis (PD) is presented. The height of the dialysis fluid in the PD line was measured, under atmospheric pressure, before drainage and during inspiration (IPPinsp) and expiration (IPPexp), taking the axillary line as the reference point of the resting subject in strict supine position. Normal values were established for a population of 18 patients treated with PD for 19.8 +\/- 20.9 months under clinical and biological stable conditions. For an intraperitoneal volume of 2,820 +\/- 419 ml, IPPinsp = 14 +\/- 2 cmH2O; IPPexp = 12 +\/- 2 cmH2O; IPP mean (defined as (IPPinsp+IPPexp)\/2) = 13 +\/- 2 cmH2O; IPP (defined as IPPinsp - IPPexp) = 2 +\/- 2 cmH2O. IPP could not predict mechanical complications (hernia, hemorrhoids, dialysis fluid leakage) but the maximal IPPexp clinically tolerated was 20 cmH2O.","1237":"A large end stage renal failure population treated by chronic ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was examined for rates of infection, CAPD modality failure and patient survival (N = 347). Nearly half were considered high risk for survival for reasons of age (39% older than 60 years), diabetes mellitus (33%), hemodialysis access failure (10%), poor cardiopulmonary reserve (16%) or technical challenges (30% had morbid obesity, history of abdominal aortic aneurysm repair or multiple abdominal surgeries). Hence, CAPD was often initiated by default rather than choice in the 347 patients studied (mean age: 51 +\/- 17 years). Infections greatly outnumbered technical failures as grounds for cessation of CAPD. Over 5521 patient-months, 51% of patients developed infection with peritonitis predominating (80%) when compared to exit site infections (20%). The frequency of infections was 1.9 mean episodes per patient; however, 55% of these patients had only one episode of peritonitis. A rate of 0.75 infections per patient per year was seen with an average interval of 16 months between infections. Technique and patient survival rates at 4 years were 50% and 61% respectively. High risk status does not preclude successful CAPD and should not preclude its implementation.","1238":"CAPD patients require supplemental iron to maintain a response to erythropoietin. Because of limited availability of parenteral iron dextran, oral iron must be used. However, oral iron may not be effective in most dialysis patients. To determine if oral iron is well absorbed, a modified oral iron absorption or tolerance test was performed in CAPD patients using two oral iron preparations. Serum irons were measured at baseline in a fasting state and repeated two hours after the ingestion of 325 mgs ferrous sulfate in five CAPD patients. In addition, eight patients had serum irons determined before and two hours after taking liquid oral ferrous fumarate in capsule form. Healthy controls were compared with each group. All five patients who received ferrous sulfate had borderline to low normal serum iron and iron stores. Average increase in serum irons was only 19 mcg\/dl in patients compared to 52 mcg\/dl in controls. Patients receiving ferrous fumarate rose only 14 mcg\/dl compared to 60 mcg\/dl in controls. We conclude that oral iron is poorly absorbed in most CAPD patients and that the oral iron absorption test may be helpful in identifying patients who are effective iron absorbers. Unfortunately, until parenteral iron dextran is readily available, oral iron therapy is the only alternative for iron supplement. The oral iron absorption test may predict who will respond to oral iron in the long-term.","1239":"","1240":"Accurate residual volume (RV) measurements are needed in studies on fluid kinetics during CAPD. In this study 10 stable CAPD patients were examined twice within 1 week. On both occasions RV after drainage was calculated by the indicator dilution method. Exogenous (dextran 70, inulin) and endogenous (albumin, IgG, urea, creatinine) solutes were used as markers. RV calculated with endogenous solutes (mean +\/- SD) were significantly higher than those calculated with dextran (232 +\/- 77 mL) and inulin (223 +\/- 73): albumin (389 +\/- 123), IgG (497 +\/- 180), urea (465 +\/- 129) and creatinine (429 +\/- 109). The relationship between RV calculated with exogenous solutes was much better than between those calculated with endogenous solutes: dextran vs inulin (r = 0.91), albumin vs IgG (r = 0.69) and urea vs creatinine (r = 0.63). Since mass transport of endogenous solutes during rinsing time exceeds mass transport of dextran and inulin, RV was also calculated after corrections had been made for diffusive mass transport of endogenous solutes during the rinsing procedure. After this correction only albumin was similar to exogenous solutes (244 +\/- 111 mL) and had an acceptable confidence interval when compared to dextran. No correlation was found between RV on the first and second day, suggesting large intra-individual variability. We conclude that RV should be calculated with dextran or inulin. When no exogenous solutes are used, albumin is the best alternative. However, only rough estimations are obtained when no correction for diffusion is applied.","1241":"Peritoneal lymphatic absorption rate (LAR) in 15 patients on a CAPD program was measured by estimation of the disappearance of dextran 70 from the peritoneal cavity. The LAR was 1.03 +\/- 0.45 ml\/min. The cumulative lymphatic absorption, cumulative net transcapillary ultrafiltration, calculated net ultrafiltration (CUF) and measured net ultrafiltration (MUF) at 4 h exchange were respectively: 261 +\/- 127 ml, 694 +\/- 134 ml, 446 +\/- 135 ml and 409 +\/- 136 ml. Calculated and measured net ultrafiltration didn't differ significantly. An inverse correlation between MUF and LAR and a positive correlation between MUF and the ratio for dialysate glucose concentration at 4 hand dialysate glucose at 0 h (G4\/G0) were observed (r = -0.522 and 0.547, respectively, p &lt; 0.05). The multiple correlation coefficient between the MUF and LAR plus G4\/G0 was higher (r = 0.617, p &lt; 0.05). Peritonitis and the presence of diabetes didn't interfere with LAR. We have concluded that lymphatic absorption plus peritoneal transfer rate of glucose are important determinants of intraperitoneal volumes and that dextran 70 is a useful marker to measure lymphatic absorption.","1242":"Adequacy of CAPD has not been established. The recommendation is a Kt\/V (K, total urea clearance in ml\/min; t. time in minutes on dialysis; and V, total body water which is the volume of distribution of urea) greater than 1.5\/week and\/or a creatinine clearance (residual + dialysis) greater than 40 l\/week\/1.73 m2. We followed 20 CAPD patients for 38.6 +\/- 28 mo. We measured blood urea nitrogen, serum creatinine, body weight, residual renal function (Kr), normalized protein catabolic rate (NPCR), Kt\/V\/week and creatinine clearance (CC) l\/w\/1.73 m2. We obtained the following values: B Wt 72 +\/- 16 kg, BUN 56 +\/- 13 mg\/dl, s. Cr. 12.6 +\/- 5 mg\/dl, Kr 0.6 +\/- 1 ml\/min, NPCR 0.84 +\/- 0.3 g\/kg\/day, Kt\/V\/week 1.8 +\/- 0.3 and CC 50.4 +\/- 10 l\/w\/1.73 m2. Patients dialyzed with a wide range of prescription. There was a good correlation between Kt\/V and CC. There was no correlation between the dialysis prescription changes in weight and biochemical determinations. There was a direct correlation between Kt\/V and NPCR: patients who were dialyzed more eat more. Of the 20 patients, 10 had 24 hospitalizations, and of these were 12 due to peritonitis. Dialysis prescription and biochemical findings of these patients did not differ significantly from nonhospitalized patients. Larger prospective studies are necessary to determine the adequate range of CAPD prescription and its relationship to morbidity and mortality.","1243":"The transport of macromolecules such as proteins and dextrans during CAPD is restricted by the permeability of the peritoneum. When its degree is determined by diffusion characteristics of macromolecules, the intrinsic permeability of the peritoneal membrane can be expressed as the relation between clearance of macromolecules and parameters of diffusion velocity. In order to characterize the peritoneal restriction barrier in individual patients, such a relationship has to meet the following conditions: (a) a good fit to linearity, (b) a low inter- and intra individual variability and (c) similarity for proteins and equal sized dextran fractions. In the present study a comparison is made between the reciprocal plot (RP): C-1 = s (esr) + A and the diffusion plot (DP): C = A'. Ds20,w. In these equations C is clearance, esr is Einstein Stokes radius, D20,w is the free diffusion coefficient in water, A and A' are constants, while s is the slope of the regression line and therefore represents intrinsic peritoneal permeability to macromolecules. The 95% confidence interval of the correlation coefficient r was above 0.95 in all studies for the RP and the DP. In general it was somewhat higher for the DP. The inter-individual coefficient of variation was lower in the DP than in the RP. This was also the case for the intra-individual coefficient of variation of the slope for proteins (DP 4% vs RP 27%, p less than 0.01) and for dextrans (DP 18% vs RP 47%, p less than 0.05). The correlation coefficient between dextran slopes and protein slopes was higher for DP (r = 0.68) than for RP (r = 0.50).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1244":"The use of intraperitoneally administered dextran 70 was investigated for measurement of lymphatic absorption in CAPD patients. For this purpose a fast, highly accurate HPLC method was developed, that was not influenced by the high glucose concentration in peritoneal dialysate, nor by the inulin that was added to the dialysate for the measurement of residual volume. Pretreatment of the samples consisted of deproteinization with trichloroacetic acid, followed by incubation at 45 degrees C to hydrolyze inulin. This was followed by a further rinsing step using a Sephadex G-25 PD-10 column. The HPLC was performed on a Bio-Gel XL guard column with refractive index detection. Because of the short guard column the chromatographic analysis was only 5 minutes for one sample. With the method described lymphatic absorption rate was measured in 30 CAPD patients and was found to range from 0.1 to 3.5 mL\/min, median 1.0 mL\/min.","1245":"During the last six years 13 patients suffering from congestive heart failure (CHF), refractory to conventional medical treatment and classified class IV as defined by the New York Heart Association (NYHA), were treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) (1) at Innsbruck University Hospital, Department of Internal Medicine. All patients required intensive care and were end-stage. The minimum observation period was six weeks, maximum 67 months. Cardiac recompensation was effected in all patients, who were stabilized in class II after NYHA. The patient with the shortest observation period of six weeks received an orthotopic heart transplant. None of the patients died of a CAPD-associated complication. All patients were restored to a normal life style without major dependence on outside help. The occurrence and treatment of the prerenal kidney failure that causes life-threatening problems in end-stage CHF should be subject to further study with regard to its clinical course and the determination of plasma-ANF, plasma-renin and plasma-aldosterone concentration.","1246":"A 27-year-old patient on CAPD presented with febrile illness and abdominal pain suggestive of peritonitis. Dialysis fluid culture yielded Enterococcus. Response to treatment was slow, with pain persisting. Laparotomy revealed a toothpick, which was causing peritoneal irritation. It was unclear how the foreign object entered the peritoneum.","1247":"The prevalence and severity of renal cystic changes in 15 continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients were compared with those in 15 hemodialysis patients matched by age, sex and duration of dialysis. Cyst grade and kidney volume were prospectively evaluated using CT scan. In 15 age- and sex-matched patients on long-term dialysis, follow-up for a mean of 32 months, beginning 73 months after the start of dialysis, revealed that, in both treatment modalities, a significant increase in cyst grade, kidney volume and the rate of increase in kidney volume as a reflection of cystic change (3.08 +\/- 3.87 [mean +\/- SD] ml\/month in CAPD, 1.43 +\/- 1.17 ml\/month in hemodialysis) had occurred. However, differences in these parameters between CAPD and hemodialysis groups were not significant. In 7 patients in the CAPD group who were also treated by hemodialysis, it could not be statistically proven that the rate of increase in kidney volume during initial hemodialysis was different from that observed in subsequent CAPD (2.60 +\/- 2.44 ml\/month during hemodialysis, 5.13 +\/- 4.94 ml\/month during CAPD). This longitudinal prospective study suggests that the prevalence and severity of acquired renal cystic disease are the same in long-term CAPD and hemodialysis patients.","1248":"An 80-year-old female developed massive right hydrothorax at the start of an IPD program. Peritoneal dialysis was interrupted and after complete evacuation of the pleural effusion, 40 ml of the patient's blood was infused into the right pleural cavity. For the first 2 days the patient maintained the Fowler position. Three weeks later, IPD was recommended, but pleural effusion reappeared early on. Infusion of a further 40 ml of the patient's blood was repeated after another pleural evacuation and the dialysis was again stopped for another 3-week period. Subsequently, IPD was restarted with only one-liter exchanges and the patient kept in the Fowler position during the dialysis sessions. After three weeks, standard IPD was started with the patient supine and two-liter exchanges. Hydrothorax did not re-appear and so far (12-month follow-up) no pleural effusion has been noticed. The patient feels well on IPD. Blood instillation was painless and caused one-day fever on the first time only. Pleurodesis achieved with autologous blood is a very safe, simple and effective way of treating hydrothorax in PD patients.","1249":"Intraperitoneal and subcutaneous routes of administration for diabetics on CAPD were compared. The comparison included: (1) Control of blood glucose concentration: both methods can provide satisfactory glycemic control for most patients. Changing the method of insulin administration is warranted when one method fails. (2) Effect on plasma insulin levels: intraperitoneal administration can produce a plasma insulin profile similar to the normal profile. This is unusual with subcutaneous administration. Consequences of hyperinsulinemia (hyperlipidemia, hypertension) seem, however, to be similar between the two methods of insulin administration. (3) Effect on peritoneal permeability: permeability characteristics are maintained unchanged, usually, with either method after long-term CAPD. However, insulin is mitogenic in vitro. Theoretically, intraperitoneal insulin could lead to peritoneal fibrosis. (4) Effect on infectious complications of CAPD: a difference in the rate of peritonitis or overall PD catheter-related infections has not been convincingly demonstrated between the two methods of insulin administration. Exit site and tunnel infections with staphylococcus aureus may be more frequent in diabetics receiving insulin subcutaneously. (5) Effect on hepatic structure and function: subcapsular hepatic steatosis was described in diabetics receiving insulin intraperitoneally. The clinical significance of this finding remains to be demonstrated. We conclude that both methods can be applied for insulin administration in diabetics on CAPD. The intraperitoneal method should be tried first in most instances. Prospective studies comparing the two methods are needed.","1250":"Polycythemia in CAPD patients has been rarely described. Over an eight year period, 4 out of 123 CAPD patients (3%) were identified as having Hct values exceeding 50% for 1 month or longer. All of the 4 patients were insulin dependent diabetics (4\/47 diabetic patients, 8.5%). Charts were reviewed on 3 of these 4 patients. Polycythemia developed after a mean of 21 +\/- 7 months on peritoneal dialysis. Prior to the development of polycythemia, ferritin levels were low and ferrous sulfate therapy was begun at a time the Hct values were 36 to 40%. Erythropoietin levels were obtained in 2 patients, and were 22 U\/L (Hct 51%) and less than 5 U\/L (Hct 55%). Renal ultrasound failed to show renal masses or cysts. One patient had a plasma volume of 2.1 L (normal 2.4-3.2 L); another patient was clinically volume depleted. Complications during the period of polycythemia included gangrenous feet requiring amputation in 2 patients, CVA in 2 patients, and splenic infarct in 1 patient. One patient died of cerebral thrombosis. We conclude that polycythemia is uncommon in CAPD patients and occurs most often in diabetic patients. Volume depletion and iron therapy may play a role in its etiology. In this high risk group of patients polycythemia may contribute to vascular complications and should be avoided.","1251":"This report shows our experience with 13 patients aged 70-83 years who started CAPD treatment 1981-1989. There were 7 females and 6 males. The total treatment time was 298 months (range 4-104). Nine of the patients were able to perform all CAPD procedures while 4 patients needed some help. The patients who were able to take care of all procedures had the lowest period of terminal care, i.e. the period preceding death when the patients had to be taken care of by the hospital staff. The terminal care period was 5.1% of the total treatment period. In the patients who needed help from the beginning of the treatment, the terminal care was 17.2% of the total treatment period. The frequency of peritonitis was 1 per 10.2 treatment month. The main cause for hospitalization was peritonitis and terminal care at the end of the lives of the patients. No patients died due to peritonitis. However, two patients were transferred to hemodialysis due to recurrent peritonitis and ultrafiltration loss, one was transplanted and one was transferred to IPD due to weakness. The causes of death were myocardial infarction, cerebral stroke and cardiac insufficiency. No deaths were due to peritonitis. CAPD in patients above 70 years of age is acceptable both on the basis of the somatic situation and of quality of life.","1252":"To evaluate patient survival among geriatric patients by dialytic treatment of choice we assigned all patients aged 65 years and older treated in Michigan to either CAPD at home or center hemodialysis (HD) according to the treatment used on day 120 of ESRD therapy. Michigan Kidney Registry files on all 308 CAPD and 1244 HD patients who started ESRD therapy during 1980-1987 were used for this study. The Cox proportional hazards model revealed a significantly increased relative death rate (RR) for patients with diabetes (RR = 1.91, p less than 0.001) and hypertension (RR 1.4, p less than 0.01) as cause of ESRD when adjusting for age, sex, race, treatment and year of incidence. White patients had a 51% higher relative death rate overall when compared to black patients (p less than 0.001) and specifically among hypertensive (RR = 1.65, p less than 0.001) and diabetic patients (RR = 1.59, p less than 0.001). Those differences were still significant when taking higher rates of withdrawal from dialysis among white patients into account. The relative death rates for CAPD patients was essentially the same as for HD patients overall, however, diabetic CAPD patients appeared to have a higher than diabetic HD patients (RR = 1.58, p = 0.1). This statistically not significant difference may be related to selection of patients with cardiovascular risk into CAPD. There was no trend in mortality over time. By modality on day 120, CAPD has similar outcomes as HD in geriatric non diabetic patients.","1253":"Clinical complications and outcome of 50 patients, age 65 or older, on dialysis during 1985-1990 were studied. There were three groups: Peritoneal Dialysis (PD-10 pts.), Hemodialysis (HD-28 pts.), and both for at least one month each (PD-HD 12 pts.) (8 HD to PD and 4 PD to HD). Analysis included sex, age, bacteremia associated to acute vascular accesses (AVA), peritonitis (PD), other illnesses, hospital days, blood chemistries, quality of life (active, sedentary or bedridden). The most frequent causes of death were septicemia and cardiac failure. No difference was found in age, chemistries, hemoglobin, illnesses or quality of life. The results showed a significant improved overall survival for those in the PD group (77.8%, p less than 0.05) as compared to HD or PD-HD group. Therefore, more emphasis should be placed on using PD for elderly patients.","1254":"Apparent loss of peritoneal ultrafiltration capacity may occur when fluid intake is excessive, residual urine volumes decrease or the patient does not perform exchanges regularly and should be suspected if drain volumes are unchanged. True loss of ultrafiltration capacity (reduced drain volumes) is potentially reversible if due to catheter malposition, internal dialysate leakage or recent peritonitis but is usually permanent if kinetic studies indicate a sustained reduction in net transcapillary ultrafiltration or increased lymphatic drainage. Three types of irreversible ultrafiltration failure have been identified of which high peritoneal solute transport rates resulting in rapid dialysate glucose absorption (Type 1 membrane failure) is the most common. Transcapillary ultrafiltration may also be reduced due to very low peritoneal solute transport rates (Type 2 membrane failure) in patients with sclerosing peritonitis or massive peritoneal adhesions but is now rare. Ultrafiltration failure due to high lymphatic drainage (Type 3 failure) is also uncommon. Treatment strategies in patients with Type 1 failure include achieving the maximum urine output with diuretics, reducing fluid intake to the minimum tolerated by the patient, changing to short dwell exchanges (daytime ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (DAPD) or machine peritoneal dialysis overnight) and temporary hemodialysis which may lead to a spontaneous reduction in peritoneal transport rates in some patients. Patients with Type 2 and Type 3 failure require permanent transfer to hemodialysis.","1255":"The purpose of this study was to determine which factors are most important in choosing between ESRD treatments and to assess if patients, R.N.'s and M.D.'s agree or differ as to the level of importance of different factors. 22 patients, 11 R.N.'s and 10 M.D.'s were interviewed to determine which factors should be considered. Forty-three factors were identified relevant to CAPD and hemodialysis. Then 14 patients, 8 R.N.'s and M.D.'s were asked to rate each of these factors on a scale of 1-10 (10 being most important) and the average score for each was computed. The factors were then ranked in order of importance (1 being most important). The results revealed that peritonitis ranked as overall the most important factor in determining treatment modality choice. In general, life style considerations ranked higher than medical consequences of a specific therapy. There was concordance amongst the three groups in some areas but there were also differences between patients, R.N.'s and M.D.'s. This raises important issues with regards to the adequacy of patient counselling. ","1256":"Experience with chronic intermittent peritoneal dialysis is reviewed to focus on automated peritoneal dialysis (APD) regimens, adequacy and indications. From 1969 to 1990, 74 ESRD patients were treated: 59 patients with Intermittent Peritoneal Dialysis (IPD: 30-40 l x 3\/week) and fifteen patients with hour Daily Peritoneal Dialysis (DPD: 25 l x 6 nights\/week). Fourty-four patients were regularly treated with IPD. Of these 33 were adequately dialysed, maintaining residual renal function, whilst oligo-anuric patients developed underdialysis. DPD patients were adequately dialysed, having satisfactory peritoneal clearances. Peritonitis rate was 1\/19.2 pt months in IPD patients and 1\/13.4 pt months in DPD patients. Technique survival was 78% at the end of the first year, and 52% the second year. IPD is adequate only for low body weight patients with residual renal function. In-hospital IPD must be taken into account only for patients unable to perform dialysis without partner assistance. Home DPD, like CCPD and NPD, is generally adequate and yields fairly good quality of life, but the cost is high, probably because of limited ADP diffusion. Prescription must be therefore restricted to patients unable to perform dialysis with working partners, workers who cannot cope with CAPD exchanges, and CAPD failures.","1257":"Many patients with failed renal transplants elect to receive continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) as their modality of dialysis. For others, cardiovascular considerations or access difficulties make CAPD a necessary option when these patients return to dialysis. It is unclear what effects renal transplantation, chronic immunosuppressive therapy and graft rejection might have on the integrity of the peritoneal membrane. We report on thirteen patients receiving CAPD who had peritoneal equilibration test (PET) studies after a failed renal transplant. Three of these patients had studies done pre and post transplantation. Our solute equilibration studies demonstrated that for 10 patients studied with the older 4.25% technique the mean post transplantation D\/P creatinine was 0.688 (SE:0.039) on the border of high and low average, and the mean D\/Do glucose was 0.228 (SE:0.024) in the high transporter range. Three patients tested pre and post transplantation (upon their return to CAPD after graft failure) had no change in these values. From the above data, 13 patients with peritoneal equilibration testing post transplantation have well-functioning peritoneal membranes allowing for adequate dialysis and flexibility in dialysis prescription. We conclude that renal transplantation does not adversely affect peritoneal membrane function if these patients return to CAPD after graft failure.","1258":"Peritoneal clearances of urea (C(urea)) and creatinine (Ccr), peritoneal protein losses (PL) and ultrafiltration (UF) were retrospectively evaluated in 12 diabetic patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) during a four year study. The average of three determinations each year was calculated. There were not significant differences in C(urea) (ml\/24 hours), Ccr (ml\/24 hours), PL (g\/24 hours) and UF (ml\/24 hours) between the four years and basal values or in the year to year studies. Seven patients did not modify their CAPD schedule during the four years study and we did not find any statistical differences in this group in the parameters studied. There was an average incidence of peritonitis of 4.7 episodes, higher in the 2 first years (p less than 0.05). The peritonitis incidence did not affect any of the functional parameters evaluated. The results of our study suggest that C(urea), Ccr, PL and UF in diabetic patients are not affected by long-term CAPD or by the peritonitis incidence.","1259":"Carbohydrates present on the surface of cells have been implicated in such processes as bacterial adherence, surfactant secretion and reutilization, and cell-cell recognition. In this study, fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) conjugated lectins were used to probe for such carbohydrates on the surface and interior regions of rabbit peritoneal mesothelial cells propagated in vitro. A cell permeabilization technique employing treatment with formalin and saponin provided the greatest presentation of surface membrane structure and lectin binding. FITC-lectins derived from C. ensiformis (Concanavalin A; mannose specific), T. vulgaris, A. hypogaea, E. cristagalli, B. simplicifolia, and M. pomifera bound to the cell surface. When two strains of Edwarsiella tarda were exposed to the mesothelial cells, only the mannose-specific strain (ET-4) demonstrated substantial adherence to the cell surface.","1260":"The peritoneal barrier exchange characteristics are in this article described in terms of a three-pore model of membrane permselectivity. The peritoneal membrane during continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) is thus simulated to have a large number of small pores of radius 40-55 A, a small number of large pores of radius 200-300 A, and an abundance of transcellular pores of radius 4-5 A. Due to the heteroporous nature of the peritoneal membrane, peritoneal small solute sieving coefficients are of the order of 0.5-0.6, and not near unity, as predicted for a homoporous membrane having 50 A (radius) equivalent pores, but lacking transcellular pores. As a consequence, the dialysate during CAPD is diluted during the first 50-100 minutes of the dwell. Furthermore, there is a marked coupling between the increased net transperitoneal volume flow, occurring early in the cycle, and the transfer of \"small\" macromolecules, such as beta 2-microglobulin and albumin, across the peritoneal membrane. This coupling is, however, small for \"large\" macromolecules, such as IgG and IgM, or for small solutes. Increasing the peritoneal surface area, in computer simulations of peritoneal transport according to the three-pore model, causes the simulated intraperitoneal (i.p.) volume vs. time (V(t)) curves to peak earlier than during control, while the maximum volume ultrafiltered is not markedly affected. However, selectively increasing the glucose PS (mass transfer area coefficient) causes a reduction both in the peak time and the peak \"height\" of the V(t) curves. The latter pattern is also seen when the dialysate volume is reduced. It is concluded that a three-pore model of membrane permselectivity selectivity can adequately describe the kinetics of peritoneal transport of small and large solutes and of fluid.","1261":"Anemia of CRF has been corrected by use of H-R-EPO both in hemodialysis and CAPD patients. Long term response to subcutaneous EPO and its relationship with serum EPO levels remain to be established. Twenty-five CAPD patients treated with CAPD during 30 +\/- 28 (mean +\/- SD) months were included in this study. The follow-up period was 6-24 months. All patients have been on CAPD at least 6 months and their Hemoglobin (Hb) level was lower than 8.5 g\/dl. Twelve patients received EPO by subcutaneous route, at doses of 20 u.\/Kg daily and 13 other patients at doses of 2000 units twice a week. Thereafter, these doses were adjusted to obtain a Hemoglobin level ranging 10.5-13 g\/dl. In conclusion, our results suggest that the subcutaneous route for H-R-Erythropoietin can be considered as the best choice for CAPD patients. Low doses twice a week seem to improve anemia in 2 months. Later, dose adjustment should be done according to the patient's response. The improvement in nutritional status we observed suggests a new positive aspect for EPO therapy. Our data did not show changes in peritoneal function.","1262":"Experience in the use of subcutaneous erythropoietin in 18 CAPD patients is presented. The total and mean (SD) durations on CAPD were 419 and 23.3 (20.5) months, respectively. Eleven patients started treatment with normal or elevated iron stores, 7 had an initial iron saturation less than 20%. The initial hematocrit was 22.0 (3.1%). Eleven patients reached a steady state hematocrit (34.1 +\/- 3.5%) by the end of the study period, and the mean percentage increase in hematocrit for all 18 patients was 47% over the initial hematocrit. All patients responded to EPO. The initial dose of EPO was 157.6 U\/kg\/wk, and all patients received oral iron supplements. There was no significant change in the means of any iron parameters. Transfusion requirements decreased from a mean of 0.42 transfusions per month per patient during the 12 months, prior to EPO, to 0.22 during the study. There were no significant changes in blood pressure or other measured parameters. Transient pain at the site of injection was noted infrequently.","1263":"The efficacy of once weekly subcutaneous erythropoietin (SC EPO) was evaluated by reviewing records of twelve continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients age 27-66 years after achieving a goal hematocrit (hct) greater than 30%. Patients had a mean hct of 22.8% (range: 19.1-29.5) and were placed on a thrice weekly SC EPO dose of 4000 international units (IU) (37-74 IU\/KG, [mean of 57 IU\/kg]) until a goal hct greater than 30% was achieved. This hct ranged from 30.8-37% (mean 33.2%) and was achieved in a mean of 11.5 weeks (range: 4.1-29 weeks). Patients were then maintained on the same SC EPO dose given only once weekly. 11\/12 (92%) patients have maintained a mean hct of 34% (range: 29-38.4%) on once weekly SC EPO over a mean period of 14 weeks (range: 1.4-36 weeks). The mean serum ferritin was 484; only two patients required parenteral iron dextran therapy. One patient did not reach the goal hct due to poor compliance. There was no significant increase in blood pressure or in serum potassium level. We conclude that SC EPO is effective in treating anemia in these patients and can be given once weekly to maintain a hct greater than 30%.","1264":"The use of recombinant human erythropoietin (rhuEPO) has revolutionized the treatment of renal anemia, but the dose regimens have not been established. We studied the effects of subcutaneous rhuEPO given 4,000U (1 vial) every 5-10 days in 9 patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Ten stable CAPD patients (6 females and 4 males; mean age +\/- SEM, 54.4 +\/- 5.6 years; mean baseline hemoglobin concentration 7.3 +\/- 1.2g\/dL) were commenced on s.c. rhuEPO. None of the patients had a history of gastrointestinal bleeding, aluminum overload, sepsis nor receiving androgens. Seven patients were receiving 4,000 U rhuEPO weekly, one patient each was receiving 4,000 U every 5 and 10 days (range, 66.7-89.3 U\/kg\/week). The dose was adjusted every 4 weeks according to response by altering the dose interval. The mean hemoglobin concentration increased from 7.3 +\/- 1.2 g\/dL to 10.3 +\/- 1.1 g\/dL over 8 weeks. There was no significant changes in the serum ferritin, urea, creatinine and potassium levels. One patient required an increase in antihypertensive therapy. We feel that s.c. rhuEPO 4,000 U given on an intermittent basis is effective in the treatment of anemia in CAPD patients. The administration of a single vial each time is convenient and cost sparing. The gradual rise in hematocrit avoids complications.","1265":"Twenty-eight hernias occurred in eighteen of seventy-nine pediatric patients on peritoneal dialysis (PD). There was 18 inguinal hernias (6 bilateral) in 12 patients (11 boys and 1 girl) the average age of the male patients with inguinal hernias was 5.2 years vs 9.3 years for the remaining 32 males. Four of the 11 patients were under 2 years old, where as only 3 of the remaining 32 patients were less than 2 (p less than 0.05), and 3 of the 6 patients with bilateral hernias were under 2. A high incidence of recurrent hernias was noted when only high ligation of the hernia sac was performed. We conclude that all candidates for PD should be carefully evaluated for the presence of occult hernias, hernias should be repaired promptly and electively on an inpatient basis, surgical correction of hernias should include a formal Cooper ligament repair and males under 2 should have bilateral repairs done even if they present with a single hernia.","1266":"The objective of this study was to assess whether eight hours of nightly tidal peritoneal dialysis (TPD) can provide uremia control equal that of CCPD\/CAPD. A pilot study collected data from patients who volunteered to use TPD at home. Six children, ages 5 to 16, who required regular dialysis and lived within a 175 miles of the training center volunteered to use home TPD. These subjects were trained and followed at the University of Iowa Hospitals and Clinics. Dialysate creatinine and urea nitrogen were measured during both CCPD and TPD. Clearances were measured for tidal dialysis using multiple dialysate flow rates. Dialysate urea clearance (KU - ml\/min normalized to 70 kg.) increased with dialysate flow (QD - ml\/kg\/H) [KU = 9.566 + 0.251 X (QD)], and dialysate urea nitrogen losses equaled those of CCPD. Eight hours of tidal dialysis can provide dialysis efficiency equal that of CAPD\/CCPD.","1267":"Peritoneal dialysis is the major form of renal replacement therapy for children awaiting renal transplantation. Peritonitis is the major associated morbidity. We retrospectively identified the pathogens, co-morbid factors and outcome of peritonitis in children on peritoneal dialysis from 1980-1989. Seventy-three children, mean age 12.4 years, received 1,234 patient months of chronic peritoneal dialysis. Twenty-four patients (33%) remained peritonitis free until their dialysis catheters were removed after transplantation. Forty-nine children (67%) developed 219 episodes of peritonitis. Peritoneal fluid cultures were positive in 169 episodes (77%). Of the pathogens identified, 73% were gram positive cocci, 22% gram negative rods, 3% were fungus, and 2% other organisms. The incidence of peritonitis was one episode per 5.6 months. Over a 10 year period: 1) 67% of children on peritoneal dialysis developed peritonitis; 2) gram positive cocci accounted for most episodes; 3) the incidence in children was higher than that reported for adults; 4) there were no deaths attributable to peritonitis.","1268":"Forty-three ESRD children received treatment with CAPD from November 1984 through July 1990. Mean patient age was 10 years (range 2-17 years) and total observation period (consolidated for the whole group) was 683 months. Double cuff Tenckhoff catheters were used as access. The most common complication was peritonitis with an overall rate of one episode per 5.6 patient\/months. Important correlation was found between incidence of peritonitis and socioeconomic status assessed by Graffar Index (G.I.). Patients with lowest socioeconomic status (GI of IV and V) had one episode of peritonitis per 2.9 patient\/months. Patients with GI of III had one episode per 5.2 patient\/months and patients with the best socioeconomic status (GI of I and II) had only one episode per 11.6 patient\/months. Other complications were the following: Infections: 18 exit site infection, 5 exit site granuloma and 5 tunnel abscess. Catheter malfunction: 17 obstructions, 5 migrations and 2 ruptures. Others: 3 peritoneal hemorrhages, 1 intestinal perforation, 3 eventrations, 4 inguinal hernias and 1 right pleural effusion. In this last patient, pleurodesis was unsuccessfully attempted with homologous blood. We conclude that patients with very low socioeconomic status are poor candidates for CAPD and should be considered preferably for hemodialysis.","1269":"Ultrafiltration (UF) using dialysate volumes of less than 20 ml\/kg was assessed in 12 critically ill infants and children with hypervolemia as the primary indication for dialysis. Ten of the 12 required mechanical ventilation (O2 requirements 45-100%). Seven, all infants, received at least one pressor intravenously in attempts to maintain systolic blood pressure of 60. Age was 22 +\/- 11.5 mos. (mean +\/- SE) with weight of 11.1 +\/- 4.3 kg (range 2.4-50 kg). Dialysis prescription was as follows: Volume of 10.1 +\/- 1.3 ml\/kg\/exchange; dwell time 30-45 minutes; drain time 15-20 minutes. Glucose concentration ranged from 1.5-4.25%. Drained dialysate volume expressed as a percent of volume instilled was 133.5 +\/- 3.4%. When calculated for body weight and time, UF was 3.0 +\/- 0.3 ml\/kg\/hour. UF was not significantly different in patients requiring pressors versus those not requiring blood pressure support. Although minor ventilatory changes were required, significant deterioration of blood gases did not occur during the first 3-6 hours of PD, nor did significant changes in blood pressure develop. Hyperkalemia, present in 1 patient prior to PD, resolved using this regimen. Low volume PD was a viable alternative to hemodialysis or hemofiltration for control of hypervolemia in this small group of very ill infants and children.","1270":"Glucose is absorbed from the dialysate more rapidly in younger than in older children on CAPD leading to a relatively early loss of ultrafiltration during dwell time. In order to assess peritoneal permeability and in term to prescribe optimal management of CAPD, we tested peritoneal equilibration curves (EC) for urea and glucose, especially the crossing time point of these two ECs. Baseline values were obtained from 8 patients divided in two groups by age at start of CAPD: group I (N = 4) mean age 1 year 6 months, mean body weight 8.25 +\/- 3.17 kg, group II (N = 4) mean age 12 years 6 months, mean body weight 33.5 +\/- 1.5 kg. The crossing time point is earlier in group I (49 +\/- 14 min) than in group II (101 +\/- 20 min) (p less than 0.001). Followup of each patient, during a mean time of 20 months in group I and 23 months in group II, establishes that the curves crossing time point for each patient remains stable.","1271":"Reduced renal clearance of aluminum and regular intake of aluminum containing phosphate binders render dialysis patients at increased risk of aluminum accumulation and toxicity. Provided the inflow dialysate aluminum concentration is kept low (less than 10 micrograms\/L) most CAPD patients have negative peritoneal mass transfer of aluminum in the effluent dialysate. Net removal of aluminum in the dialysate partially compensates for the loss of renal clearance of aluminum and helps prevent progressive tissue accumulation of aluminum. Rates of aluminum removal in the dialysate are too low, however, for effective treatment of patients with established aluminum accumulation or overt aluminum toxicity. Such patients usually require parenteral deferoxamine therapy to achieve increased aluminum removal rates. The optimum route, dosage and frequency of administration of deferoxamine in CAPD patients are not established. From the existing data, 2 g deferoxamine administration intraperitoneally three times per week in the overnight exchange appears to provide the maximum aluminum removal for minimum deferoxamine dosage.","1272":"The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) has been used in adult peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients to determine PD efficiency and optimal dialysis prescription. To investigate its usefulness in pediatric PD patients, we performed the PET in 10 patients divided into 2 groups: 3 patients less than 2 years of age (group 1) and 7 patients aged 5 to 17 years (group 2). The PET was performed after an overnight dwell by standard protocol with an overnight dialysate sample and 6 dialysate samples during the 4 hour test. Dialysate to plasma (D\/P) ratios were calculated for creatinine (Cr), urea, and protein. D\/PCr over time was similar in both pediatric groups compared to adults. D\/P urea over time was lower in both pediatric groups compared to published adult data. D\/P protein over time was markedly increased in both pediatric groups and was highest in the smallest patients. D\/P ratios are different in pediatric PD patients compared to adults. In order to be used to assess dialysis efficiency, normal values for the PET test in children need to be established.","1273":"We have studied fructosamine (measured by colorimetric methods) and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) using a high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) in 20 uremic patients managed conservatively (8 diabetics and 12 non-diabetics) and 20 patients treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) including 12 diabetics and 8 non-diabetics. Twenty healthy subjects were used as control group. We have correlated the mean blood glucose (MBG) of the preceding days to fructosamine and HbA1c measurements. No differences were detected in mean fructosamine and HbA1c levels in non-diabetics patients in the CAPD or conservatively treated groups compared to controls. In diabetic patients undergoing conservative treatment or CAPD, mean fructosamine and HbA1c values were elevated when compared with control group. Both glycemic indicators were increased in most of the diabetic patients, was higher values in those patients with higher MBG. There was a good correlation in CAPD diabetic patients between fructosamine and HbA1c with MBG of the 21 previous days (r = 0.84, p less than 0.01 and r = 0.74, p less than 0.01 respectively). There was also correlation between fructosamine and HbA1c in CAPD diabetic patients (r = 0.78, p less than 0.01). We conclude that fructosamine does not seem to be influenced by uremia or by CAPD. Fructosamine and also glycosylated hemoglobin, when c-fraction is measured and HPLC method is used, can be utilized as glycemic indexes in CAPD diabetic patients.","1274":"We studied the serum levels and peritoneal transport of prolactin in 13 CAPD patients and compared with 8 patients on hemodialysis and 10 normal subjects matched by age (30-78 years), sex, body mass index and serum glucose concentrations. CAPD and hemodialysis patients were matched also by hematocrit, serum creatinine, albumin concentrations and duration and dialysis (0-79 months), the prolactin levels in serum and in effluent were measured by RIA and NB2 bioassay. CAPD patients had higher serum prolactin levels than did hemodialysis-treated patients and control subjects. The bioactive\/immunoactive ratio of serum prolactin in CAPD patients was 0.7 +\/- 0.1 versus 0.9 +\/- 0.1 in the control subjects (P less than 0.05) and 0.8 +\/- 0.04 in the hemodialysis patients, mean +\/- SEM. A significant linear correlation was demonstrated between serum levels and 8 hr peritoneal mass transfer of this hormone. A notable drop of prolactin took place after the first hour of dialysis. Serum prolactin was not influenced by peritoneal protein loss, glucose absorption rate or duration of CAPD. From this study we may conclude that hyperprolactinemia associated with CAPD is not affected by continuous peritoneal loss of prolactin, demonstrating only a slight decrease in bioactivity.","1275":"CAPD is not a physiological condition. The continuous absorption of glucose from the dialysate and the losses of nutrients like protein in it may cause many metabolic abnormalities. This review deals with some effects of CAPD on carbohydrate, lipid and protein metabolism.","1276":"Gemfibrozil was given at a daily oral dose of 600 mg to 28 CAPD patients with serum triglyceride levels higher than 200 mg\/dl, after 2 months of low fat low calorie diet. Eleven patients dropped out from the study due to spontaneous withdrawal of the drug or to intercurrent hospitalization. The 17 patients who completed the study showed a significant decrease in serum total (434.6 +\/- 207.9 to 237.5 +\/- 81.6 mg\/dl, p 0.003), VLDL (268.8 +\/- 17.8 to 109.2 +\/- 66.9 mg\/dl, p less than 0.005) and LDL (152.9 +\/- 34.6 to 119.2 +\/- 30.7 mg\/dl, p = 0.004) triglyceride. Serum VLDL cholesterol increased from 108.7 +\/- 54.1 to 59.9 +\/- 29.0 mg\/dl, p = 0.003. Serum HDL cholesterol decreased from 25.4 +\/- 4.8 to 35.3 +\/- 6.3 mg\/dl (p less than 0.001). Apo A1 increased from 117.8 +\/- 16.7 to 130.8 +\/- 16.7 mg\/dl (p less than 0.001) and Apo B increased from 173 +\/- 26.7 to 137.8 +\/- 21.9 mg\/dl (p less than 0.001). No clinical or laboratory side effect was observed in the patients who completed the study. Therefore dropouts were due to the poor patients' compliance rather than to the severity of side effects.","1277":"At start of dialysis most patients have histological bone abnormalities. These can be divided into two groups--high turnover and low turnover bone disease. Low turnover aplastic disease was previously attributed to aluminum accumulation but is now known to occur even in patients with less than 5% surface stainable aluminium. It is characterised by a mineralisation defect, thin osteoid seams, decreased numbers of osteoclasts and osteoblasts and absent aluminium staining. We have avoided aluminium containing phosphate binders (ACPBs) completely, with a combination of oral calcium carbonate and \"low calcium\" (1.25 mMol\/l) dialysis fluid. Phosphate control has been good (mean less than 1.6 mMol\/l) and over the first twelve months serum PTH levels have fallen significantly. Transient asymptomatic episodes of hypercalcaemia have occurred but no patient required ACPBs. Bone biopsies at the start of CAPD in 34 patients showed over 50% to have osteitis fibrosa (OF) but in five cases (15.6%) the aplastic lesion was found without aluminium staining. In seven follow-up biopsies OF improved in 3 cases, osteomalacia improved in 1, became aplastic in 1, while aplastic bone worsened in 1 and changed to mild OF in 1. We conclude that the predominant bone lesion in our patients at start of CAPD is OF, but 15% already have aplastic bone. \"Low calcium\" dialysis fluid enables ACPBs to be avoided in the majority of CAPD patients.","1278":"Nervous system dysfunction remains a major cause of disability in patients with end stage renal disease. The mechanisms remain unclear, but elevated levels of parathyroid hormone (PTH) have been proposed to act as a neurotoxin in uremia. Previous studies have mainly used electroencephalographic techniques to assess mental performance in patients in dialysis. This study utilized the trail test A and the Pennsylvania bimanual dexterity work sample to evaluate mental performance of patients in CAPD and to correlate their performance with parathyroid hormone levels. Ten male patients from the same CAPD unit, with comparable dialysis dose, underwent standardized testing. Subjects had a mean +\/- SE age of 50.8 +\/- 3.66 years and had been on CAPD for a mean of 42.4 +\/- 12.2 months. Each used 10-12 liters of dialysis per day, with a mean peritoneal dialysis index of 1.04 +\/- 0.05 and Kt\/V (UN\/wk) of 2.35 +\/- 0.39. Mental performance of patients with lower intact PTH levels 151.7 +\/- 20.8 ng\/ml (Group 1) was 34.4 +\/- 2.8 min in the trail test A and patients with the higher PTH-mm level (414.0 +\/- 21.4 ng\/ml) was 58.2 +\/- 10.8 min (p = 0.06). Whereas the bi-manual dexterity test was completed in 7.27 +\/- 0.5 min by Group 1 and in 11.1 +\/- 0.2 by Group 2 (p = 0.003). This study favors the hypothesis that PTH levels may be associated with the impaired mental performance observed in patients with end stage renal disease.","1279":"The presence of cellular growth factors in peritoneal effluents from CAPD patients have been described. The purpose of this paper has been to evaluate the effects of mitogenic activity of peritoneal effluents of the in vivo and in vitro additions of Calcitriol, EPO and IFN. These drugs were added to nocturnal peritoneal dialysate (in vivo) and to nocturnal effluent (in vitro) and then these fluids were tested for mitogenic-induced capacity on mice and human fibroblasts in culture. Our data show that the addition of Calcitriol and Erythropoietin have little effects on peritoneal effluent behaviour. Interferon alpha-2b seem to be useful for decreasing human fibroblasts growth.","1280":"Osteocalcin (OC) is a bone-specific protein whose blood concentration is a specific and sensitive marker of bone turnover. In adults undergoing continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), mean serum osteocalcin levels (S-OC) are lower than in similar patients on hemodialysis. We therefore measured the serum (S) and dialysate (D) levels of OC, estimated the peritoneal clearance (Cp) and mass transfer (MT) of OC and evaluated the relationship between S-OC levels and other serum biochemical parameters of bone metabolisms. Fourteen adult patients on CAPD were studied with a mean age of 46.3 +\/- 13 years and a mean dialytic age on CAPD of 17.4 +\/- 9.6 months. OC concentrations in (S) and (D) were 60.8 +\/- 55.5 micrograms\/l (normal range: 4.3-12.4 micrograms\/l) and 6.9 +\/- 6.2 micrograms\/l, respectively. The Cp of OC was 1.08 +\/- 0.3 ml\/min and the MT of OC over 4-h dialysis exchange periods was 14.5 +\/- 12.3 micrograms when using a dialysis solution containing 2.27% glucose. S-OC was significantly correlated with serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (r = 0.80), intact PTH (r = 0.82) and the MT of OC (r = 0.94). No significant correlations were found with serum levels of total calcium, phosphate, creatinine, total protein and dialytic age. These results suggest that the OC level in serum is influenced by both bone turnover and peritoneal clearance. Therefore, altered serum levels of OC should be interpreted always together with the peritoneal mass transfer of OC. Taking this into account, OC and intact PTH may be of value as markers of increased bone turnover secondary to renal osteodystrophy in CAPD.","1281":"Due to toxic side effects of aluminum-containing agents for treatment of uremic hypophosphatemia, much interest has been focused upon aluminum-free phosphate binder alternatives. From results of experimental studies with calcium acetate, this salt has been suggested as a possible effective and safe phosphate binder. In the present study, calcium acetate was used during a mean of 11 months for serum phosphate control in 30 uremic patients previously treated with aluminum and\/or calcium carbonate. Satisfactory control of serum phosphate was achieved during the study (mean phosphate concentration +\/- SE: 2.15 +\/- 0.12 mmol\/l compared to prestudy 2.23 +\/- 0.19 mmol\/l). Mean serum concentrations of calcium, alkaline phosphatase and parathyroid hormone did not change significantly during the study. Serum aluminum decreased significantly (p less than 0.01). Moderate hypercalcemia was observed in 6 patients. Calcium acetate treatment was withdrawn in 2 patients due to gastrointestinal discomfort. It is concluded that calcium acetate seems to be an effective phosphate binder alternative with relatively few side effects.","1282":"Thirteen patients were studied on two random occasions in order to evaluate the relationship between 1) volume and rate of dialysis outflow and the subsequent inflow, 2) patient's impression of the location of the catheter tip, and 3) stability of the catheter tip location. Outflow with the catheter tip located in the middle part of the abdomen was significantly lower than with the tip located in the inferior quadrants (p less than 0.02). No catheter tips were located in the far upper regions of the abdomen. Only one patient was able to state the exact location identical to fluoroscopy. 92% of the fluoroscopic evaluations showed that catheter tips were located in the same anatomical region in the upright as well as in the supine position. If vertical \"neighbour\" anatomical regions were included in the evaluation of the catheter tip migrations, all catheter tips were located in the same or the vertical \"neighbour\" region at the two study periods.","1283":"The important variables which determine peritoneal clearances include: residual volume, cycle volume, and cycle frequency. Various combinations of these variables result in CAPD, IPD, and TPD schedules. We decided to develop an animal model in which the clearances of these modes could be compared, performing dialysis on awake dogs with normal kidney function. In five successive experiments, two silicone catheters were placed in the abdomen of anesthetized dogs, one in the lower abdomen and one between the liver and diaphragm. On successive days, with the dogs awake but lying down, CAPD, IPD, and TPD schedules were performed for 4 hours, using 1.5% Inpersol (Abbott Laboratories, IL.). For CAPD the infused volume was 2 liters, drained at 4 hours. For IPD, 2 liters were infused and drained each hour. For TPD, one liter residual was infused, and another liter infused and drained each 20 minutes, to result in a 3 liter\/hour flow-through-rate. The dialysance of glucose (Dglu) was calculated from changes in dialysate and blood glucose concentration. Dglu reproducibly predicted the Durea, with Dglu = 0.6 Durea. Our experiments demonstrated that without efforts to optimize TPD, its dialysance is similar to that of standard TPD. The higher average TP volume of TPD offsets the higher fluid flow rate of TPD schedules. Both IPD and TPD have higher dialysance than CAPD.","1284":"In a retrospective study over three years, 23 patients were provided with a swan-neck Tenckhoff catheter (SNC) and 49 patients (control group) with a straight Tenckhoff catheter (STC) at the beginning of CAPD and were observed over a follow-up period of 608 patient-months. The aim of the study was to examine the reduction of complications in the course of CAPD with SNC resulting from technical causes, such as catheter dislocations, infections at the catheter's point of exit, the tunnel and the peritoneum. The causes of renal insufficiency, the reasons for choosing CAPD as a dialytic procedure, the causes of catheter loss as well as the frequency of infections associated with CAPD were analyzed. The main reasons for catheter loss were peritonitis and dislocations. In the SNC group a significant reduction of dislocations to 8.7% was observed as against 26.5% with STC. On the other hand, with SNC significantly more cases of peritonitis were observed in terms of statistics, with 1.1 episodes per patient-year (EOP\/PY) compared with 0.3 EOP\/PY with STC. The frequency of the exit site and tunnel infections and the cumulative survival probability of the catheters did not differ. The SNC is an interesting alternative to the STC; however, the expectations were only partly met.","1285":"Studies were performed to quantify the microbial population reduction achieved with the Peritoneal Dialysis Moist Heat Device (PDM-1). This microwave method is used to disinfect the inner lumen of connectors used in the exchange process for continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The microwave heating technique was evaluated on different connector systems containing a suspension of 10(6) microorganisms. The most prevalent and most problematic peritonitis-causative microorganisms were tested. After heating, the degree of disinfection was measured by enumerating bacterial colonies of the treated suspension. D-value determinations were then performed. The D-value for spores of A. niger was found to be 7.1 seconds for one type of connector system. Two other connector systems containing different intraluminal solution volumes were also tested using spores of A. niger and D-values were determined to be 7.6 seconds and 9.5 seconds, respectively. Other organisms tested were determined to have D-value times shorter than that for A. niger. Rapid heating of the solution contained within the CAPD connectors is a key characteristic of the microwave technique since temperatures rise high enough for destruction of microorganisms while leaving the plastic safe to touch. Thus, this technique is a safe and effective method for providing intraluminal disinfection.","1286":"A retrospective study was conducted in 20 Canadian hospitals to assess peritonitis rates of CAPD patients utilizing the SCD 210 patient assist device during a 30 month study period. A total of 175 patients having a cumulative SCD experience of 1,494 patient months were included in the survey. Sixty-eight patients experienced 116 episodes of peritonitis, i.e., one episode every 12.9 patient months (pt mo). Patients that had used the SCD for their entire CAPD experience had a significantly lower peritonitis rate (1\/15.2 pt mo) compared to patients who had used other CAPD systems (1\/10.1 pt mo). Peritonitis rates for diabetic study patients or patients with impaired vision and\/or dexterity were not significantly greater than non-diabetic or non-impaired study patients. Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus aureus were the most frequent causative microorganisms, accounting for 27.7% and 16.0% of peritonitis episodes caused by single organisms, respectively. The proportion of peritonitis caused by skin commensals was consistent across all study patients, regardless of impairment of vision and\/or dexterity. The study results demonstrate the successful application of this patient assist device in a CAPD population that consisted of a large proportion of high risk patients.","1287":"We review experience with 238 patients over 5.5 years to determine the impact of techniques of spiking dialysis bags in advance of their use (pre-spiking) on peritonitis incidence. Our two units provide peritoneal dialysis therapies only with liberal patient acceptance policies. The Y-set was used almost exclusively over the last 4 years (192\/238 patients), peritonitis rate 1:31.5 patient-months (99 episodes\/3,122 months). Nineteen patients spiked each exchange, 23 episodes\/282 months, 1:12.3; 173 pre-spiked 1-14 days in advance using Y-set and compact exchange device (CXD), 76 episodes\/2,840 months, 1:37.4. Peritonitis rates did not worsen with increased pre-spiking intervals: 1 day, 1:16.2; 2-6 days, 1:47.9; 7 days, 1:62.2; 8-14 days, 1:34.3. Similarly, pre-spiking in CCPD patients at 10 day intervals (4 patients) yielded a peritonitis rate of 1:19. We conclude that pre-spiking dialysis bags using the Y-set and CXD promotes significant peritonitis prevention. By spiking at less frequent intervals, technical performance improves, exchanges are simplified and done under more flexible circumstances. Participation by patient-assistants is facilitated. Transfer from CAPD to CCPD is decreased. Low peritonitis rates contribute to excellent patient acceptance and retention. The potential CAPD-eligible population is broadened.","1288":"The Single Use Y set is a disposable CAPD system that incorporates the use of a Quick Disconnect Clamp (QDC) for external occlusion. The system is designed using two types of twist lock connectology. The twist lock bag connector located at the distal end of the set is designed with a flange that provides a safety shelf for proper hand position during bag connection. The proximal patient connector on the Y set is a twist lock design requiring placement of povidone-iodine in the disinfectant chamber of the connector prior to patient connection. The Single Use Y is discarded after use.","1289":"Both CAPD-Y and CCPD have been reported to reduce the high peritonitis rate of conventional CAPD. As peritonitis was the major complication of CAPD in our centre, both modifications were introduced in 1987. Initially, treatment modalities were allocated to patients based on their (doctor's) preference. A remarkable difference in peritonitis rate was encountered between patients on CCPD and those on CAPD-Y (0.6 vs 1.2 episodes a year). As patient selection and doctor's preference might have contributed to this hopeful result, a prospective study was started. From January 1988 on, all new patients were at random assigned to CAPD-Y or CCPD in order to study the incidence of peritonitis in relation to the treatment modality. Up till November 1, 1990, 26 patients enrolled in the CAPD-Y group (follow-up of 292 patient months), and 30 patients in the CCPD group (follow-up of 337 patient months). This ongoing study reveals that CCPD patients remained peritonitis free significantly longer than those on CAPD-Y (quartile time to first peritonitis greater than 12 vs 3 months, p less than 0.05), and had a significantly lower peritonitis incidence (median time to second peritonitis 18 vs 6 months, p = 0.016). In conclusion, in an unselected patient population CCPD was accompanied with a significant lower peritonitis incidence than CAPD-Y.","1290":"In order to test the efficacy of the Del Clamp as a contamination barrier, the following protocol was carried out. Sixty bags of dialysate (1.5 L, 1.5% Dextrose) were connected to matching disposable Y sets and 100 mL of dialysate allowed to flow into each drain bag, after which the clamps were closed. The bags were arranged in groups of 10 and each group was inoculated with 1 mL of a standard suspension of S. aureus, S. epidermidis, E. coli, E. faecalis, P. aeruginosa and C. albicans, respectively. 3 bags were inoculated and left with the clamp open as controls. After 6 hr, incubation at 37 degrees C, 20 mL duplicate samples from each drain bag were centrifugated and processed for anaerobic and aerobic culture. None of the specimens taken from the sets grew bacteria or fungi. All the drain bags of the control sets grew the inoculated organism. We conclude that the Del Clamp makes CAPD safer by working as an effective contamination barrier and eliminating a potential for combination during the dialysis exchange.","1291":"Acinetobacter species are pleomorphic nonfermenting aerobic Gram negative bacilli which are important organisms causing peritonitis in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). We describe the characteristics and outcome of Acinetobacter peritonitis (AP) over an 18 month study period. There were 13 episodes of AP (9 identified as variant anitratus, 1 as variant calcoaceticus, 1 as variant, 1 woffi and 2 unspecified) in 11 patients (7 females and 4 males, mean age +\/- SEM, 50.1 +\/- 4.2 years), accounting for 14.3% of the total number of episodes of peritonitis. Technique failure accounted for 8 cases of AP. The duration of CAPD before the onset of AP ranged from 2 to 13 months. Three patients had AP one month after a different episode of peritonitis. Treatment was successful with intraperitoneal (IP) gentamicin alone in 9 episodes, oral perfloxacin alone in 2, and combination IP ceftazidime and oral perfloxacin in 1. Nine patients responded to treatment without interruption of CAPD. Two patients who were treated with IP gentamicin alone had second episodes of AP 2 and 4 months after treatment and 1 patient converted to hemodialysis because of bowel adhesions after his second episode of AP. One patient had Candida superinfection after clearance of AP. In conclusion AP is a common cause of peritonitis and can be treated in most cases without interruption of CAPD and catheter removal. The use of oral quinolones may be more convenient and equally effective. Diabetes mellitus and technique failure may be important factors.","1292":"The efficacy of streptokinase to lyse biofilm in the catheters of CAPD patients with peritonitis was examined in a retrospective review of 10 infusions in 9 patients with difficult to resolve peritonitis. 750,000 units of streptokinase were used. This helped resolve peritonitis in 8 of 10 uses, including two cases due to gram negative bacteria. Staphylococcus was cultured in the other 8 cases. The two episodes which failed to respond were due to Staph epidermidis relapsing peritonitis and required either catheter removal or two additional courses of antibiotics before peritonitis resolved. One infusion was complicated by severe hypotension which was thought to be due to generalized sepsis. The patient had received a previous streptokinase infusion but skin tests for IgE allergy to streptokinase were negative. We conclude that streptokinase is efficacious in the resolution of slow to resolve peritonitis due to either gram positive or gram negative organisms, and potentially saved seven patients from catheter removal.","1293":"In patients undergoing CAPD treatment, removal of peritoneal catheters has become a standard practice after two or more episodes of recurrent peritonitis which are refractory to antibiotic treatment. Immediate replacement of peritoneal catheters is not always safe in the presence of active peritonitis. Temporary institution of hemodialysis treatment in some of these patients may also be impossible because of unstable hemodynamic states or loss of vascular access sites. Successful continuation of CAPD treatment in some of these patients has been reported by using intraperitoneal (IP) administration of fibrinolytic agents such as streptokinase or urokinase as an adjunctive therapy to antibiotic treatment and as an outpatient procedure. Although numbers of cases reported are few in the literature and controlled studies in large numbers of patients are lacking, these reports emphasize the safety of IP use of these agents without any major systemic adverse effects. The reports are reviewed here to provide some practical guidelines for safe use of these agents in selected patients with recurrent CAPD-associated peritonitis.","1294":"To study the significance of biofilm bacteria in CAPD peritonitis, in a preliminary study, we compared the growth of planktonic and biofilm bacteria by parallel cultures of the same PD effluent in 14 patients with CAPD-associated peritonitis. Planktonic bacteria were isolated by routine microbiologic culture techniques and biofilm bacteria by the use of a modified Robbins' device (MRD). Antibiotic sensitivity or MIC's of bacterial strains isolated by the two techniques were compared. This comparison of the IC identified a subgroup of patients who developed recurrent antibiotic resistant biofilm-induced peritonitis and their peritoneal catheters were subsequently removed.","1295":"Aggressive nutrition has been reported to improve growth parameters in children undergoing peritoneal dialysis. The current study reports the effect of a program of aggressive nutrition, started in 1\/1988, on catheter-related infection rates in children undergoing chronic peritoneal dialysis. A combination of high calorie foods, supplements, \"candy bar diets\", and, when necessary, modular gastrostomy feedings, to provide 3-4 gm\/kg\/d and 100-120 kcal\/kg\/d was used. Peritonitis and catheter infection rates were assessed. A total of 37 pediatric patients underwent peritoneal dialysis from 1\/1986-7\/1990, with a total cumulative experience of 596 patient months. The peritonitis rate decreased from 1 episode\/5.53 patient-month in 1987 to 1 episode per 46 patient-month in 1990. There was no significant effect on the catheter infections or the number of admissions\/patient month. However, there was a 55% decline in the number of hospitalization days\/patient month (p less than 0.01). The decrease in the peritonitis rate was independent of the modality of peritoneal dialysis or the usage of ultraviolet connecting devices. In 10 patients followed sequentially, the peritonitis rate was less (1 episode\/23.5 patient months) after gastrostomy tube placement and feedings than before gastrostomy tube placement (1 episode\/8.28 patient months) (p less than 0.01). There were no significant differences in serum albumin or total protein levels between the two observation periods. We conclude that adequate nutrition may play a role in decreasing the peritonitis rate in children maintained on peritoneal dialysis and speculate improved white cell function as a possible underlying mechanism.","1296":"The carboxyterminal propeptide of type I procollagen (PICP) and the aminoterminal propeptide of type III procollagen (PIIINP) are split products related to formation of granulation tissue. Local concentrations reflect the state of fibrosis activity. PICP and PIINP were measured in serum and dialysate from 13 CAPD patients. One patient had 5-fold higher PICP and 8-fold higher PIIINP in the dialysate than the 12 other patients receiving CAPD. One month after the samples were collected, the patient was taken off CAPD due to sclerosins peritonitis. Our observation indicates that determinations of PICP and PIIINP in the dialysate could be useful markers of peritoneal fibrosis.","1297":"Though glucose is universally applied as osmotic agent in CAPD, there is great interest in the use of alternative osmotic agents. Glycerol-containing peritoneal dialysis fluids (G-PDF) have been used in an attempt to minimize the metabolic effects of long-term exposure to glucose, especially in patients with diabetes. Since data were lacking, we studied the effect of G-PDF on peritoneal macrophage (PMO) function. In a randomized cross-over setting eight stable diabetic CAPD patients performed the third and fourth exchange of the day with either G-PDF or with glucose-containing PDF (D-PDF) of comparable osmolality. The next day the patients who had used G-PDF were switched to D-PDF and vice versa. PMO were isolated from the effluents and tested for their phagocytic capacity and chemiluminescence response. No differences were encountered in total and differential white cell counts between G-PDF and D-PDF effluents. PMO phagocytic capacity for both S. epidermidis (SE) and E. coli (EC) was significantly depressed after the instillation of G-PDF as compared to D-PDF (SE: 52 +\/- 2.7 vs 69 +\/- 5.0%, p less than 0.02, and EC: 44 +\/- 5.7 vs 63 +\/- 6.7%, p less than 0.02). The same held true for peak chemiluminescence response (5.3 +\/- 1.36 vs 7.2 +\/- 1.43% of control cells, p less than 0.005). Thus, G-PDF may compromise PMO function in vivo more than D-PDF despite its more favourable metabolic profile as compared to D-PDF for diabetic patients.","1298":"Previous in vitro studies have revealed that the currently used peritoneal dialysis fluids (PDFs) inhibit several functions of phagocytic cells. Glucose-mediated hypertonicity was demonstrated to be one of the major detrimental factors. To investigate the clinical relevance of these in vitro findings, we compared the in vivo effect of a PDF with 3.86% glucose (D386) and a PDF containing 1.36% of glucose (D136) on peritoneal macrophage (PMO) function in eight CCPD patients. In a randomized cross-over setting, each patient used exclusively D136 or D386 on day one. The next day the patients who used D136 were switched to D386 and vice versa. PMO were isolated from the effluents and studied for their phagocytic capacity and chemiluminescence response. PMOs obtained from D386 effluents were significantly less phagocytic as compared to PMOs obtained after the in vivo use of D136 (38 +\/- 7.1 vs 63 +\/- 8.3%, p less than 0.02). In addition PMOs exposed to D386 were less able to mount a respiratory burst (peak response 4 +\/- 1.0 vs 15 +\/- 1.4% of control cells, p less than 0.05). Thus, the in vivo use of D386 was accompanied by significantly decreased PMO functions. These findings further stress the need to search for alternative solutions that do not rely on glucose-mediated hypertonicity for ultrafiltration.","1299":"The magnitude of response to lipopolysaccharide (LPS) by cells isolated from peritoneal dialysate (PDC) (n = 29) was compared to the response of monocytes (M) from hemodialysis (HD) patients (n = 8) and from normals (n = 9). Further studies compared monocyte (M) and PDC from 8 peritoneal dialysis (PD) patients, with adherence purification of PDC. The cells were cultured at 5 x 10(5)\/ml with varying LPS concentrations for 1, 2, 8, 20 and 48 hrs. TNF was measured by L929 assay, PGE2 by RIA and Il-1 beta by ELISA. The data demonstrate a defect in the stimulated response of TNF and Il-1 beta by M from both HD and PD patients. A similar defect is also present in PDC. By contrast PGE2 response to stimulation with LPS does not differ in M from HD and normals. For TNF and PGE2 the depressed response of the PDC may be explained by the lower percentage of macrophages (M phi) if adherence purification has not been carried out. However Il-1 beta production by adherence purified M phi is significantly lower than monocytes, although greater than non-adherent cells. We describe alterations in uremic M and M phi function which may contribute to the clinically observed immune defect in uremia.","1300":"Peritoneal macrophages from uninfected continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients in general show two different, endogenous peroxidatic activity (PA) patterns: exudate and negative. This suggests, in accordance with the animal model, that a chronic inflammatory state is present in CAPD patients, which may be caused by mechanical stimulation or the dialysis fluid. Therefore we studied in the rat model the intraperitoneal (i.p.) administration of peritoneal dialysis fluid and physiological saline. Our results on the number of neutrophilic granulocytes, the number of macrophages and the PA pattern indicate that a single i.p. administration of commercial dialysis fluid induced an acute exudate, especially when compared with the minor saline effect. These results are confirmed by the lower percentage of macrophages positive for the differentiation antigen ED2 and in addition the higher number of Fc-receptor positive peritoneal cells, when compared with the saline effect. These findings strongly suggest that the continuous administration of the dialysis fluid, as used in CAPD patients, is the inducer of the chronic inflammatory exudate in these patients.","1301":"Studies have suggested that oral quinolones may be useful in the treatment of peritonitis in peritoneal dialysis. We undertook a study of organisms causing peritonitis in our IPD and CAPD populations to determine if these organisms would be susceptible in vitro to Cipro. We determined the minimal inhibitory concentrations (MIC) of 62 non-duplicate isolates from episodes of peritonitis to Cipro by standard broth microdilution. Serial dilutions were done with Cipro and MIC50 and MIC90 were determined. The isolates were as follows: S, epidermidis (17), S. aureus (14), coliforms (11), Pseudomonas (8), Enterococci (8), Diphtheroids (4). The MIC50 and MIC90 for each of the isolate groups and overall are shown below.","1302":"CAPD peritonitis is most commonly due to gram positive infection. Gram negative bacillary infection is less frequent but is often seen in hospitalized patients or in those on antibiotics. Weeksella virosa (formerly known as Flavobacterium II F) has been isolated from the vaginal secretions and urine of normal women. As gram negative colonization typically proceeds from the perineal region, Weeksella virosa peritonitis might be expected in women at risk for gram negative peritonitis. A 33-year-old woman on CAPD developed multiply resistant Weeksella virosa peritonitis after prior hospitalization for pericarditis and antibiotic treatment for pneumonia. Cultures became negative and cell counts returned to normal during treatment with intravenous imipenem\/cilastin. Curative treatment was completed with intraperitoneal imipenem\/cilastin and oral ampicillin. Treatment was well tolerated despite theoretical concerns about the risk of seizures in patients with severe renal insufficiency not on hemodialysis.","1303":"Thirty-four patients on integrated double bag systems (IDBS) without disinfectants were compared with 33 patients on traditional single bag systems for incidence, probability of remaining free of peritonitis, type, and association of peritonitis (PE). In another 13 patients, the influence of a change in bag system was analyzed. On IDBS, the probability of remaining free of PE was 59% at 12 months and the incidence of PE was 0.44\/year (1\/27.3 months) while on traditional systems the probability of remaining PE free was 29% (p = 0.03) and the incidence was 1.06\/year (1\/11.3 months). The switch from single bag systems to IDBS decreased the incidence from 1.7\/year to 0.7\/year. The distribution of microbes that caused peritonitis on IDBS was different from patients on traditional systems, where the causative microbes were mainly coagulase negative Staphylococci. The use of IDBS decreased considerably the occurrence of infections caused by these skin bacteria. Some associated disorder (e.g., exit site infection, dental infection, broken transfer set) was found significantly more often in patients on IDBS. In conclusion, IDBS affect both the occurrence and type of PE by diminishing effectively intraluminal contamination by skin bacteria. Thus, other sources of infection have a proportionally greater significance.","1304":"In 1987 a preventive programme was initiated to address the problem of high hospital and community-acquired CAPD infection. It concentrated on reducing Staphylococcus aureus carriage, improving aseptic operative technique, intensive training for nursing staff and patients in stringent aseptic care of the exit site, and avoidance of contact of the exit site with unsterile water. This programme was associated with an overall 10-fold reduction in exit site infection, a 2-fold reduction in peritonitis, and a 4.5-fold reduction in catheter loss from infection. These reductions have been sustained. Preventing infection in CAPD patients requires persistence and commitment but improves the patient's quality of life and reduces the cost of treatment.","1305":"Peritonitis is the most common complication of peritoneal dialysis (PD). Staphylococcus epidermidis (S. epi), a common skin organism, is the microorganism that is identified is the majority of episodes of peritonitis. The PD catheter breaks the natural skin barrier and allows a periluminal migration of bacteria from the skin surface into the sterile peritoneal cavity. Exit site care is routinely performed to decrease the colony counts of microorganisms on the skin surrounding the PD catheter. Research data is limited to support any of the currently used protocols for exit site care. This study compared the effect of two antiseptic agents, povidone-iodine (P-I) and chlorhexidine gluconate (CG), on S. epi colony forming units (cfu) at the PD catheter exit site over a 24 hour period. Because the distribution of the research data was markedly non-normal, a descriptive approach was used to interpret the data. Results showed that there was no difference between P-I and CG immediately after exit site care. All patients had zero growth at Time I. One trend that emerged was that at 24 hours after exit site care with P-I, more patients (54%) had S. epi cfu than did patients (15%) cleaned with CG.","1306":"Grading of exit sites was performed at 265 routine outpatient visits of 28 patients starting CAPD between January 1988 and February 1990, with a total observation time of 398.5 months to December 1990. Six patients had no peritonitis episode. The remaining 22 patients suffered from 43 peritonitis episodes. Fifty-eight per cent of these were caused by Staphylococcus epidermidis. Eighty-six per cent of the examinations of exit sites of patients with peritonitis episodes showed 0 to 1 point on an arbitrary grading scale of up to 9 points. Staphylococcus aureus was found after bacterial culture from exit site smears in 3 cases. All were adequately treated. None of these cases showed any peritonitis episodes with this bacteria. No relationship could be found between the grading of the exit site at routine outpatient clinic visits and the appearance of a peritonitis episode. Grading of exit sites is of clinical importance but cannot predict the appearance of peritonitis.","1307":"As CAPD passes its 13 year mark as an ESRD therapy, a current controversy centers on whether it is the ideal treatment choice for almost all dialysis patients. Peritoneal dialysis has changed greatly since the late 1970s and now offers safer, more effective and varied types of treatment choices for patients. Concurrently, the patient population has changed and now includes older and more multiproblem patients than in the past. While some professionals may view CAPD as the best or even the only choice for most patients, it is important to realize that CAPD may not always be the best choice for either patients or staff. This paper looks at the controversy from the standpoint of both patient and PD staff. The question is raised as to \"should we\" rather than \"can we\" manage almost anyone on CAPD?","1308":"To determine which members of the health care team are viewed by ESRD patients as the most helpful in giving information and deciding on a dialysis modality, we surveyed 42 outpatients after they toured the dialysis facility. The tour included discussions with a social worker, PD and HD nurses, watching a videotape, and receipt of written materials. Nephrologists referred patients for tours. Multiple responses were accepted. Patients felt that social workers (70%) and nurses (71%) gave the most useful information. Fifty per cent of patients thought the nurse, 43% the social worker, 21% the nephrologist, and 21% family or friend most helpful in deciding on PD versus HD. Twenty-three patients chose PD, 16 chose in-center HD. Patients choosing PD were more likely to be white (20\/29 versus 3\/10, p less than 0.05) and employed (11\/23 versus 3\/16 choosing HD, p less than 0.10). Patients choosing PD were also better educated but this was not independent of race. No differences in gender, age, or the presence of diabetes were seen among those choosing PD versus HD. Social workers and nurses are more influential than nephrologists in helping patients select a dialysis modality. PD patient recruitment efforts should focus on social workers' and nurses' input.","1309":"Impaired cognitive function is part of an array of neurologic manifestations seen in patients with end stage renal disease. We investigated whether a difference exists in mental performance between patients on hemodialysis and on CAPD. The trial test A was administered in standardized fashion, and the time required to complete the test was used as a function of mental performance. A group of age and sex matched healthy controls was included for comparison. The results indicate that performance in the trail test A was markedly different among the three groups; controls did the test in 30.7 +\/- 2.4 sec (n = 17), CAPD in 47.2 +\/- 6.4 (p less than 0.05) and hemodialysis patients in 82.6 +\/- 11 (p less than 0.005). Patients on CAPD completed the test significantly faster than those on hemodialysis (p less than 0.05). This observation of a significantly better mental performance by patients in CAPD than in patients in hemodialysis is likely to be multifactorial, and its significance is unclear, but this may be of interest to the clinician and patients contemplating different dialysis modalities.","1310":"Although conventional wisdom advises removal of the Tenckhoff catheter as part of the therapy for tuberculous peritonitis, there are a few recent reports of cases successfully treated while maintaining the patients on CAPD. We wish to report three cases treated without interrupting CAPD. In two of the patients, cultures were positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and in the third case, although the cultures were negative, the patient improved on anti-Tb medications. Smear for AFB was positive in one patient; and two had a positive PPD. All had predominance of lymphocytes and monocytes in effluent. The total WBC count was 160-300 and two patients had fever. All had abdominal pain. One patient was treated with INH and ethambutol; one with INH and rifampin and one (who was suspected of being HIV+) also received pyrazinamide (PZA) until culture was available. Cultures grew in 4-6 weeks. All were started on therapy prior to having the culture results, and all showed clinical improvement within two weeks. One patient had his catheter replaced two months later because of pseudomonas peritonitis, continued on CAPD for an additional five months, then changed to HD because of recurrent bacterial peritonitis. One patient died of complications of diabetic vascular disease three months later with no evidence of peritonitis. One patient has remained on anti-Tb treatment for seven months and is doing well on CAPD.","1311":"","1312":"Thirty-eight hours of peritoneal dialysis (PD) was used in an 8-day-old, 3.35 kg boy with maple syrup urine disease (MSUD) to enhance the removal of branched chain amino acids (BCAA). PD clearances for leucine, isoleucine, and valine were 3 ml\/min\/1.73 m2, compared to urinary clearances of 0.16 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 (0.4 ml\/min\/1.73 m2 for isoleucine). The augmented clearance was reflected by a faster rate of fall in the plasma leucine level during dialysis (38 microM\/hr) than before or immediately after dialysis (10 microM\/hr). The biochemical improvement was accompanied by neurologic improvement in the baby. Once the leucine level fell to below 1500 mu + M, the unaugmented rate of fall for leucine (21 microM\/hr) was similar to that augmented by PD. Our experience demonstrates that PD is useful for enhancing clearance of BCAA at leucine levels greater than 1500 microM and that it speeds neurologic recovery.","1313":"To assess the normal range and the clinical significance of peritoneal IgG, the levels of these proteins were measured in 24 hour dialysates of 69 patients. The mean + SD of IgG levels was 7.2 +\/- 4.3 mg\/dl. Two patients had peritoneal IgG concentrations below and 6 above the mean +\/- SD range. There were no significant correlations between peritoneal IgG levels and sex, previous hemodialysis, age, time of dialysis, number of peritonitis or estimated daily protein intake. In 29 of these patients dialysate IgG levels measured again one year later did not show significant differences between the first and the second determination of IgG (from 6.3 +\/- 3.3 to 6.6 +\/- 3.2 mg\/dl), but changes of 10% or more were observed in 14 of these patients. Our data show no relation between peritoneal IgG and peritonitis episodes. Therefore by these results dialysate IgG cannot be used as a reliable index to decide which patients are at high risk for peritonitis.","1314":"Peritonitis requires a constant focus of infection plus the presence of foreign material, both amply present in the CAPD patient with an indwelling catheter and universal bacterial biofilm. Amazingly the great variety of potentially cytotoxic and immunodiluent agents with which the CAPD peritoneum is confronted on a daily basis does not produce the gross rate of sepsis that might be predicted. Clearly the profound reserve capacity of the peritoneal defense mechanisms, whose functions and interactions are poorly described and understood, contribute to the continuing success of the CAPD modality.","1315":"Our statistics reveal the average patient in our study to be a young black male with a history of IVDA with CAPD as the initial dialysis modality. He was most often trained on a mechanical assist device, but he still developed frequent peritonitis episodes, predominantly gram positive. His survival rate was less than 2 years, but he was able to remain independent until he died. Our fears about caring for the HIV infected individual cannot be denied. Even though we may never be truly comfortable when caring for someone with this disease, it is possible to train them to perform home peritoneal dialysis safely and effectively. By doing this, we can preserve the patients' independence and maintain their dignity while they cope with this overwhelming illness.","1316":"The Maslach Burnout Inventory (MBI) was used to determine whether peritoneal dialysis (PD) providers experience burnout. The questionnaire was completed by 55 physicians, 277 nurses and 4 other PD providers who attended the 9th Annual Conference on Peritoneal Dialysis. Our results show that burnout experienced by PD providers is comparable to that experienced by other providers in the medical field. Specific variables such as single martial status, full time employment and additional hemodialysis responsibilities were also identified as factors that may be associated with high degree of burnout.","1317":"Sclerosing peritonitis (SP) is an uncommon but serious complication of CAPD with various suggested etiology. We have documented 14 cases of SP in 18 CAPD patients using chlorhexidine in alcohol (ChA) in the connection procedure; 13 died. Nine of the 14 patients had been transferred to haemodialysis or renal transplantation, yet all still developed symptoms of SP within a few months after transfer even though 5 of them were originally asymptomatic. The main symptoms of SP were peritoneal ultrafiltration failure, exudative bloody ascites and intestinal obstruction. They present at around 5 years (30-80 months) after commencement of CAPD. Four other patients with a comparable duration of ChA exposure were continued on CAPD with a Travenol Spike System (TSS) without further exposure to ChA. They were all asymptomatic of SP after 9-12 months. Comparing the 2 groups of asymptomatic patients at 9 months after transfer, those transferred to TSS have a much better outcome than those transferred to HD or renal transplantation (P = 0.0476). We concluded that ChA is the main cause of SP in our patients and continuing CAPD without further exposure to ChA is a better alternative than stopping CAPD in preventing the progression of SP.","1318":"Many debilitated elderly patients are not currently considered for peritoneal dialysis because they cannot perform the procedure themselves and they lack adequate back-up support in the family or extended care facility. They often tolerate hemodialysis poorly, and may exhaust their vascular access sites. We have provided intermittent in-center staff-assisted cycler dialysis to two debilitated elderly patients for a total of 12 patient months. Initial peritoneal equilibration tests indicated high solute transport rates in both patients, and led us to evolve a regimen based on frequent cycles. We use a 4 days a week regimen, cycling 12-14 liters during a 7.5 hour period each day. The patients tolerated the treatment well, with improved control of fluid balance and maintenance or improvement in appetite compared to baseline periods of CAPD. Mean pre-treatment BUN is 87 mg\/dl. This is 29% higher than during CAPD, and has been stable. The requirement for additional nursing care has been variable but not disruptive of other activities once we established a dedicated space and routine. Current cycler technology permits consideration of in-center cycling as a practical alternative for many patients previously excluded from peritoneal dialysis.","1319":"The outcome of renal transplantation in CAPD patients is still controversial since age and clinical differences often make comparison with hemodialysis patients difficult. The aim of this study was to analyse two homogeneous groups of patients, on CAPD and on hemodialysis. 18 CAPD (Group A) and 18 hemodialysis patients (Group B) were selected for a case-control analysis, matched for age, presence of acute tubular necrosis and Cyclosporine A regimen. Group A and B were not different for male\/female ratio, donor age, HLA-Dr mismatches, arterial pressure, cold ischemia, or follow-up. Patient, graft survival and number of rejection episodes did not differ significantly at 1 year; serum creatinine at 6 and 12 months and CyA doses at 1 and 6 months were not different; hospitalization rates for first and subsequent admissions did not differ. Infection-free patients were 9\/18 in Group A and 15\/18 in Group B, with 12 episodes in Group A and 3 in Group B. Post transplant cholesterol levels showed a trend to increase in both groups and triglycerides levels to a decrease; differences in pre and post transplant in body weight were not significant at 12 months. In conclusion, the outcome of transplantation in CAPD patients is not significantly different from that in hemodialysis patients with similar clinical characteristics.","1320":"Dialysate leaks, which occurred in 386 CAPD patients over 11 years, were analyzed retrospectively. 18 patients developed 21 early leaks (within 30 days of catheter insertion) and 18 patients developed 28 late leaks (beyond 30 days of catheter insertion). 8 patients had multiple (2-6) leaks. Both early and late leaks, particularly if they were multiple, were associated with conditions that affect adversely tissue healing and tensile strength. Median surgical insertion was apparently associated with a higher incidence of early leaks. Early leaks were manifested externally, usually through the exit site, and did not require imaging. Late leaks were manifested usually by poor dialysate outflow, localized edema and subcutaneous fluid collections. One third of the late leaks required radiological imaging. Hernias caused 42% of the late leaks. Early leaks were managed by temporary discontinuation of CAPD alone (57%) or surgery. Most late leaks (67%) required surgery. Conservative means (change to IPD, observation) were applied for the management of a few late leaks. Both early and late leaks resulted frequently in replacement of peritoneal catheters, but only late leaks resulted in permanent discontinuation of peritoneal dialysis. Paramedian surgical insertion, waiting period of 10-14 days between catheter insertion and initiation of CAPD, and low starting dialysate volumes have resulted in apparent reduction of the incidence of the early, but not of the late leaks. Dialysate leaks have serious consequences on the performance of CAPD. Early leaks differ from late leaks in some clinical manifestations. Preventive measures have decreased the incidence of early, but not of the late leaks.","1321":"CAPD is a widely accepted therapy, however, some patients develop complications that can impede continued therapy. Peritonitis is the most critical problem. A series of complications require accurate examination to avoid discontinuing necessary therapy, i.e.: leakage, inguinal and ventral hernia, trauma, catheter malfunction and scrotal-penile edema. For the past few years we have used peritoneal x-ray to evaluate these complications. Recently we have included computerized tomography with intraperitoneal contrast. We have studied 20 patients since 1985. The empty peritoneal cavity is filled with 100 cc of iopamidol, a non-ionic, low osmolality contrast, containing 300 mg of iodine\/ml. No complications were ever encountered during or after these studies. The method has proven most useful in therapeutic decisions permitting, very often, continuing peritoneal dialysis. The results are extremely reliable due to its simplicity and the complete absence of complications.","1322":"Clinical course, complications and outcome were analyzed in 75 patients (14 women, 61 men) who started CAPD at age 55 years or older (55-81). These patients were separated in three groups. Group A patients had high risk for vascular disease (diabetes, hypertension, N = 45), group B patients had a presumed lower risk for vascular disease (primary renal disease, N = 22), and group C patients had miscellaneous conditions (N = 8). Group A was compared to group B. Patient and technique survival was statistically higher for group B than for group A. The rates of peritoneal dialysis related complications (peritonitis, tissue infections, catheter loss, hernias) were comparable between groups A and B. Hernias were seen frequently in all groups and had severe sequellae, including discontinuation of CAPD. Catastrophic vascular events were also seen in all groups, but the frequency of such events, particularly of catastrophic vascular events of the limbs, was statistically higher in group A than in group B. Vascular disease accounted for the majority of deaths in all groups. Four patients died from cardiovascular instability soon after changing from CAPD to hemodialysis. In conclusion, vascular disease is the major factor limiting survival in older CAPD patients. CAPD is superior to hemodialysis for a relatively small fraction of older patients with severe cardiovascular instability.","1323":"Advantages of CAPD in diabetic uremic patients may offer better control of visual and neurological disease. There remain some undesired side effects, i.e: obesity, blood lipid imbalance and loss of appetite due to glucose absorption. In February 1988 four diabetic uremic CAPD patients (2 males and 2 females with an average age of 62.25 +\/- 11.32, range 52-76) began treatment substituting one of the usual glucose exchanges with 1% aminoacid solution. Treatment time averaged 52 months (range 9-17). Each month the patients were examined clinically and via blood chemistries. Every 3 months clearances, residual renal function, ocular fundus and motor nerve conductance velocity were measured. Plasma nitrogen increased, while triglycerides, cholesterol and total protein remained unchanged; bicarbonate decreased causing slight acidosis. There were no significant variations of either clearances or ultrafiltration and the quantity of insulin administered decreased. Results confirm that a 1% aminoacid solution can be used as an osmotic agent in peritoneal dialysis to prevent some of the complications such as blood lipid imbalance. The slight acidosis can be corrected by increasing the buffer content of the bag.","1324":"A retrospective study was done in 86 patients on dialysis in order to evaluate the doses of aluminum hydroxide (OH3 Al) received to achieve a better serum phosphate control. Thirty-seven patients were treated with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) divided in 22 diabetics and 15 non-diabetics. Forty-nine patients were treated with hemodialysis (HD), 12 diabetics and 37 non-diabetics. The doses of 1-25 Dihidroxycholecalciferol (1-25 DOH-D3) were similar in all patients. The serum phosphate levels were similar in CAPD and HD patients with smaller doses of OH3 AL in CAPD patients (p less than 0.001). Diabetics on either technique need less OH3 AL in CAPD (CAPD p less than 0.01; HD p less than 0.05) to achieve the same or better control of serum phosphorus than non-diabetics. The overload of glucose on CAPD and the maintained hyperglycemia on diabetes mellitus would shift phosphorus into the cell and could explain these results. Finally, the less needs of aluminum hydroxide on diabetic patients could contribute to their protection against aluminum deposition and its effects.","1325":"","1326":"Peritoneal equilibration tests (PETs) in patients on CAPD show wide variations. To find out whether these are correlated with time on CAPD, we investigated changes in PET in 97 tests in 86 patients. 46 PETs were performed with a 1.36% glucose solution and 40 PETs with a 3.86% glucose solution at different time intervals. Neither did the intra-individual comparison of 11 patients with 1.36% glucose solution following 1 year of treatment show any significant change nor the inter-individual comparison following a treatment time of 1 and 2 years. There was also no difference using a 3.86% glucose exchange, when the results at the beginning and after 1 year were compared. However, alterations in equilibration ratios were significant after 24 and 36 months of treatment for creatinine (36 months versus 0: p less than 0.005), glucose absorption (36 months versus 0: p less than 0.01) and UF (36 months versus 0: p less than 0.01). No correlation exists between these changes either with the number of peritonitis episodes or with the time of treatment. Though, no single factor could be identified, patients had an increase in peritoneal permeability especially after long-term treatment. Further investigations are necessary to evaluate the reasons for these changes.","1327":"In vitro studies indicate that the culture medium Ca++ concentration conditions the response to erythropoietin of bone marrow erythropoietic cells which also have specific receptors for 1,25(OH)2D3. We therefore evaluated in 12 anemic CAPD patients: 1) in vitro with increasing concentrations of Ca++ alone or Ca++ plus 1,25(OH)2D3 a) Ca++ in the bone marrow erythroid cell cytoplasm; b) colony (BFU-E and CFU-E) growth from bone marrow erythroid cells. 2) in vivo before and after 24 weeks of i.v. recombinant human erythropoietin (rHuEPO) therapy a) bone marrow erythroid cell cytoplasmic Ca++; b) BFU-E and CFU-E growth. Results showed that in CAPD patients, in vitro cytoplasmic Ca++ in bone marrow erythroid cells, and BFU-E and CFU-E growth were lower than in normals and the addition of Ca++ caused a dose-dependent increase; 1,25(OH)2D3) potentiated these effects; 2, in vivo rHuEPO therapy normalized the aforementioned parameters. An inverse relationship was seen between the bone marrow erythorid cell cytoplasmic Ca++ levels before therapy and the duration of therapy necessary to correct anemia. These data underline the role of Ca++ and 1,25(OH)2D3 in erythropoiesis in uremic patients and may aid the understanding of the mode of action and the degree of response to rHuEPO in CAPD patients.","1328":"EPO is an effective therapy of anaemia in CAPD patients. Monitoring serum iron level during EPO therapy is essential. Hypertension is frequently seen in patients with EPO therapy.","1329":"After 6 months of (recombinant human erythropoietin) rHuEPO treatment we recently observed an increased peritoneal ultrafiltration (UF) (Nephron 53: 91, 1989). The aim of the present study was to investigate the long term effect of subcutaneous (SC) on dialysis efficiency in CAPD. Fourteen patients (11 female, 3 male, mean age 42.6, range 18-65 years) with renal anemia (HCT less than 28%) took part in the study. rHuEPO was administered s.c. twice weekly in an initial dose of 50 U\/kg body weight. This dose was increased by 25 U\/kg body weight every 4 weeks till the target HKT of 35% had been achieved. After 12 months of mean time of treatment (range 8-14 months) hematocrits had increased from 23.3 +\/- 3.2 (x +\/- SD) to 36.6 +\/- 5.3% (p less than 0.005). UF improved from 0.70 +\/- 0.22 to 1.03 +\/- 0.47 ml\/min (4 hr dwell time, 1.5% glucose monohydrate) (p less than 0.03). Increased UF resulted in an augmented creatinine clearance (p less than 0.05). No changes were observed in serum chemistries, body weight, pulse rate or cardiothoracic index. The observed increase in peritoneal ultrafiltration might be due to augmented mesenteric perfusion resulting from improved cardiac function. The sustained increase in UF after rHuEPO-induced correction of renal anemia may improve the fluid balance on CAPD patients.","1330":"This paper presents an interim report on the findings of the International Peritoneal Biopsy Registry (IPBR). The registry was set up for the collection and morphological examination of specimens of peritoneal tissue obtained at surgical implantation or removal of the catheter before, during or after treatment with continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). The key objective of the Registry is the accumulation of information on the effect of peritoneal dialysis, peritonitis and any other complication of the therapy, on the structural integrity of peritoneal mesothelium, stroma and blood vessels.","1331":"Three homogenous groups of CAPD patients, all of them with plasma hemoglobin levels lower than 8 g\/dl were studied. Group 1 included 8 patients who received EPO by the subcutaneous route (s.c), at doses of 20 u.\/kg daily; this dose was reduced when a hemoglobin level higher than 10.5 g\/dl was reached. Group 2 included 7 patients treated with EPO by subcutaneous route but at doses of 2000 units twice a week. Group 3 was constituted by 4 patients receiving EPO by intraperitoneal route (i.p.), at doses of 4000 u\/day, three days a week. All patients showed an increase in hematocrit and Hb levels after three months of treatment, but the mean EPO dose was quite different comparing the groups, maintaining the reached levels at the 9th month; reticulocyte count increased only during the first month. The rest of clinical and biochemical parameters did not suffer any significant modifications. Our features showed a higher profit, that is, higher increase in Hb level with lower dose of EPO in the s.c. group in respect to i.p. group. Furthermore, we have registered a marked increase in the frequency of exogenous peritonitis in these particular patients while using i.p. EPO. In conclusion, we feel that subcutaneous route for H-R-Erythropoietin is an ideal way for this treatment, resulting in a more adequate profit ratio than that described in hemodialysis patients. The intraperitoneal route is more expensive and risky for the peritoneum, probably as a consequence of the increase of manipulations.","1332":"Recombinant erythropoietin (R-EPO) administered i.v. is effective in correcting anemia in patients on hemodialysis (HD). As subcutaneous (s.c.) or intraperitoneal (i.p.) dosing would be preferable in CAPD patients, we have evaluated its efficacy when given by these routes. Sixteen CAPD patients (mean Hb 7.3 +\/- 1.6 g\/dl) have been divided into two groups: group A received s.c. self-administered R-EPO (starting dose 92 +\/- 35 U\/kg\/week) two times a week; in group B R-EPO was given i.p. (170 +\/- 42 U\/kg\/week) thrice weekly. The observation period lasted about 12 months. All patients reached a target Hb greater than 10 g\/dl. Group A achieved a full response within 9 +\/- 2 weeks, group B within 13 +\/- 1.7 (p less than 0.005). In group A the starting R-EPO dose was not changed; in group B it was increased to 225 +\/- 45 U\/kg\/week. We observed no differences in the incidence of peritonitis in the two groups. Our findings show that both R-EPO administration routes are safe and efficient in correcting anemia in patients on CAPD. A shorter period of treatment and lower doses of R-EPO seem to be required to achieve the same target Hb level when using the s.c. rather than the i.p. application route.","1333":"In vitro experiments were performed to analyze problems with the determination of erythropoietin in dialysate. Human recombinant erythropoietin (EPO; 4000 U\/L) was added to several fluids, to glass or polystyrene tubes with or without addition of bovine serum albumin (BSA) and to dialysate bags. The recovery in peritoneal effluent was 4120 +\/- 203 U\/L (mean +\/- SEM). The recovery in the other fluids was less than 50% but in glass tubes it increased to 96% after addition of BSA. Binding was also found to the dialysate bag, therefore reducing the amount available for absorption. We recommend that EPO samples from the dialysate are drawn within BSA coated glass tubes.","1334":"The Pediatric nephrologist is the infant patient's medical advocate, joining with the family to efficiently restore renal function and vigor to a child incapacitated by renal failure. In this context, renal transplantation, even in infancy, is an effective, available therapy holding the potential to improve the long term outcome for individual young children.","1335":"Long term dialysis in children with multiple handicaps has become easier with the advent of CAPD. In December 1986, an 11 year old with myelomeningocele in end stage renal disease secondary to chronic pyelonephritis required dialysis. Placement of a right ventriculoperitoneal shunt had been done at 4 months of age. Poor family compliance required placement in medical foster care. The peritoneal catheter was replaced three times. Leakage and infection were the major complications resulting in catheter replacement. In March 1988 the child required shunt extension due to accelerated growth after which she developed relapsing peritonitis requiring removal of the peritoneal catheter and externalization of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt. A proximal tap of the ventriculoperitoneal shunt prior to revision had a negative culture but glucose of 471 when serum glucose was 91. Six days after externalization of the shunt and catheter removal, the shunt was converted to ventriculoatrial and the PD catheter replaced. Nasogastic feedings and cycler dialysis became necessary due to worsening nutritional status and hyperabsorption. Successful transplantation occurred 28 months after initial dialysis.","1336":"Peritoneal dialysis catheters are at risk for exit-site contamination when swimming or bathing. Also in pre-toilet trained children fecal and urine contamination can occur. The use of Tegaderm dressings prevents contamination and thus minimizes restriction of activity in children.","1337":"The child who is tube fed during the first two years of life is at risk for impaired development of normal oral-motor patterns and coordination during feeding. In order to ensure as smooth a transition to oral feeding as possible, it is necessary to provide the tube-fed child with a framework of normal oral sensitization from which he can develop the level of trust in his own oral mechanism required to achieve the mature, coordinated oral movements essential to development of the normal bite-chew-suck-swallow sequence. While this can be a tedious and taxing process, an ongoing program of oral stimulation, training and development should be included in the overall management of every young child receiving tube feedings.","1338":"Experience with percutaneous gastrojejunostomy is described in children on chronic cycler peritoneal dialysis. We recommend this mode of enteral alimentation for children requiring caloric supplementation.","1339":"This 203-month experience with CPD and NG feedings in 14 small children weighing less than or equal to 10 kg at initiation of CPD for ESRD, provides evidence that CPD and vigorous nutritional therapy is effective in maintaining and improving growth until a successful renal transplant can be performed. Nutritional therapy should be initiated early, if possible when growth begins to decline even before the onset of ESRD and the need for CPD. Infants who are less than or equal to 4 months old at initiation of CPD are more likely to have a complicated clinical course and poor growth, despite the provision of CPD and vigorous nutritional support. More experience with this group of patients is needed to determine appropriate therapy.","1340":"Eight infants initiated chronic peritoneal dialysis and received nasogastric tube feedings during their first month of life. In each case, the nasogastric tube feedings were initiated because of poor oral intake and the desire to avert the development of an aversive feeding interaction between parent and child. The nutritional regimen was designed to allow normal or catch up weight gain appropriate for height age. The caloric and protein intake of the infants averaged 98.5 +\/- 10.2 kcal\/kg\/day and 2.7 gm\/kg\/day, respectively, during the first year of life. Between 25% and 100% of the formula intake was provided by the nasogastric route. Group standard deviation score for height was -1.74 +\/- 0.7 at one year. Five of the infants received behavioral therapy because of persistent food refusal. Therapy consisted of reinforcing prompted food acceptance and ignoring food refusal. This approach was conducted by a multidisciplinary team and successfully converted the non-oral feeder to a total oral feeding regimen in each case.","1341":"Twelve children with end stage renal disease requiring dialysis received enteral feedings via nasogastric (NG) or gastrostomy (G) tube between 1984 and 1989 for provision of adequate nutrition. Records were reviewed for frequency and types of complications seen. Six patients, ages 1 week to 16 months received NG feedings for a total of 32 months. Complications included persistent vomiting with recurrent aspiration (2), persistent vomiting with peritoneal dialysis (PD) exit site leak (1), sinusitis (1), and refusal to continue NG feeds because of patient\/parental anxiety (1). Three of the 6 were changed to G tube feedings after 2 days to 3 months. The complication rate was 1 per 6.4 patient months. Nine patients, ages 4 days to 11 years, received G tube feedings for 64 months. The complication rate was similar, 1 per 7.1 months. Complications were PD fluid leak around G tube exit site (1), G tube infection (2), G tube obstruction requiring tube replacement (3), tube migration producing intestinal obstruction (1), and gastrocutaneous fistula (2). Both methods were associated with similar complication rates, although somewhat different types of complications were seen. The young dialysis patient may have certain unique risks in addition to the complications generally associated with enteral feedings.","1342":"Platelet activity is closely related to endothelium and could release factors able to influence capillary wall and surrounding tissues. BTG is a protein included in platelet vesicles and a measure of its activation. Some alterations of peritoneum could be partially related to platelet activity. BTG peritoneal transport from blood is weight limited (36000) and consequently, high levels in effluent should represent local production. The aim of this study has been to characterize peritoneal effluent BTG.12 patients, on CAPD 27 +\/- 15 mon., 5 diabetics were studied. Previous peritonitis was 0.3 +\/- 0.4 e\/year. Determinations performed: Plasma (P) (BTG, T. protein, albumin, platelet count, Hcto and Fibrinogen) and Effluent (EF) (BTG, T. protein, Fibrinopeptide A, FDP, Fibrinolytic act., Fibrinogen, Plasminogen and Mitogenic induced capacity on Swiss 3T3 mice fibroblasts). To evaluate peritoneal function we used mass transfer coefficients (MTC) and net UF.R.:BTG levels: P 118 +\/- 14 EF 34 +\/- 14 ng\/ml P\/EF (%) 31 +\/- 13 (6-54%). Regression analysis: P BTG did not show significant relationship with any of the studied parameters. EF BTG showed direct significant correlation (p less than 0.05) with Creatinine-MTC (r: 0.81) and EF Fibrinogen (0.68) and in the limit of significance with EF T. prot (0.57) and EF Mitogenicity (0.62). P\/EF BTF showed significant correlation with creatinine-MTC (0.77). The analysis of these values grouping patients showed: diabetes has no influence on BTG values, hypertensive patients show higher P\/EF BTG values than normotensive (39 +\/- 9 vs 23 +\/- 11%, p less than 0.05) and no influences of peritonitis or CAPD period were found.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1343":"We feel that tube feeding children on CPD is an important and useful therapy to optimize their growth. Strategies to accelerate growth in such children by using human growth hormone are interesting and await scientific confirmation with controlled trials.","1344":"When selecting enteral feedings for infants and children on continuous peritoneal dialysis care should be taken to meet individual needs to provide for nutritional adequacy and normal growth rates. This requires a combination of complete feedings plus modules. The feedings should be evaluated frequently to adjust for growth and changes in renal function or treatment.","1345":"The current recommendations for the nutritional management of children treated with CAPD\/CCPD will be reviewed. The optimal caloric intake for pre-pubertal children undergoing dialysis should at least be determined by the recommended daily allowances (RDA) of the National Academy of Science for healthy children of the same height and age. For pubertal and post-pubertal patients, the prescribed energy intake is similar to the RDA for adolescents, 60 kcal\/kg for males, and 48 kcal\/kg\/day for females. Dietary complex carbohydrates should provide about 35% of dietary energy intake. Dietary fat should provide 50% of the dietary intake, and the PS:S fatty ratio should be about 1.5:1.0. The recommended protein intake for children less than 3 years of age should range between 2.5-3.0 gm\/kg\/day; for children between 3 years of age and puberty 2.5 gm\/kg\/day; for pubertal patients 2.0 gm\/kg\/day, and post-pubertal patients 1.5 gm\/kg\/day. In general, sodium, potassium and water intake vary markedly among patients and should be managed individually. Vitamins, folic acid 1 mg\/day; peridoxine, B6 5-10 mg\/day; and ascorbic acid 75-100 mg\/day. Vitamin D sterols (i.e., calcitriol) and phosphate binding agents mainly calcium carbonate are needed for the prevention and control of renal bone disease in such patients. Aluminum containing gels should be avoided in order to prevent aluminum accumulation secondary to the ingestion of aluminum containing gels.","1346":"Secondary hyperparathyroidism (HP) is well known complication of long-term uremia. CAPD patients show a peculiar behaviour due to loss of vitamin D metabolites through peritoneum. Severe degrees of hyperparathyroidism may require parathyroidectomy in order to achieve appropriate control. Recently, the possibility of controlling this situation with high oral doses of calcitriol has been communicated. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of this agent on hyperparathyroidism in CAPD patients. Two different groups were constituted according to the length of time on dialysis when HP was detected. All of the patients had i-PTH serum levels five times higher than the normal values (50 pg\/ml). During a six month period the daily dose of oral calcitriol was increased in order to achieve a reduction in i-PTH level. The results after this period showed a significant reduction in i-PTH levels (614 +\/- 378 to 241 +\/- 80 pg\/ml) with an average increase in oral calcitriol from 0.16 +\/- 0.1 to 0.67 +\/- 0.4 with no significant changes in serum calcium or phosphorus. The group with HP at start of dialysis achieved these effects easier and with lower doses of calcitriol. We conclude that moderately high doses of oral calcitriol control secondary hyperparathyroidism in CAPD patients without hypercalcemia.","1347":"The metabolism of lipids in CAPD has not been fully elucidated. To further clarify the behavior of dyslipidemia in this setting we followed the values of total cholesterol (TC), HDL-cholesterol (HDL-C) and apolipoprotein (apo) parameters over time (12-24 months) in 40 patients and correlated these values and their ratios with clinical (age, gender, race, weight, diabetes, etc.) and biochemical (multiphastic screen) information. Mean HDL-C was lower in men (p less than 0.04), in whites, (p less than 0.03) and in diabetic patients (p less than 0.05), but there were no group differences for mean total cholesterol, mean apolipoprotein values, the atherogenic risk ratio TC\/HDL-C, or the anti-atherogenic ratio apo A-I\/apo B. Total months on CAPD was found to correlate positively with TC\/HDL-C (p less than 0.05), an atherogenic risk factor, and to correlate negatively with HDL-C (p less than 0.02), an anti-atherogenic index. There was also a negative correlation with another anti-atherogenic index, apo A-I\/apo B, which did not reach statistical significance (r = -0.41, p = NS). Counterbalancing this apparently increased atherogenic risk is the stability of individual parameters for each patient over time in this study. In fact, the good news appears to be that TC, HDL-C, apolipoproteins and the risk ratios TC\/HDL-C and apo A-I\/apo B all remained stable over 12-24 months (p = NS by paired t-test for all). Thus, we find no evidence for worsening of the uremic dyslipidemia over time with CAPD treatment.","1348":"We analyzed the erythrocyte membrane lipid composition in 11 non-diabetic CAPD patients on treatment for 3-78 months and in a control group of 12 subjects. The mean total values of both saturated fatty acids and unsaturated fatty acids were not statistically different in CAPD patients and in controls but the composition of fatty acids of in cell membranes was altered. In fact, CAPD patients had a higher percentage of monounsaturated fatty acids and a lower percentage of polyunsaturated fatty acids than controls. This increase MUFA\/PUFA ratio might reflect either a preferential cell membrane uptake of MUFA or a relative PUFA deficiency due to an increased lipid peroxidation.","1349":"Ten patients with chronic hepatic disease (CHD) were compared with 34 non-CHD (N) pts. All patients underwent a peritoneal equilibration test; the asymptotic curves for small solutes transport were transformed into straight lines; protein transport was also expressed as a straight line; the slopes of these linear functions were used as index of solute transfer. CHD patients showed increased UF and transport of all solutes. The well-known relationships between UF and glucose absorption and between UF and dialysate sodium concentration were observed in N, but not in CHD patients. In patients without hepatic disease there was also a relationship between UF and the glucose transport slope, which was not observed in CHD pts. These results are probably due to the influence of hepatic lymph production plus increased lymphatic removal, observed in non uremic patients affected by cirrhosis, on the mechanisms of water and solute transport in CAPD. CHD patients can be managed either with CAPD or with short frequent exchanges. Ascites production can be evaluated by the difference between the observed UF in a patient with CHD and the expected UF in N patients.","1350":"Accelerated atherosclerosis is a serious complication of chronic renal failure (CRF) treated by peritoneal dialysis. In order to study the pathological mechanisms underlying its development we are using an animal model, namely the C57BL\/6J mouse, which develops foam cell-type atherosclerotic lesions after surgical induction of CRF. During atherogenesis, monocyte\/macrophages move from the circulation to the blood vessel wall, migrate through the endothelium, imbibe lipid and transform into foam cells. Migration through the endothelium involves proteolysis by plasminogen activator (PA) and uptake of lipids involves hydrolysis of lipoproteins by lipoprotein lipase (LPL). Both of these enzymes are secreted by macrophages. In this paper we report the results of studies on the effect of uremia on the secretion of PA and LPL by macrophages from C57BL\/6J mice. The secretion of PA and LPL by macrophages from uremic mice (as defined by BUN levels) was higher than that by cells from control animals. Furthermore, whereas macrophage secretion of PA and LPL was significantly less in normal mice fed a high fat diet than in mice fed rodent chow, it was increased above control levels in uremic animals fed the atherogenic diet. We conclude that increased secretion of PA and LPL by macrophages may contribute to atherogenesis in uremic C57BL\/6J mice.","1351":"Patients with end stage renal failure have elevated plasma levels of atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) which seems to be a sensitive parameter of body fluid status. A prospective study comparing patients on hemodialysis (HD) and continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) was still missing. Six identical patients (59 +\/- 10 yrs, residual diuresis 1.3 +\/- 0.61, 1 data expressed as means +\/- SEM) were studied in the predialysis phase and under steady state conditions on HD and on CAPD. Plasma levels of ANP, cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP), adrenaline, noradrenaline and dopamine were determined. Blood and dialysate samples were repeatedly taken. Ultrafiltration-volume, dry weight and blood pressure were not different between HD and CAPD. ANP and cGMP reached the highest plasma levels in the predialysis phase with 421 +\/- 180 pg\/ml and 19.8 +\/- 6.4 pmol\/ml and decreased after the onset of dialysis treatment. On HD mean ANP levels of 279 +\/- 175 pg\/ml were not significantly different from those on CAPD (320 +\/- 213 pg\/ml). However, cGMP concentrations on CAPD (15.7 +\/- 5.4 pmol\/ml) surpassed the values measured on HD (10.5 +\/- 3.4 pmol\/ml, p less than 0.05). Plasma noradrenaline was markedly elevated in the predialysis phase (421 +\/- 180 pg\/ml) and decreased under dialysis treatment. Differences between HD and CAPD were not found. Adrenaline and dopamine concentrations fell within the normal range.","1352":null,"1353":"Hyponatremia is not uncommon in patients on CAPD, despite the presence of an intraabdominal solution that should preserve normal serum sodium concentration. We have examined the relationship between the plasma renin level and serum sodium concentration in our CAPD patients. Patients with abnormal causes for increased thirst were removed from the study; that is, diabetic patients with fluctuating blood sugar or patients on tricyclic antidepressants or clonidine. In forty-one patients a statistically significant inverse correlation between serum sodium and plasma renin levels was demonstrated. We conclude that thirst stimulation by the renin-angiotensin system contributes to the hyponatremia seen in many patients on CAPD.","1354":"In general, the permeability characteristics of the peritoneal membrane are well maintained with time in the context of current technique survival rates. Some data would suggest that there is a tendency toward hyperpermeability in long-term PD patients; in a much smaller group of patients this may manifest itself as a loss in ultrafiltration capacity in the short term, that is within 2-4 years after CAPD initiation. A reduction in factors, which continue to have a significant negative effect upon technique survival, such as peritonitis and catheter-related infection will see patients remaining on the therapy for longer. This may place a sharper focus on ultrafiltration loss in the PD population, particularly that associated with increases in the permeability of the peritoneum. However, until such time as significant improvements occur it is likely the peritoneal membrane will continue to be more durable than the therapy in the vast majority of patients. It is now becoming clearer that the rate of decline of residual renal function (RRF) may be an important factor in the development of sequelae associated with inadequate dialysis. The role of RRF has often been overlooked when the clinical manifestations of inadequate UF and solute removal have become apparent and further study is required to determine the contribution of residual diuresis to the table of prognostic factors associated with long-term stability of the PD patient. Nevertheless, it is clearly an important parameter worthy of considerable future focus. Although membrane performance appears well maintained in general, routine monitoring of the mass transfer performance of the peritoneum should be performed. Assessment will facilitate focussed dialytic management and allow the clinician to recognise and pre-empt potential problems resulting from inadequate dialysis associated with decreasing or increasing membrane permeability in the small number of patients so affected: such monitoring should include measurement of the mass transfer coefficient at onset and every 6-12 months thereafter. However, the monitoring of RRF and overall solute clearance is perhaps of more significance in view of the contribution of RRF to overall dialytic prescription. The routine assessment of these parameters is also encouraged.","1355":"Adequacy of dialysis is a primary concern when caring for patients undergoing continuous peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). To determine objectively the efficacy of CAPD, the use of an 'efficacy number' (EN) calculated from the data obtained in a peritoneal equilibration test (PET) for creatinine (cr) is proposed: EN = [cr(D\/P) x V24] divided by ACPPD3 Where, cr(D\/P) is PET-derived dialysate\/plasma ratio for creatinine at 4 hrs; V24 is the volume of exchanges (L) prescribed for 24 hrs; ACPPD is adjusted creatinine production based on daily dialysate creatinine appearance. PET were performed and the EN calculated in two groups of CAPD patients observed over a 10 month period. One group (n = 8) had a poor clinical outcome in terms of uremic parameters. The EN in this group was 3.85 +\/- 0.45 (+\/- 1 SD) L\/g creatinine\/day. The other group (n = 4) was considered well dialyzed and had a good clinical outcome over 10 months. The EN in this group was 6.07 +\/- 0.40 L\/g creatine\/day, p less than 0.001. There was no statistically significant difference between the two groups in regard to sex, age, length of time on dialysis, underlying kidney disease, baseline creatinine, or D\/P ratios of creatinine and BUN. The 'efficacy numbers' appears to be more useful than the D\/P ratio alone in determining the adequacy of CAPD. A simple to use nomogram is presented which provides guidelines for the clinician to alter the dialysis prescription.","1356":"There is debate as to how much acetate in PD solutions influences the nUFV, so we decided to evaluate it during uncomplicated IPD and aseptic peritonitis connected with IPD treatment. In 8 patients dialysed with acetate (35 mmol\/L) solutions for 9 +\/- 8 months the nUFV (drainage volume minus instillation volume, mL\/exchange) was calculated for 1.5 and 4.25% glucose exchanges during uncomplicated IPD and aseptic peritonitis. Then, lactate (35 mmol\/L) buffered solutions were used instead of acetate ones and the nUFV was estimated under the same conditions. During uncomplicated IPD as well as peritonitis the nUFV was significantly higher in exchanges with lactate then with acetate solutions when the glucose concentration were comparable. In aseptic peritonitis the nUFV was less decreased with lactate than acetate solutions. We conclude during uncomplicated IPD or aseptic peritonitis in patients dialysed with acetate buffer the nUFV can be improved when acetate in PD solutions is substituted by lactate.","1357":"Fast Pet test is a modified version of original PET. Only one dialysate sample for glucose and creatinine is taken from the total drained dialysate and a blood sample at the end of the test exchange. It can be used both for diagnostic and prognostic purposes. The Pet and clearance measurements are complementary studies which can guide in dialysis prescription.","1358":"The present study, along with some recent studies, suggests that there is an organic link between the amount of dialysis a patient receives and his\/her nutritional status. The latter, as reflected by serum albumin, is predictive of survival on CAPD. It is clear, therefore, that urea kinetic analysis is a powerful tool for prescribing and monitoring therapy in CAPD patients.","1359":"","1360":"The purpose of this paper is to explore the validity of applying urea kinetic indices to CAPD. According to the peak concentration hypothesis, the values of Kt\/V required for adequate dialysis are lower for CAPD than for hemodialysis because of the continuous steady state nature of CAPD. Pilot clinical studies were undertaken in 19 patients to correlate the (Kt\/V)urea index with clinical assessment of adequacy based on a 12 parameter score. The data shows that the correlation between serum urea nitrogen (Kt\/V)urea and protein catabolic rate (PCR) are in keeping with the theoretical predictions of the urea kinetic model. PCR and dietary protein are well correlated. Also, PCR and Kt\/V had a high degree of positive correlation. Serum creatinine was inversely correlated with (Kt\/V)creatinine. In 74% of the patients, the clinical assessment of adequacy was in agreement with the (Kt\/V)urea domains of adequacy established from the peak concentration hypothesis and the urea kinetic model. The lack of correlation in the remaining 26% is being investigated.","1361":"In case of CAPD catheter trouble, we applied a new diagnostic approach using industrial fiberoptics. This method was safe and useful to specify the causes of the catheter trouble.","1362":"A moist heat technique for disinfecting the inner lumen of commercially available connectology used in the exchange process for Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis (CAPD) was evaluated. Moist heat was generated by a device (PDM-1) that directed microwave energy to heat a sample solution containing a concentration of 10(6) microorganisms inside a pair of mated plastic CAPD connectors. Microorganisms tested included those most prevalent and most problematic in causing peritonitis. Testing, performed according to F.D.A. approved standards, involved heating a sample solution and then placing the sample solution into vials which were then sealed and incubated. Absolute determination of growth versus no growth was measured by macroscopic observation. Positive control samples were performed in the same manner but were not exposed to heat. Negative controls were performed in the same manner in the absence of test organisms. At temperatures of approximately 100 degrees C a D-value of 6.6 seconds was determined using the organism found the most thermoresistant. A cycle time of 54 seconds appeared sufficient to achieve a 10(6) population reduction of all microorganisms tested. The moist heat technique offers a safe, effective method for disinfection of the inner lumen of CAPD connectors.","1363":"Dialysate outflow obstruction caused by displacement of the catheter tip is a relatively common complication of peritoneal dialysis, occurring in up to 20% of implanted catheters and often requiring surgical intervention. We describe a simple method used to reposition straight, Tenckhoff-type catheters. The procedure is performed under fluoroscopic control using a 2 mm thick catheter guide, bent fo form a slight curve. The catheter guide is introduced near the tip of the migrated catheter and then rotated in order to bring the catheter to the pelvis. Experiences over the five-year period 84-89 are summarized. In more than 60% of the patients, the first displacement occurred within one month of insertion of the catheter, and 70% of the catheters migrated to the right. The procedure was used in 21 patients to treat 50 displacements. In 86% of the cases the procedure was successful. 52% of the patients needed only one reposition while 48% experienced two or more displacements and subsequent repositions. Five patients eventually needed replacement of the catheter or were permanently switched to hemodialysis. The reposition procedure was practically free of complications.","1364":"To define the type of reaction around the deep cuff of Tenckhoff catheters and possible implications in peritonitis development, a histological evaluation of the tissue reaction around and into the deep cuff was done. Eight catheters, functioning for 2 to 40 months and removed for various reasons were studied. In all cases foreign body granulomata and fibrosis were found, with prominent giant cell formation. An inert birefrigent material, probably dacron particles, was found surrounded by giant cells in fibrotic regions and in some cases appearing as cytoplasmic inclusions. In 6 cases an inflammatory infiltration was observed, while in 4 with relapsing peritonitis, polymorphonuclears and microabscesses were also found. It can be suggested that the tissue reaction to deep cuff predisposes to local infections and might be a factor for relapsing peritonitis.","1365":"To prevent skin-exit infection, an important CAPD complication, we developed a transcutaneous connector made of Alumina ceramic. The new connector could be downsized, because an Alumina ceramic is characteristically bio-inert, rigid and non-porous. Our animal experiments with Alumina ceramic in soft tissue demonstrated the outstanding bio-compatibility of this material. The shape of the new transcutaneous connector was of simple cylindrical configuration so as to inhibit macrostress beneath the skin. To make contact with this connector in the body, a silicon tube was made into a Swan-necked catheter with a disk-shaped polyester cuff, which was positioned subcutaneously beneath the transcutaneous connector in order to reinforce adhesion to soft tissue. The silicon tube itself was L-shaped in its outside portion just before reaching the connector. We are now using this new transcutaneous connector made of Alumina ceramic on a CAPD catheter in 8 patients. In the longest case of a patient using it, there has been no skin-exit infection for 12 months. Also, there has been virtually no downgrowth phenomenon in the skin around the connector, and the connector and tissue have remained in very close contact, although fibrous connective tissue has been seen to form in the area.","1366":"Most centers change the transfer set each time a patient develops peritonitis. The underlying rationale is that development of intraluminal biofilm may favor the adherence of microorganisms to the transfer set and reinfect the patient. The purpose of this study was to assess the necessity of a line change with each episode of peritonitis. We examined 63 consecutive episodes of peritonitis which occurred over a period of 58 months in 23 of our CAPD patients. Each patient performed 3 to 4 exchanges per day. Two patients used the Abbott sterile connection device, the remainder used a Baxter system. In 33 of these episodes a line change was performed (group A) and in 30 it was not (group B). The follow-up period after each episode of peritonitis was 4 weeks. There were 3 episodes of relapsing peritonitis (same organism within 4 weeks of termination of antibiotic treatment) at 3 weeks after finishing intraperitoneal antibiotic therapy in group A and no episodes of relapsing peritonitis in group B. In conclusion, according to our data it appears that a line change may not always be necessary for the adequate management of peritonitis in CAPD patients.","1367":"A protocol of patient selection and more frequent home visits have significantly reduced peritonitis episodes in CAPD patients using Y-set with Amuchina. However, no change in dropout rates were observed.","1368":"Presented in February 1989 from this program was data that reflected our departure from the then recommended procedure of Drain\/Flush\/Fill sequencing with the Delmed Freedom Set. Our procedure was changed to the now accepted Flush\/Drain\/Fill sequencing in this Y-configured, manual disconnect system. The improvement in the incidence of peritonitis was reflected in the data that demonstrated 1 episode of peritonitis (EOP)\/12.4 patient months with the Drain\/Flush\/Fill (D\/F\/F) sequencing and the improved incidence of 1 EOP\/30.4 patient months Flush\/Drain\/Fill (F\/D\/F). Presented here is the cumulative data with an additional 144 patient months experience with the F\/D\/F sequencing of the Delmed Freedom Set and its Safelock connectology. The incidence of peritonitis remains relatively low, and not significantly different from that initial 1 year data, being 1 EOP\/29.6 patient months (current) vs. 1 EOP\/30.4 patient months (1 year data).","1369":"","1370":"Though excessive peritonitis is reported as the cause of 27% of CAPD dropout, over a five-year period, only 5 of 41 patients (12%) who had 5 or more episodes of peritonitis stopped CAPD because of excessive peritonitis. Their average time on CAPD prior to stopping was significantly longer than other dropouts with less peritonitis. Only one patient technically could not continue PD. We conclude that excessive peritonitis need not be a major cause for CAPD dropout.","1371":"Fifty-six S. aureus episodes of catheter exit-site tunnel infections were diagnosed in 40 out of 163 patients treated by CAPD for 30 +\/- 22 months, with standard double-cuff Tenckhoff catheters. The rate of infection was 1 episode every 29 patient\/months. Local care and antibiotic therapy were effective in 52% of the cases. Whereas in 29 episodes in which the medical therapy failed to eradicate the infection the entire area of granulation tissue and cellulitis was excised then the outer dacron cuff was shaved from the silicone catheter. With this treatment 13 episodes (48%) were cured while, in the remaining 14 patients the catheters were removed because of peritonitis in 10; and for failure to eradicate the infection in 4.","1372":"The overall exchange characteristics of the peritoneal 'membrane' are similar to those of continuous microvascular walls in general. The capillary walls in the peritoneum appear to be the principal structures determining the blood-peritoneal exchange.","1373":"Peritonitis is still a major problem in CAPD. The synthetic chemotherapeutic quinolone ciprofloxacin offers new possibilities for oral treatment of this complication. The efficacy of ciprofloxacin as first-line antibiotic was investigated in five consecutive peritonitis episodes of five patients. The dosage was deduced from a pilot study and consisted of an intra-peritoneal loading dose during the first 24 hours. Simultaneously ciprofloxacin was given orally and thereafter only the oral medication was continued. The causative microorganisms in the 5 episodes were (MIC90 in brackets): nonfermentative Gram negative rod, group IVc-2 (0.6 micrograms\/ml), S. aureus (0.25 micrograms ml), Strep. faecalis (0.4 micrograms\/ml), S. aureus + S. epidermidis (both 0.25 micrograms\/ml) and S. aureus (0.13 micrograms\/ml). The clinical course was uncomplicated and all episodes were cured with ciprofloxacin monotherapy. In 4 patients all dialysate concentrations exceeded 2.3 micrograms\/ml (mean 5.8 micrograms\/ml). In one patient dialysate concentrations varied between 2.2 and 7.5 micrograms\/ml during the first 24 hrs and between 0.4 and 1.2 micrograms\/ml thereafter. Despite these low dialysate concentrations, the episode caused by S. aureus (MIC90 0.25 micrograms\/ml) was cured uneventfully. We conclude that ciprofloxacin may be useful for the treatment of CAPD peritonitis. Large interindividual differences in dialysate concentrations should be taken into account.","1374":"From October 1985 to August 1989, 55 episodes of peritonitis were treated with intraperitoneal (i.p.) use of Vancomycin (V) and Tobramycin (T), in 35 patients (18 males, 17 females). After three rapid IL peritoneal exchanges, the pts received i.p. loading dose of V500 mg\/L and an intramuscular dose of T 1.7 mg\/Kg, followed by four IL exchanges, with addition of V15 mg\/L and T8 mg\/L. The length of treatment was 10 days for all pts. The continued administration of V or T as the simple antibiotic regimen was based on the antibiogram, while the combination of both antibiotics was used in negative cultures. Recurrence of peritonitis was seen in 3 episodes (5.4%). No side effects were seen during the therapy. These results indicate that the i.p. use of Vancomycin plus Tobramycin are an appropriate antiperitonitis regimen in the treatment of CAPD peritonitis.","1375":"The in vitro release of interleukin-1 beta (IL-1 beta) by peritoneal macrophages from CAPD patients was studied during 16 infection free periods (16 patients) and 13 episodes of peritonitis (10 patients) using an ELISA. Without exogeneous stimulation with LPS, peritoneal macrophages released the same amounts of IL-1 beta. irrespective if they were obtained during an infection free period (473 +\/- 92 pg\/ml 24h, means +\/- SEM) or during peritonitis (324 +\/- 125 pg\/ml). However, in response to a dose of 5 micrograms\/ml of LPS, peritoneal macrophages released significantly more (p less than 0.005) IL-1 beta during peritonitis (6155 +\/- 1743 pg\/ml). These findings show that during peritonitis, peritoneal macrophages are primed in vivo to release more IL-1 beta in vitro after stimulation with LPS, indicating that activation of peritoneal macrophages for IL-1 beta secretion occurs stepwise.","1376":"Continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis, peritoneal macrophage, IL-1, IFN-r, TNF, phagocytosis. Peritoneal macrophages (PM) perform first-line defense activity against peritonitis, the most important complication in CAPD therapy. Our longitudinal study compared the PM function in 14 patients in a low peritonitis occurrence group (LPOG) and 6 in a high peritonitis occurrence group (HPOG) before and during peritonitis; all started CAPD therapy after January 1988. The results show that at the onset of peritonitis, PM function including bactericidal killing (BA) activity, phagocytosis index (PI), H2O2 release, interleukin-1 (IL-1) and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) secretion can increase rapidly in the LPOG. However, this was absent in the HPOG. Both groups had a decrease of PM immunological function in the initial 7 to 10 days after onset of peritonitis, then PM functions began to return toward their pre-peritonitis state. However, in the HPOG, the recovery of PM function was very slow, resulting in significantly lower PM functions. In vitro, when normal PM were put into peritonitis dialysate, IL-1, TNF production and PI, BA activity of PM were decreased. This suppressor activity was absent in the peritonitis-free dialysate. These results suggest a suppressor factor(s) in the HPOG peritoneal dialysate may decrease the function of PM rather than cause easy peritonitis development.","1377":"Our previous in vitro studies have shown that Ca++ and 1,25(OH)2D3 modulate peritoneal macrophage (PMO) antimicrobial activity in CAPD patients. We thus evaluated in vivo in 24 CAPD patients (12 who had never had peritonitis and 12 with an overall peritonitis incidence of more than one episode per 8 patient\/month), the effects of different peritoneal dialysis fluid (PDF) Ca++ concentrations (1.25, 1.75 and 2.25 mmol\/L) on PMO: 1. cytoplasmic Ca++ concentration; 2. superoxide generation; 3. Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) release; 4. bacterial killing for staphylococcus epidermidis. The same parameters were also evaluated after adding 1,25(OH)2D3 (0.25 microgram\/L) to the PDF. Results showed a direct correlation between the PDF Ca++ concentration and PMO Ca++ levels, superoxide and LTB4 generation, and bacterial killing, such that with 2.25 mmol\/L of Ca++ these values were significantly higher than those seen with 1.75 mmol\/L. The addition of 1,25(OH)2D3 potentiated the Ca++ - induced effects. On the contrary, with PDF Ca++ levels of 1.25 mmol\/L, an inhibition of the aforementioned parameters was seen. However, this effect was reversed by the addition of 1,25(OH)2D3. These in vivo results confirm the importance of Ca++ and 1,25(OH)2D3 in PMO antibacterial functions in CAPD patients and may be useful in the prophylaxis and therapy of peritonitis.","1378":"To evaluate the role of bacterial peritonitis in peritoneal macrophage (PMO) Beta-2 Microglobulin (B2M) production and its relationship with PMO Interleukin-1 (IL-1) and Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) release we analyzed in 20 CAPD patients (10 with peritonitis): 1. in vivo plasma and peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE) B2M, IL-1 and LTB4 levels; 2. in vitro B2M, IL-1 and LTB4 release by PMO. Values were compared with those seen in the plasma or with peripheral blood monocytes of 30 hemodialysis (HD) patients (10 treated with Cuprophan-CU-, 10 with Polyacrylonitrile - PAN, and 10 with Cellulose Acetate - CA). Results showed that in CAPD patients with bacterial peritonitis B2M, IL-1 and LTB4 concentrations in the PDE were significantly higher than those seen in CAPD patients without peritonitis or in the plasma of HD patients treated with PAN or CA, but were similar to those seen in HD patients treated with CU. At the same time, in vitro, PMO from CAPD patients with bacterial peritonitis produced more B2M, IL-1 and LTB4 than did PMO from CAPD patients without peritonitis or peripheral blood monocytes from HD patients treated with PAN or CA. We conclude that in CAPD patients bacterial peritonitis is able to induce PMO B2M production, probably via a cytokine-mediated process, which may be analogous to what occurs with peripheral blood monocytes of HD patients treated with CU.","1379":"In vitro, some studies revealed the importance of the CA++ level in peritoneal macrophage functions in CAPD patients. We therefore retrospectively studied the relationship between the frequency of peritonitis and the concentration of Ca, Ca++, Interferon-r (IFN-gamma), Interleukin-1B (IL-1B) in the Pd effluent. Samples were taken during a peritonitis-free period. In a group of patients without peritonitis, the mean Ca++ level in the Pd effluent was 2.25 +\/- 0.20 mEq\/L, while in the other group with frequent episodes of peritonitis (more than one episode per 20 patient-months), the mean Ca++ level in PD effluent was 2.01 +\/- 0.13 mEq\/L which was significantly lower than the former (p less than 0.05). The mean Ca concentration in Pd effluent was also lower in the group with the high frequent peritonitis than the peritonitis-free group, but not significantly. The level of IFN-gamma is lower and IL-1B is higher in the group with frequent peritonitis than in the peritonitis-free group, although these differences were not significant. These evidences suggest that lower Ca++ level in the effluent of the frequent peritonitis group may impair the peritoneal macrophage function and peritoneal cell-mediated immune function and may increase a risk of the peritonitis. These results may offer a new approach for prophylaxis of peritonitis in CAPD patients.","1380":"","1381":"","1382":"Urinary 5-OH-Indoloacetic acid (5-HIAA) indicates the turnover of almost all circulating serotonin (5-HT), a potent vasoactive agent. We tried to investigate the possible excretion of 5-HIAA in the dialysate of CAPD patients and its possible effects on blood pressure control (BP) and\/or ultrafiltration (UF). The 24 h excretion of 5-HIAA in the urine of 10 patients with chronic renal failure (CRF) and 8 healthy persons (CONTROL), and in the dialysate of 15 patients on CAPD was measured by FPIA. In CRF 5-HIAA excretion was less than that in control (p less than 0.01). In CAPD patients two distinct patterns of 5-HIAA excretion were found. Patients with high excretion (greater than 6 mg) had high BP and low UF, while those with low excretion (less than 3.14) had low BP, high UF and frequent hypotensive episodes. Excretion of 5-HIAA in the dialysate had a negative correlation with UF (r = -0.779, p less than 0.001) and a positive correlation with B.P. (r = 0.487, n.s.). A highly significant (p less than 0.01) correlation between BP and UF was also found. As no differences between the two groups in factors that could affect UF or BP were found, the implication that 5-HT affects ultrafiltration and\/or BP regulation is suggested.","1383":"Catheter obstruction due to fibrin deposits during CAPD can cause poor outflow of peritoneal fluid and recurrent peritonitis. In order to treat this complication, 75,000 IU of diluted Urokinase (UK) were infused into catheters obstructed by fibrin in 10 CAPD patients (4 of which had peritonitis), without adverse reactions. After 60 minutes, a 2 liter exchange of peritoneal fluid was performed. In all the cases a normal outflow was restored. Hemostasis parameters (PT, PTT, TT, Fibrinogen, FDP, Fibrin monomers, BT, AT III) and blood cells count (RBC, HGB, HCT, WBC, PTL), were assayed before and two hours after the UK infusion, and did not show any significant variation, except for a decrease of white blood cells, which remained, however, within the normal range. No peritonitis episode occurred in the follow-up period. UK fibrinolytic therapy is safe and effective in treating fibrin obstruction of CAPD catheters without catheter removal and prevents recurrent peritonitis.","1384":"We considered the hypothesis that CAPD is a superior treatment to HD in patients with dialysis-refractory hypertension. We compared 12 HD patients to 22 CAPD patients entered to our program over a one year period. All had been treated for hypertension before dialysis. We found that systolic blood pressure decreased in CAPD patients compared to HD patients, even though medications were more commonly reduced in CAPD patients compared to HD patients. Ten CAPD patients required no medications after one year's treatment. These preliminary data in this small pilot study support the notion that CAPD is superior to HD in blood pressure management of hypertensive patients. A large, multicenter study may be warranted to determine if CAPD favorably influences the risk of cardiovascular complications in dialysis patients compared to HD.","1385":"A 41-year-old CAPD patient developed Grey-Turner's sign during the course of bacterial peritonitis due to Pseudomonas aeruginosa. At the same time a diagnosis of sclerosing peritonitis was made by CT-scanning of the abdomen. We think that Grey-Turner's flank staining could either have been caused by synthesis of proteases by the Pseudomonas bacteria or by reduced mesenteric flexibility and increased vascularization of the peritoneum due to the sclerosing peritonitis. This could have led to spontaneous mesenteric bleeding with leakage to the retroperitoneal tissues. A possible relationship with an ascites puncture is less likely.","1386":"We have experienced a high incidence of indirect inguinal hernias occurring in the first few months of starting CAPD in male patients with autosomal dominant polycystic kidney disease (PKD). Out of 13 patients with P.C.K. on CAPD one (7.7%) had inguinal herniorraphy at an early age and six (46.2%) developed bilateral indirect inguinal hernia during CAPD. In comparison only one of 30 other male patients on CAPD developed indirect inguinal hernia and none had any evidence of previous inguinal herniorrhaphy or of indirect inguinal hernia on clinical examination. Five out of seventeen (29.4%) male patients with P.C.K. on hemodialysis or conservative treatment of renal impairment had history of inguinal herniorrhaphy or an evidence of inguinal hernia on clinical examination. This compares with a rate of herniorrhaphy performed for indirect inguinal hernia approximately 1.5 per 1000 population. In one patient on CAPD a peritoneogram using 99m Tc sulfur colloid suggested a patent processes vaginalis to account for scrotal edema on one side; the patient subsequently developed an indirect inguinal hernia on the other side just a few months after the repair. In view of high association of patent processus vaginalis with P.C.K. we recommend it is routinely searched in this group of patients and repaired at time of CAPD catheter insertion.","1387":"Development of massive hydrothorax is well known in CAPD patients. Five CAPD patients at one center have developed some form of pleuroperitoneal communication as evidenced by pleural effusion. Temporary discontinuation of CAPD, tetracycline instillation, and surgical patch grafting of the diaphragm have been used as treatments for the communication.","1388":"In order to evaluate the effect of Calcium Antagonists on the permeability of the peritoneal membrane in patients on CAPD, the peritoneal clearances, the mass transfer, the ultrafiltration and the mass transfer area coefficient (MTAC) were measured. We studied 10 patients before and after the instillation of 10 mg (5 mg\/L) of Verapamil into the peritoneal cavity. Our results showed a significant (p less than 0.05) increase of urea, creatinine and uric acid clearances. A significant increase (p less than 0.05) in the ultrafiltration and MTAC was also observed, while the mass transfer of electrolytes K+, Na+ and Ca++ was unchanged. These findings indicate that the intraperitoneal use of verapamil may induce an increase in the peritoneal permeability in patients on CAPD.","1389":"Several isolated problems, which in magnitude may appear small, yet can be enormous management problems, are discussed. In most instances experience is limited and literature is sparse. An attempt has been made to collate personal experience with that from the literature in arriving at guidelines for management of these problems.","1390":"Comparisons of peritoneal clearances, hematologic and biochemical assays were performed on eleven CAPD patients using 2 liter and 2.5 liter daily exchanges. Group 1 consisted of 8 patients substituting all four daily 2 liter exchanges. These patients experienced statistically significant increases in urea and creatinine clearance (an average of 15% and 10% respectively). Corresponding reductions in serum levels occurred (8% and 9% respectively). Ultrafiltrate volume increased by an average of 12%. Group II consisted of 3 patients that substituted one 2 liter exchange. These patients also experienced increases in urea and creatinine clearance (8% and 11% respectively) and decreases in corresponding serum levels (1% and 4% respectively). Ultrafiltrate volume increased an average of 12%. After one month on the 2.5 liter regimen, patients were surveyed for their reactions to larger exchange volumes. Ninety-one percent of patients decided to continue using the 2.5 liter volume. Reasons cited included feeling better and having better weight and fluid control. None of the patients demonstrated complications such as catheter leakage or hernias. The use of four daily 2.5 liter exchanges can provide over 20% more clearance for many CAPD patients currently using 2 liter exchanges. This survey demonstrates most patients tolerate 2.5 liters, and they feel better. A 2.5 liter regimen may be indicated for patients who could benefit from more dialysis and for those at risk of dropping out of CAPD due to inadequate dialysis.","1391":"Among 63 patients (pts) on HPD 26 (41.7%) had need of a partner (PN) in conducting dialysis. In most cases the role of a partner is performed by the consort (26.9%) or by a son or daughter (19.3%). Forty-four percent of all partners worked in the home. The PN is significantly higher (P = 0.0001) in pts aged 65 or more. The most frequent cause of PN (38.6%) was a memory and learning deficiency (MLD) of the exact sequence of dialysis maneuvers, in particular in elderly pts. The Talking Cricket (TC), a tape recorder device with a series of automated and safety features, conceived and settled in our center to guide the patient through the dialysis procedures at home, represents a valid alternative choice to the partner in pts with MLD. Seven pts with MLD, aged between 69 and 80 years, used the TC at home with a Y-set with Amuchina. During a follow-up of 84.4 months we observed 3 peritonitis episodes, 4 accidental infusions of disinfectant in to the peritoneal cavity; and 3 pts discontinued the use of the TC. The TC has been used in the hospital to train 5 pts undergoing CAPD: standardization and uniformity of teaching facilitates both learning by the patients and teaching by the nurses.","1392":"Recovery of renal function was observed in 10 out of 300 patients (3.3%) treated by CAPD. These 10 patients presented the following primary renal diseases: 4 nephroangiosclerosis, 4 interstitial nephropathies, 1 diabetic nephropathy, 1 unknown nephropathy, and were treated by CAPD for a mean period of 10.2 +\/- 5.5 months. CAPD was discontinued when residual renal function reached 12 ml\/min. After recovery 8 patients were still alive, including 1 patient who returned to dialysis. 2 patients died. When risk factors such as uncontrolled hypertension, cardiac failure, severe nephrotic syndrome, rapidly progressive renal failure, analgesics or non steroidal anti-inflammatory drug treatments or abuses, chronic urinary obstruction, cholesterol emboli were associated with end stage renal failure, CAPD should be the dialysis treatment of choice, expecting the preservation of the kidney capacities and further a recovery of renal function.","1393":"In this report we evaluate the results obtained with CAPD in uremic patients in Piedmont, a Northern Italian region (4.4 million inhabitants) during the last 7 years. Data are gathered from the computerized records of the regional dialysis and transplantation registry, which collects information on 3,567 pts, 2,243 of which entered since Jan. 1981 and 1,808 alive at Dec. 1987. Among these, 193 (11%) were on CAPD, a figure almost constant in the last 7 years. However CAPD diffusion is not uniform among the 20 centers of the region, ranging from 0 to 49.5% of the patients on dialysis. CAPD is particularly employed in the elderly (47.5% of the patients being older than 60 years and 19.5% over 70). This treatment was the first choice in 16% of the patients admitted to dialysis between 1981-87; this figure reaches 33% for the diabetics. High drop out rates still represent a major problem, in a 6 year follow up 66% of the patients being transferred to another dialysis treatment. Peritonitis is the main cause of drop out (22%), while loss of peritoneal membrane efficiency accounts for 7%, patient's choice 14%, catheter complications 14%, inability to cope 8%, clinical problems 20% and other reasons 15%. Drop out rate is not influenced by the presence of high risk condition or age. Survival curves show no significant difference for CAPD in comparison to hemodialysis in all the age groups considered. This epidemiological survey, based on a global 522 pts experience extended over a 7 year period, indicates that CAPD is a competitive mode of treatment in chronic uremia.","1394":"The purpose of this work is to compare survival and drop-out in 2 groups of patients undergoing either CAPD (42 pts) or standard HD (48 pts) as first treatment, from November 1981 to December 1988. Mean age and number of risk factors were not significantly different. At the end of the study 50.0% of pts on CAPD and 37.5% on HD were still on first treatment; clinical problems were the most frequent cause of drop-out. The total period of observation was significantly higher in the CAPD group (1391.0 months vs 850.4), but the life table analysis showed no significant differences in the incidence of death and of drop-out in the two groups. The follow-up of the CAPD group was subdivided into two periods, due to the fact that a scheme for clinical and social survey of patients undergoing dialysis and a policy of more frequent home visits were introduced at the end of 1985. A significant decrease of peritonitis episodes was observed in the second period.","1395":"We evaluated survival and risk factors in 86 elderly patients (pts) who underwent dialysis at one center throughout the last 10 years. Thirty-five pts received hemodialysis (HD), 32 intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD), and 19 continuous peritoneal dialysis (CAPD). Risk factors included: treatment, age, sex, underlying disease, heart failure (HF), peripheral vascular disease (PVD), diabetes mellitus (DM) and malignancy. Median age was 65 years for both HD and CAPD, and 69 for IPD (p less than 0.05). Survival evaluation demonstrated a longer life span for HD vs. IPD (p = 0.02) for CAPD vs. IPD (p = 0.03) and no difference between HD and CAPD pts. Cox analysis showed higher death odds ratio (OR = 2.4) for IPD vs. HD and lower ratio for CAPD vs. IPD (OR = 0.3). Other OR positive risk factors were: HF, PVD, DM and malignancy. The median value of risk factors for each group was higher for both IPD and CAPD vs. HD. Both life span and death OR for CAPD were equal to HD in spite of higher risk factors in CAPD group. The lower survival of the IPD group may be due to its older age. CAPD should represent the elective treatment for elderly uremics while HD or IPD should be reserved for selected patients.","1396":"The present study was conducted to see whether the exercise capacity can be altered by intraperitoneal dialysis solution in patients on CAPD. Symptom-limited progressive treadmill tests with respiratory gas analysis were performed in patients on long-term CAPD, and exercise time (ET), maximal oxygen uptake (VO2 max) and ventilatory anaeorbic threshold (AT) were obtained. The treadmill tests were carried out before and after the drainage of 2-liters of dialysis solution. The dialysate bag with the fluid had either been carried by patients on their backs (test A) or been kept apart from their bodies (test B) during exercise, i.e. an apparent body weight in test B without the CAPD bag decreased by 2 kg as compared with the control. VO2max, AT or ET in test A did not change, whereas ET in the test B was prolonged after the drainage of dialysis solution (before: 437 +\/- 170 sec, after: 479 +\/- 158 sec, n = 10, p less than .01). No change was noted in VO2max or AT in test B. We conclude that the dialysis solution retained in the peritoneal cavity affects ET by acting as an extra-weight, although the solution has no influence on VO2max and AT.","1397":"The aim of this study is to evaluate cardiac output (CO) with CO2 rebreathing method (RCO2) in patients (pts) on CAPD. We have studied 15 pts on CAPD from at least 6 months, the mean (+\/- SD) age was 55 +\/- 4 years, mean (+\/- SD) hemoglobin was 10 +\/- 2 gr\/dl. The respiratory tests excluded obstructive or restrictive broncopneumopathies. Electrocardiograms and B-mode echocardiograms were normal. RCO2 was evaluated using the FICK formula: CO = VCO2\/CvCO2 - CaCO2 where VCO2 is CO2 production; CvCO2 is the CO2 content in venous mixed blood; CACO2 is arterial CO2. VCO2 was obtained by collecting expired air into a Douglas bag during respiration at rest for 4 minutes. CvCO2 was obtained after 10-15 seconds of respiration in a mixture of 7% CO2 in O2. CaCO2 was obtained at CO2 end-tidal capnogram. RCO2 was performed in CAPD with full and empty abdomen. The mean (+\/- SD) CO was 2.3 +\/- 1.04 l\/min with both full and empty abdomen, values below those theoretically calculated, taking into account the age and body surface (4.7 +\/- 0.6 l\/min P less than 0.0005). The reduction of CO is not induced by left ventricular insufficiency, but such phenomenon could be attributed to a redistribution of body fluid between intra and extracellular, in favour of the intracellular compartment. Therefore the increase in hematocrit and total plasma proteins can be fictitious.","1398":"In order to establish a relationship between upper GI symptoms and CAPD therapy, 34 CAPD patients underwent UGI endoscopy and X-ray studies. Endoscopy is more specific than upper GI X-ray series in the diagnosis of gastrointestinal lesions.","1399":"The magnitude of peritoneal solute clearance is analyzed in terms of: 1) population mean, 2) preservation during long-term therapy, 3) values obtained with hemodialysis, and 4) requirements to maintain patients free of uremic signs and symptoms. The peritoneal equilibration test (PET) has been used successfully to characterize peritoneal solute transport rates and to formulate more adequate dialysis prescription. Serial PET's can also provide a valuable prognostic index of peritoneal membrane function. The experience with mechanical and physical maneuvers to enhance peritoneal clearance is reviewed.","1400":"Peritoneal equilibration tests (PET's) are a simple means of monitoring peritoneal membrane function in C.A.P.D. patients. Findings on initial testing have been proposed as having prognostic value for a patient's course on peritoneal dialysis. 177 serial P.E.T.'s were performed in 49 patients at six monthly intervals using a 2 litre 4.25% dextrose exchange and a four hour dwell and equilibration ratios were calculated for urea (D\/P U), creatinine (D\/P C) and glucose (D\/Do G). Alterations in equilibration ratios with time were not significant in the group as a whole. However, a subgroup of 12 patients was identified in whom there were significant increases in D\/P U (p .02) and in D\/P C (p .003) and decreases in D\/Do G (p .025) between zero and 18 months. A subgroup of five patients in whom D\/P U decreased significantly (p .05) was also identified. These subgroups did not differ significantly in clinical characteristics although peritonitis was more frequent in the group with increasing transport. As results of P.E.T.'s alter with time in many patients prognostication based on initial values only may not be valid.","1401":"Peritoneal membrane suffers in some CAPD patients changes which modify its functionalism. In order to know whether these changes could be expected or appropriate, it is necessary to explore the general and particular conditions which can alter peritoneal physiology. Three aspects, smoking, intraabdominal hyperpressure and and omentectomy are situations which have not been included in the studies of peritoneal physiology. The control group was constituted by 23 patients. Diabetics were studied as a separate group, with their own 10 patient controls. Smokers (1-20 cigarettes per day): 15 were non-diabetic patients, 9 were females. Diabetic smokers: 7 patients. Intraabdominal hyperpressure was determined by two big polycycstic kidneys (PCKD) in 8 patients, none diabetic. Omentectomy was performed in 6 non-diabetic and 9 diabetic patients. In all cases the procedure was prescribed because of an early catheter entrapment. Smoker patients show significant higher MTCs values for urea and creatinine than controls, but the slightly lower ultrafiltration value did not reached significant difference. Polycystic kidney patients showed lower MTCs values in respect to controls. Ultrafiltration capacity was similar. Omentectomized patients did not show any differences in respect to controls. In the diabetic patients group, neither ultrafiltration nor MTCs values presented significant differences between the established subgroups. So, smoking did not seem to induce higher MTC values as in the non-diabetic group. In conclusion, and according to the present results, two more situations should be taken into account in the evaluation of the peritoneal membrane dialyzing capacities: smoking, which increases diffusion capacity except for diabetics and PCKD with tow big kidneys, which decreases this capacity.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS) ","1402":"Soft tissue complications (STC) involving the catheter tract and exit site continue to be a significant source of morbidity (40%) and cause for catheter removal (8%). Inner cuff infections, accompanied by peritonitis and managed with catheter removal, occurred in 6% of catheters. All other STC can be managed without catheter removal. STC presenting without peritonitis have not been associated with an increase in peritonitis related catheter loss.","1403":"Intraluminal transmission of bacteria remains a significant factor in the morbidity and procedural success of CAPD. A worsening rate of peritonitis in a longstanding CAPD program (first patients 1978) led to a search for a system which might allow a lesser rate of peritonitis. Simplicity in the procedure was a requirement. For this reason disconnect systems were not considered. The Travenol spike system was prospectively compared with Delmed leur lock in terms of rate of peritonitis and difficulty in training. The former had been used by the center since inception of the CAPD program. 28 patients new to CAPD were alternately assigned to each system without other bias, including diagnosis, age, sex, or race. The study, while ongoing, was analyzed at 12 months. 66 patient months were involved with each system. The peritonitis rates were: 2.2 episodes: patient year with the Travenol; 0.9 episode:patient year for the Delmed systems. The Delmed system appears to provide a lower rate of peritonitis. In addition, less manual dexterity, steadiness, and hand eye coordination are necessary.","1404":"The peritonitis rates observed with various peritoneal dialysis techniques and connectors are analyzed based on literature results and a large center experience. It is apparent that techniques sharing an initial dialysate flush following a connection are superior in reducing the rate of peritonitis. Connecting and sterilizing devices may help prevent peritonitis in high risk groups and often facilitate the connecting procedure by serving as patient assist devices.","1405":"The Freedom Set II is designed with a three-way valve to control the direction of dialysate flow thus simplifying the procedure and decreasing training time. Twenty-four patients from two centers were trained on the Freedom Set II and were observed for ninety patient months. Five patients who had been on other bagless systems expressed their preference for the Freedom Set II. The peritonitis rate for the observation period was one episode every 21 patient months. We conclude that the Freedom Set II provides safe, cost-effective dialysis and simplifies the CAPD procedure.","1406":"Use of automated cycler equipment is currently limited to a fraction of the peritoneal dialysis population. Various technical barriers combined in the past to inhibit its wider application. We have treated forty-seven patients over an eight year period with cycler dialysis, and have observed the evolution of this modality from a treatment of last resort to a first choice therapy for many patients--especially those who work.","1407":"Despite theoretical advantages of CCPD, only 1 of 13 patients trained in this modality continue on CCPD in a 3 year review period. Average duration on CCPD was only 7 months. When compared with our CAPD population higher transplant rates, death rates, and dissatisfaction with the dialysis technique, but not higher peritonitis rates were reasons for terminating CCPD.","1408":"The various modalities of automated peritoneal dialysis are discussed with emphasis on advantages and disadvantages, relative efficiency in states of normal and abnormal peritoneal permeability, and patient selection. The importance of residual renal function, peritoneal solute transport, body mass, protein intake and catabolic rate in formulating peritoneal dialysis prescription is reviewed.","1409":"To evaluate B2M removal during CAPD, the equilibration curve was determined in 9 CAPD patients (aged 67.9 +\/- 6.5 years, treated for 19.0 +\/- 17.4 months). The study was carried out on 2 consecutive days using 1.36% (day 1) and 3.86% (day 2) dextrose dialysis solutions for 6 hours each day. The B2M plasma value was the mean of 4 samples taken at the start and after 2, 4 and 6 hours. Dialysate values were determined on 3 ml samples taken every 30 minutes. The curve was fitted for dialysate to plasma B2M ratio (D\/P) versus time to define the B2M equilibration curve. Our results showed that the value had a linear regression with both types of solution in all patients. The D\/P B2M ratio was linear during the 6 hours of dwell time. Furthermore, there was no significant difference between the 2 solutions used. In conclusion, standard CAPD allows a low but constant B2M removal. An increase or a reduction in dwell time do not seem to have any influence on the B2M removal, which could be improved by methods other than varying dwell time and\/or solution osmolarity.","1410":"Plasma atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) and digoxin-like immunoreactive substances (DLIS) levels were assayed in 10 patients on intermittent peritoneal dialysis (IPD) before and after a 12 hour dialysis session. Ultrafiltration volumes and blood pressures, pre and post dialysis were recorded. Left atrial diameter (LAD), as determined by M-mode echocardiography was measured prior to and at the end of each dialysis session. Ten age matched patients on hemodialysis (HD) served as controls. Predialysis plasma ANP was significantly higher in HD as compared to IPD patients and dialysis resulted in a significant decrease of plasma ANP in IPD and HD patients (37.9 +\/- 28.0 to 23.1 +\/- 28.5 and 201.9 +\/- 110.7 to 117.0 +\/- 75.6 pg\/ml, respectively, p less than 0.05). Ultrafiltration volumes in IPD averaged 1840 +\/- 645 ml\/dialysis. The corresponding decrease in body weight in HD was 2000 +\/- 220 g. Total DLIS levels in IPD and HD did not change with dialysis. LAD decrease significantly post dialysis (41.3 +\/- 5.0 to 38.6 +\/- 5.7 cm, p less than 0.001). Calculated ANP clearance during IPD was 5.6 +\/- 3.9 ml\/min. Plasma ANP correlated significantly with ultrafiltration volumes and LAD. It thus appears that ANP is sensitive to volume status in dialysed patients. Its dialysance, in IPD, approaches that of other middle molecules. Under the conditions tested ANP does not influence DLIS levels.","1411":"Twenty-six chronic uremic pts (8F and 18M, mean age 64 yrs) on CAPD for 15 months on the average, were studied as regards the levels of B2M measured by radioimmunoassay in fasting serum samples. Considering residual renal function, 2 pts groups were identified: 11 pts with a diuresis greater than or equal to 500 cc\/day and 15 pts with a diuresis less than 500 cc\/day. Serum B2M was significantly decreased in the first group (24.8 +\/- 8.1 vs 34.7 +\/- 7.1 mg\/l; p less than 0.02). Considering the incidence of peritonitis episodes, 12 pts without and 14 pts with one or more peritonitis episodes were noted. The group with no peritonitis showed significantly decreased serum B2M values (25.1 +\/- 7.6 vs 35.03 +\/- 4.8 mg\/l; p less than 0.005). No relationship was found as regards primary renal diseases, sex and age of pts. We conclude that residual renal function and peritonitis episodes modify serum B2M levels in CAPD. The long term follow up of pts could be of interest for better defining the role of these factors as regards the incidence of pathologic lesions associated with B2M deposition.","1412":"Bicarbonate has been proposed as buffer in CAPD solutions in recent years instead of lactate and acetate. The present study is designed to evaluate peritoneal bicarbonate kinetics using bicarbonate solutions. Seventy kinetic studies have been performed in 7 patients treated with 2 CAPD solutions containing 35 mmol\/l (A) and 27 mmol\/l (B) of bicarbonate. The changes in dialysate bicarbonate concentration at different dwell times were correlated with bicarbonate blood levels. Furthermore after 2 hours of dwell time and at subsequent observations, no differences in dialysate bicarbonate concentration were found between A and B solutions at the same bicarbonatemia. Thus a feedback between bicarbonate absorption and bicarbonate blood concentration was observed. If the amount of bicarbonate transferred to the patient is over the metabolic acid production, bicarbonatemia will rise: consequently bicarbonate dialysate absorption will decrease. After a few days, an equilibrium point will be reached. In this condition the bicarbonate absorption is equal to metabolic acid production and, in stable clinical conditions, a stable acid base status will be maintained by the patient. Our studies empirically demonstrated that the equilibrium is reached when a difference of 5 mmols between blood and inlet dialysate bicarbonate concentration is observed. Consequently to achieve 25 mmol\/l of bicarbonatemia, the bicarbonate concentration of CAPD solution should be about 30 mmol\/l.","1413":"Apolipoprotein Clearance and Atherogenicity in CAPD: Protein and lipoprotein loss is one of the disadvantages of CAPD. The impact of these losses on serum constituents is not fully understood. Lipoprotein disorders are observed in patients with chronic or acute renal failure or undergoing dialytic therapy with resultant increase in atherosclerotic clinical events yet these phenomenon are poorly understood, underinvestigated and underreported. Thus the impact of dietary and pharmacological steps to prevent these events are limited by lack of clinical facts. The recent emergence of effective lipid lowering agents makes a rapid analysis of parameters important. We studied the relationships between peritoneal clearance of apolipoproteins and serum atherogenicity indicators in a preliminary study of 10 CAPD patients with and without peritonitis. We measured total cholesterol (TC), HDL-Cholesterol (HDL-C), Apo A-I and Apo B and dialysate levels of Apo A-I and Apo B. Apo levels were determined immunotubidimetrically, and dialysate was concentrated by ultrafiltration. A subsequent prospective group of 10 additional patients was studied to test the relationship found in the preliminary study. In both preliminary and prospective nonperitonitis groups, the ratio of peritoneal clearance of Apo A-I to Apo B correlated strongly with the serum TC\/HDL-C (r = 0.9 preliminary, r = 0.78 prospective group). There was an inverse correlation between the clearance ratio and both serum HDL-C (r = -0.71 preliminary, r = -0.77 prospective group) and serum Apo A-I\/Apo B (r = -0.74 preliminary, r = -0.62 prospective group).(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1414":"CAPD has been considered an appropriate method for treatment of diabetics in renal failure. Up to now the choice of route for insulin administration in these patients has not been definitely defined, although there is a general consensus for employing the intraperitoneal route for this purpose. However, contradictory data have appeared on this subject. Our aim has been to investigate whether the subcutaneous or intraperitoneal route makes any difference to metabolic control, and if so what is the price in terms of the incidence of peritonitis. Two groups of diabetic patients from three different hospitals with a similar peritonitis incidence and training protocols were studied. Of the 30 patients, 15 were treated with subcutaneous insulin (sc group) and in the other 15 the intraperitoneal route was employed (ip. group). The average follow-up period was 20.8 +\/- 7.5 months for sc group and 18.7 +\/- 8 months for ip. group. Insulin requirements were 30 +\/- 11 u.\/day in the sc. and 110 +\/- 60 u\/day in the i.p. group (p less than 0.05) and remained constant during the study period. Metabolic controls (home glucose levels, HbA1C, hospital fasting glucose levels) were similar for both groups. However, the incidence of peritonitis was 4 times greater in the ip. group. In the ip. group 18 peritonitis episodes were registered in 280 patient-months vs 5 episodes in sc. group in 312 patient-months. We conclude that the intraperitoneal route for insulin administration in diabetic CAPD patients produces a higher risk of suffering peritonitis with no real metabolic improvement in the medium term.","1415":"Repeated episodes of peritonitis cause malnutrition in CAPD patients because of increased protein loss into the dialysate, a high protein catabolic rate (PCR), and\/or a decrease in appetite. The purpose of this study was to investigate whether protein supplements could improve the nutritional status of CAPD patients and secondarily reduce their incidence of peritonitis. Eight patients on CAPD were studied for 2 months as a baseline, then given protein supplementation for 4 months. There was significant (p less than .05) increase in dietary intake and nitrogen balance, with supplementation. The PCR decreased significantly (p less than .05). There was a concomitant decrease in the incidence of new episodes of peritonitis. In conclusion, protein supplementation can improve the catabolic state of CAPD patients.","1416":"Thirteen patients treated with CAPD, 22 patients maintained on hemodialysis (HD) using aluminium-free water and matched for duration of treatment and 15 conservatively treated uremic patients (CONS) were evaluated by iliac bone biopsy to analyse the influence of CAPD on bone histomorphometry. CAPD patients were significantly (p less than 0.05) older (63.1 +\/- 14.0, HD 52.7 +\/- 13.3, CONS 53.3 +\/- 11.7). Compared to HD the results were as follows: CAPD patients required significantly less aluminium to control hyperphosphatemia (0.16 vs. 0.49 g, p less than 0.005). They had a significantly lower incidence of symptomatic bone disease (p less than 0.05). Histomorphometry showed significantly lower osteoid volume (4.3 + 2.8% vs. 8.6 + 5.5%, p less than 0.05) and aluminium labelling intensity (0.15 vs. 1.0, p less than 0.05). Apart from bone mass indices, other histomorphometric variables showed an insignificantly more favourable trend in CAPD patients compared to HD. CONS patients had a significantly lower bone formation rate than CAPD (p less than 0.05), but otherwise no histomorphometric differences were observed. We conclude that CAPD patients require less aluminium therapy, have a lower risk of aluminium bone contamination, and may have a lower risk of developing uremic osteodystrophy.","1417":"Orally administered essential amino acids and their nitrogen free analogues have been shown to ameliorate hyperphosphatemia in uremic patients. The aim of the study was to assess the effect on serum phosphate and ionized calcium of a mixture of non-essential and essential amino acids, administered intra peritoneally as a 1% solution to a group of uremic patients who had been on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) for at least three months. Serum phosphate and ionized calcium were measured at fortnightly intervals during the study period which lasted 16 weeks. All patients performed four 2 liter exchanges with dextrose dialysis solution for the first 4 weeks. Two of the four exchanges were then replaced by a 1% amino acid (AA) dialysis solution for a period of 8 weeks after which all patients reverted to their original regimen. Serum phosphate and calcium were measured fortnightly for a further 4 weeks. Serum phosphate fell significantly after introduction of the AA dialysis solution despite unchanged dietary protein and phosphate intake and no increase in the dose of oral phosphate binders taken by 2 of the 7 patients. Serum ionized calcium remained unchanged during the study period.","1418":"Peritoneal effluent in CAPD patients is the result of the interaction between dialysate and patient through the peritoneal membrane. Among the factors transferred from the patient to dialysate are solutes capable of stimulating fibroblasts: Interleukin-I, Interferon-gamma, and other proteins. Insulin is a well known mitogenic coadjuvant able to act sinergistically with other mitogens in the stimulation of fibroblast proliferation under experimental conditions. Our objective has been to study the effect of insulin added to dialysate in vivo on the in vitro mitogen-induced capacity of the nocturnal peritoneal effluent in 8 diabetics. Two different samples were studied: basal and with in vivo added insulin with the patients' usual doses. A Swiss 3T3 line of mice fibroblasts was used for studies, adding 50 microliters of peritoneal effluent. To confirm in vivo potential mitogenic activity, we also added PDBu (Phorbol dibuturate), a well known mitogenic agent, to both samples. Furthermore, another growth factor, EGF (Epidermal growth factor), was also added to 5 other samples. Insulin addition to the CAPD bag transforms a non-mitogenic peritoneal effluent into a mitogenic one (mean: 4.4 times over basal). At the doses used in vivo there is no linear correlation between insulin dose and DNA synthesis (r: -0.28, NS). Both PDBu and EGF in vitro addition induced a remarkable increment in the mitogenic capacity of the peritoneal effluent. We conclude that insulin added to CAPD bags behaves as a remarkable mitogenic coadjuvant for mice fibroblasts. Consequently, its long-term and universal clinical use should be reconsidered.","1419":"Atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP) is a hormone liberated from the heart during atrial stretch (volume overload). In order to determine if ANP levels are altered in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) or affected by the dialysis procedure itself, we measured plasma ANP in patients before and after peritoneal infusion of two liters of 1.5% Dianeal dialysate and in dialysate subsequently drained from these patients. Plasma ANP is elevated in CAPD patients, but is not affected by infusion of dialysate. ANP is cleared from plasma by peritoneal dialysis.","1420":"We have previously documented the presence of anti-viral activity in the peritoneal effluent of uremic patients treated by peritoneal dialysis. Anti-viral activity was determined by recording the inhibition of the cytopathic effect (CPE) of various viruses on Vero cells in a semi-quantitative manner based on observer's subjective judgment of the degree of inhibition of CPE. This degree of inhibition is a measure of the anti-viral activity. Although peritoneal dialysis effluent (PDE) was consistently seen to inhibit CPE we sought a quantitative method to accurately assess such anti-viral activity. To this end, the CPE of Parainfluenza virus (Para-3) on human kidney (Hu-K) cells was evaluated. The CPE of this virus is manifested by distinct plaques which can be easily counted after staining the tissue culture plate. Eighty-three (83) samples of PDE (0.5 ml) were added to Hu-K cells after which Para-3 was added. As control para-3 on Hu-K was used. The number of plaques obtained by virus control was taken as 100% CPE. The anti-viral activity of PDE was then recorded as the percentage of the CPE shown by virus control and averaged 20.9 +\/- 28.6% (p less than 0.001 vs virus control). In addition PDE was diluted down to 1\/64 concentration and the inhibitory effect again determined. Percent CPE of undiluted, 1\/2, 1\/64 PDE samples were 18.11 +\/- 24.2, 33.57 +\/- 18.16 and 77.93 +\/- 17.4% respectively (p less than 0.01 between undiluted and 1\/64 PDE). These data reaffirm that PDE possesses an inherent anti-viral activity which can now be quantitatively assessed using Para-3 on Hu-K cells.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)","1421":"The elevated serum lysozyme activity in 13 chronic renal failure patients (n = 26) dropped significantly during their first three months of CAPD and subsequently returned to initial levels. When compared with peritoneal mass transfer of lysozyme and serum creatinine levels, a distinct correlation was observed between these and the fluctuations in serum lysozyme activity recorded up to three years of CAPD (r = 0.319, P less than 0.05 and r = 0.425, P less than 0.025, respectively). A notable drop in the mass transfer of this low molecular weight protein took place after the first hour of dialysis. We concluded that long-term CAPD does not affect serum lysozyme activity and that passive loss across the peritoneal membrane could account for the lysozyme found in the effluent fluid.","1422":"We studied the phagocytic capacity of peritoneal macrophages (PM) isolated from effluents after 4 different dwell times (1.5 to 15 hours) in six stable CAPD patients. In addition IgG and C3 levels as well as opsonic activity of the effluents were measured. Both IgG levels and opsonic activity increased significantly with prolonged dwell times. The same held true for the number of phagocytes and their phagocytic capacity. Thus prolonged dwell time enhanced both opsonic activity and phagocytic capacity significantly. As in CCPD the dwell time period between (dis)connection procedures is much longer than in CAPD, this might play an important role in the lower peritonitis rate among CCPD-treated patients.","1423":"We analyzed the in vitro effects of monophosphoryl lipid A (MPLA), a nontoxic bacterial endotoxin-derived immunomodulant, on the depressed immune functions of peritoneal lymphocytes (PLy) and macrophages (PMO) of 6 CAPD patients with relapsing bacterial peritonitis. MPLA was also tested for its capacity to stimulate the peritoneal fibroblast proliferation as determined by 3H-thymidine incorporation. In vitro incubation of PLy and PMO with escalating doses of MPLA up to 5 micrograms\/ml, resulted in a dose-dependent enhancement of Gamma-Interferon (Gamma-IFN) and Interleukin-2 (IL-2) production by PLy, and Interleukin-1 (IL-1) by PMO. There was also an increase in PMO bacterial killing and membrane Fc receptor number, while no change in peritoneal fibroblast proliferation was seen with any of the MPLA concentrations tested. These results suggest that the peritoneal leukocyte abnormalities observed in some high peritonitis rate CAPD patients may be reversed, to some degree, by MPLA, without directly inducing a potentially deleterious peritoneal fibrosis.","1424":"Rifampin shows unique antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus epidermidis biofilms, although in the in vitro situation rifampin resistance emerges rapidly by the selection of preexisting resistant mutants present in a small number in any large bacterial population. Fresh peritoneal dialysis solution is synergistic with rifampin suppressing rifampin resisters. The antimicrobial properties of rifampin are affected by heparin and protamine in entirely different directions. Heparin blocks the action of rifampin whereas protamine is synergistic producing a total bactericidal outcome. Protamine, when combined with heparin, unexpectedly did not influence the ability of heparin to antagonize rifampin. The mechanisms involved are unknown. The results are discussed in terms of known characteristics of the drugs and of the biofilm surface.","1425":"Infection associated with medical devices may be resistant to conventional antibiotic therapy. A potential mechanism explaining this variable therapeutic response is the presence of bacterial biofilms on the surface of the prosthetic material which may confer a biologically important protective function to the entrapped bacteria. To study these questions, we prepared standardized biofilms and conventional fluid phase cultures from a panel of ten Staphylococcus epidermidis strains. All ten strains showed in the fluid phase a variable pattern of sensitivity to seven antibiotics but were uniformly sensitive to rifampin and vancomycin. In the biofilm phase they demonstrated solid antibiotic resistance with the variable exception of rifampin. The nature of the milieu was a major variable. Fresh peritoneal dialysis solution enhanced the activity of rifampin but this effect was not present with spent or neutral dialysis fluids.","1426":"A prior report has suggested that loading doses of intraperitoneal Vancoled (vancomycin, Lederle) cause chemical peritonitis in patients with catheter infections. The present open-label study was conducted to determine the effects of a 30 mg\/kg intraperitoneal loading dose of Vancoled given to five patients with a culture-positive, erythematous, draining exit-site infection. Prior to dosing, all dialysate was drained and sent for baseline cell count and culture. The loading dose was added to the dialysate and infused in the usual fashion. A sample of dialysate was drained at two hours and sent for cell count and culture. The entire exchange was drained at four hours and also sent for cell count and culture. Serum vancomycin concentrations wer measured at four hours. Baseline dialysate contained less than 9 white blood cells per microliter in all patients. Two and four hour samples contained less than 4 and less than 11 white blood cells per microliter, respectively. All fluid was sterile. WB C differential counts were unremarkable. No adverse effects occurred. The mean serum vancomycin concentration was 26.5 micrograms\/ml. Intraperitoneal Vancoled did not cause chemical peritonitis and was well-tolerated by patients with exit-site infections.","1427":"We describe the use of vancomycin in the therapy of gram-positive peritonitis in patients on CAPD. Two ways of administration were in comparison: a) the intraperitoneal (IP) route, with the intraperitoneal administration of 30 mg\/l vancomycin for 10 days and b) the intravenous (IV) route with 2 infusions of 1 gram of vancomycin, the first one on the day of the diagnosis of gram-positive peritonitis and the second 7 days later. Each one of these therapeutic schedules was applied at random for 20 episodes of peritonitis out of 40 episodes with gram-positive organisms (28 Staph. albus, 10 Staph aureus and 2 Streptococcus). Remission of clinical symptoms occurred in 49-72 hours in both groups, while macroscopic clearing of dialysate effluent and sterilization of cultures were observed in 4-7 days. Recurrence of peritonitis was seen in 4 patients of the IV group 2 weeks after the administration of the second dose of vancomycin. We conclude that the use of vancomycin with either of the two ways of administration is of great value in the treatment of gram-positive peritonitis. The IV infusion was less successful but it seems to be useful for the out-patient treatment of gram-positive peritonitis.","1428":"Survival and growth of bacteria within peritoneal macrophages has been implicated as causes of recurrences and relapses of Staphylococcus epidermidis peritonitis. We compared the effect of cephradine--known not to penetrate into peritoneal macrophages--with that of clindamycin--known to concentrate in phagocytes--on the intracellular killing of S. epidermidis by human peritoneal macrophages. Clindamycine (q.i.d. 300 mg) or cephradine (q.i.d. 250 mg) was taken orally for one day in a randomized cross-over setting by 8 stable CAPD patients. On both days peritoneal macrophages were isolated from the overnight effluents and their capacity to phagocytize and kill S. epidermidis was measured. Phagocytes isolated from and incubated in effluents containing clindamycin, showed better bacterial uptake (32 vs 17%, p less than 0.01) and killing (70 vs 42%, p less than 0.01) compared to cephradine. Moreover, clindamycin prevented S. epidermidis to multiply intracellularly (-0.33 decrease in log colony forming units (cfu)\/ml after 18 h). In sharp contrast, phagocytes incubated with cephradine allowed S. epidermidis to increase over 18 h (+1.48 increase in log cfu\/ml; p less than 0.01 compared to clindamycin). We conclude that antibiotics with the ability to suppress intracellular bacterial growth may provide a more optimal treatment of CAPD-related peritonitis.","1429":"To date, the medical literature suggests that CAPD patients with peritonitis have an increase in the dialysate white cell count (greater than 100 cells mL) with neutrophilia (greater than 50%). In order to explore the differential composition of the peritoneal fluid cells (P.F.C.), we have followed 21 patients (PTS) twice a month over a 30-month period. Nine hundred and fifty samples obtained either from the 24 hours (hrs) drained CAPD fluid, or from the \"First Morning Exchange\" (F.M.E.) during the same day, when possible, were estimated with the \"Millipore Filter\" (5-8 Micron (lw) pore size), stained by the Papanicolau method. The results can be so summarized: (1) 13 PTS (62%) showed constantly a low polynuclear count (3-32%); (2) 8 non-infected PTS (38%) showed constantly a higher neutrophilia (40-80%); and (3) from time to time the PTS of the two groups showed a higher neutrophilia and an increased cellularity during clinical infection. In all the samples, the differential P.F.C. count was not affected by the dialysate composition and no difference was observed between the 24 hrs samples and the F.M.E. samples made on the same day. Differential peritoneal cell count may be useful when there are important changes in the stable individual composition.","1430":"No differences in lymphatic absorption ratio were observed using different osmotic agents (Glucose, Amino acid, glycorol). The differences in UF rate and intraperitoneal volumes during dialysis with these osmotic agents are soley dependent on the interactions between the osmotic agents (nature, strength) and the peritoneal membrane.","1431":"We have demonstrated the role in some CAPD patients with ultrafiltration (UF) loss of an increased peritoneal lymphocyte (PLy) and macrophage (PMO) Ca++ concentration in the release of large amounts of gamma-Interferon (gamma-IFN) and Interleukin-1 (IL-1), which stimulate peritoneal fibroblast proliferation. We have also shown in vitro and in vivo that the calcium channel blocker verapamil (VPM) is able to normalize the previously high Ca++ PLy and PMO concentration and cytokine release, to decrease fibroblast proliferation, and to increase UF in only 60% of the CAPD patients with UF loss due to a cytokine-mediated hyperproliferation of peritoneal fibroblasts, while in the remaining 40% there is little improvement in UF (VPM responders and low-responders, respectively). To evaluate which mechanisms in addition to passive Ca++ influx can play a role in the Ca(++)-dependent activation of peritoneal immune-cells, we evaluated in 6 CAPD VPM low-responder patients the effects of in vitro of different doses of Ca++ and 1,25(OH)2D3 on: 1) PLy and PMO cytoplasmic Ca++ levels in the PLy and PMO cytoplasm; 2) gamma-IFN and IL-1 release by PLy and PMO; 3) peritoneal fibroblast proliferation. Results showed a direct correlation between Ca++ levels in the medium and the PLy and PMO Ca++ concentrations, IL-1 and gamma-IFN release, and peritoneal fibroblast proliferation. These effects were enhanced by the addition of low doses of 1,25(OH)2D3 to the medium, while both high 1,25(OH)2D3 doses and verapamil abrogated the Ca+(+)-induced PLy and PMO activation. These results underline the importance of both Ca++ and 1,25(OH)2D3 in peritoneal immune-cell activation and peritoneal fibroblast proliferation, and may offer a new prophylactic approach for preventing UF loss in CAPD.","1432":"Ca++ has been proposed as an intracellular second messenger for the activation of immune cells. An immune regulatory role for 1,25(OH)2D3 has also been suggested. We therefore evaluated the role of Ca++ and 1,25(OH)2D3 in the depressed antibacterial functions of 8 CAPD patients with relapsing bacterial peritonitis by evaluating in vitro the effects of escalating concentrations of 1,25(OH)2D3 and\/or Ca++ on: 1. peritoneal macrophage (PMO) cytoplasmic Ca++; 2. PMO superoxide generation; 3. PMO leukotriene B4 release, 4. PMO bacterial killing. Results showed a dose-dependent increase in all parameters for Ca++ concentrations from 500 to 3,000 microM while with both a CA(++)-free medium and with Ca++ concentrations of 5,000 microM of medium all the aforementioned functions were abrogated. Addition of low doses of 1,25(OH)2D3 strongly potentiated the stimulatory effect of Ca++ on cell functions, while high doses were inhibitory. These in vitro data underline the importance of Ca++ and 1,25(OH)2D3 in PMO antibacterial functions in CAPD patients, and may be useful in the prophylaxis and therapy of peritonitis.","1433":"","1434":"Glucose has several disadvantages such as low pH, high osmolality and hyperglycemia. Rapid glucose absorption contributes to hyperlipidemia, obesity and ultrafiltration failure in peritoneal dialysis patients. Two commercially available plasma substitutes 10% hydroxyethylstarch (HES) and 6% dextran were studied for ultrafiltration and absorption patterns. 18 ml of each solution were instilled into the peritoneal cavity of 6 non-uremic rats. HES yielded a significantly (p less than 0.02) greater ultrafiltration after 6 h of dwell, whereas 2.3% glucose solution showed the typical ultrafiltration pattern of an easily absorbable osmotic agent. With 6% dextran ultrafiltration was markedly lower. At the end of cycle time the mean absorption rates for HES were 62.7% and 41.5% for dextran. It is concluded that HES is a potent osmotic agent due to sustained colloidal ultrafiltration. However, despite their high molecular weights both solutions were markedly absorbed probably by lymphatics. However, accumulation in tissues and undefined metabolic pathways might prove disadvantageous in patients with ESRD."},"articletitle":{"0":"Treatment of a Dialysate Leak by Simultaneous Catheter Removal and Replacement in a Patient Undergoing Continuous Ambulatory Peritoneal Dialysis.","1":"A Rare Complication During Percutaneous Peritoneal Dialysis Catheter Insertion: Intravesical Placement.","2":"Is It Safe to Initiate Peritoneal Dialysis Treatment Immediately After Percutaneous Catheter Placement?","3":"Better Healing of the Exit Site with Negative-Pressure Wound Therapy.","4":"When Love Hurts, It Leaves No Options!
