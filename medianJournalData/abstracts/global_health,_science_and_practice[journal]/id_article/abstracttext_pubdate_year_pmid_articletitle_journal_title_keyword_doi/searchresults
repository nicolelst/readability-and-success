acute malnutrition (SAM) can have high mortality, especially in very ill children treated in the hospital. Many medical and nursing schools do not adequately, if at all, teach how to manage children with SAM. There is a dearth of experienced practitioners and trainers to serve as exemplars of good practice or participate in capacity development. We consider 4 country studies of scaling up implementation of WHO guidelines for improving the inpatient management of SAM within under-resourced public sector health services in South Africa, Bolivia, Malawi, and Ghana. Drawing on implementation reports, qualitative and quantitative data from our research, prospective and retrospective data collection, self-reflection, and our shared experiences, we review our capacity-building approaches for improving quality of care, implementation effectiveness, and lessons learned. These country studies provide important evidence that improved inpatient management of SAM is scalable in routine health services and scalability is achievable within different contexts and health systems. Effectiveness in reducing inpatient SAM deaths appears to be retained at scale.The country studies show evidence of impact on mortality early in the implementation and scaling-up process. However, it took many years to build workforce capacity, establish monitoring and mentoring procedures, and institutionalize the guidelines within health systems. Key features for success included collaborations to build capacity and undertake operational research and advocacy for guideline adoption; specialist teams to mentor and build confidence and competency through supportive supervision; and political commitment and administrative policies for sustainability. For frontline staff to be confident in their ability to deliver appropriate care competently, an enabling environment and supportive policies and processes are needed at all levels of the health system.","2":"In 2017, aligned with global World Health Organization tetanus guidelines, Vietnam prepared evidence to support a recommendation to introduce the tetanus-diphtheria (Td) vaccine into routine immunization. This study aimed to provide evidence on the costs and budgetary impact of the potential replacement of the tetanus-toxoid (TT) vaccine with the Td vaccine, considering different possible delivery strategies. We used an activity-based ingredients costing approach to estimate the 2017 program costs of providing TT vaccination to girls aged 15-16 years and conducting Td campaigns in outbreak areas. We performed a budget impact analysis for 2018-2025 using the cost per dose estimates based on the current delivery of these vaccines. We assumed complete cessation of TT vaccination of girls aged 15-16 years and a transition period where Td outbreak control campaigns would still occur. Td vaccine was assumed to be provided to children aged 7 years using either facility- or school-based delivery or combined facility- and school-based delivery. The delivery cost per dose for current TT vaccination for girls aged 15-16 years was US$1.49 for school-based delivery, US$1.76 for facility-based delivery, and US$3.86 for delivery via outreach. Td vaccination through campaigns was estimated to cost US$3.56\/dose. During 2018-2025, replacing the TT vaccine for girls aged 15-16 years with the Td vaccine for children aged 7 years is estimated to save US$4.61 million in immunization delivery costs if a school-based delivery strategy is used or US$1.04 million if facility-based delivery is used. Compared to the current plan, delivery of Td routine vaccination via a school-based strategy was the most cost saving. These results were used in late 2019 to support the delivery of Td vaccination using a school-based delivery strategy for children aged 7 years in 30 Northern provinces in Vietnam. ","3":"The Program to Reduce Maternal Deaths in Tanzania was a 13-year (2006-2019) effort in the Kigoma region that evolved over 3 phases to improve and sustain the availability of, access to, and demand for high-quality maternal and reproductive health care services. The Program intended to bring high-quality care closer to more communities. Cutting across the Program was the routine collection of monitoring and evaluation data. The Program achieved significant reductions in maternal and perinatal mortality, a significant increase in the modern contraceptive prevalence rate, and a significant decline in the unmet need for contraception. By 2017, it was apparent that the Program was on track to meet or surpass many of the targets established by the Government of Tanzania. Over the following 2-plus years, efforts to sustain Program interventions intensified. In April 2019, the Program fully transitioned to Government of Tanzania oversight. Four key lessons were learned during implementation that are relevant to governments, donors, and implementing organizations working to reduce maternal mortality: (1) multistakeholder partnerships are critical; (2) demand creation for services, while critical, must rest on a foundation of well-functioning and high-quality clinical services; (3) it is imperative to not only collect robust monitoring and evaluation data, but to be responsive in real time to what the data reveal; and, (4) it is necessary to develop a deliberate sustainability strategy from the start. The Program in Kigoma demonstrates that decentralizing high-quality maternal and reproductive health services in remote, low-resource settings is both feasible and effective and should be considered in places with similar contexts. By embedding the Program in the existing health system, and through efforts to build local capacity, the improvements seen in Kigoma are likely to be sustained. Follow-up evaluations are planned, providing an opportunity to more directly assess sustainability.","4":"","5":"Global health partnerships (GHPs) involve complex relationships between individuals and organizations, often joining partners from high-income and low- or middle-income countries around work that is carried out in the latter. Therefore, GHPs are situated in the context of global inequities and their underlying sociopolitical and historical causes, such as colonization. Equity is a core principle that should guide GHPs from start to end. How equity is embedded and nurtured throughout a partnership has remained a constant challenge. We have developed a user-friendly tool for valuing a GHP throughout its lifespan using an equity lens. The development of the EQT was informed by 5 distinct elements: a scoping review of scientific published peer-reviewed literature; an online survey and follow-up telephone interviews; workshops in Canada, Burkina Faso, and Vietnam; a critical interpretive synthesis; and a content validation exercise. Findings suggest GHPs generate experiences of equity or inequity yet provide little guidance on how to identify and respond to these experiences. The EQT can guide people involved in partnering to consider the equity implications of all their actions, from inception, through implementation and completion of a partnership. When used to guide reflective dialogue with a clear intention to advance equity in and through partnering, this tool offers a new approach to valuing global health partnerships. Global health practitioners, among others, can apply the EQT in their partnerships to learning together about how to cultivate equity in their unique contexts within what is becoming an increasingly diverse, vibrant, and responsive global health community.","6":"About 50% of individuals needing HIV treatment are unable to access required services primarily due to the inability of the Nigerian HIV treatment program to meet patient needs. We explored patient willingness to pay for HIV treatment, which can inform the feasibility of cost recovery through patient fees to contribute to the funding of HIV treatment services in Nigeria. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 400 people living with HIV randomly selected from 15 health care facilities providing free HIV treatment services in 2 medium and high HIV burden states (Lagos, Enugu) and the Federal Capital Territory Abuja. We calculated the elasticity of the price that patients were willing to pay per month relative to the estimated current cost of providing HIV treatment services per patient and determined the patient coverage and potential cost recovery at each price point. We found that 92% of patients were willing to pay for HIV treatment. The mean amount patients were willing to pay was 3,000 naira (US$7.50) per month with about 18% of patients willing to pay the current monthly price of 5000 naira (US$12.50). The availability of financial support from family and friends (odds ratio [OR]=14.209; P=.001; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.151, 0.285), lack of employment (OR=0.190; P=.02; 95% CI=0.015, 0.202), monthly income (OR=2.476; P&lt;.001; 95% CI=84.698, 737.233), and change in monthly income (OR=2.015; P&lt;.001; 95% CI=0.003, 0.229) were associated with willingness to pay. Many Nigerian patients are willing to contribute to funding for HIV treatment and this can enhance domestic funding for HIV treatment and equitable access to treatment through proper segmentation of patients based on willingness and capacity to pay. Measures must be put in place to reduce the cost of accessing HIV treatment and promote financial empowerment of people living with HIV to improve willingness to pay for treatment. ","7":"Translation of knowledge into policy and practice is important to prevent sexual reproductive health and rights (SRHR)-related morbidity and mortality and ensure access to rights. Existing approaches to knowledge translation are often relatively rigid and implicitly assume linear processes, leading to time-consuming processes that are not tailored to countries' needs. SRHR knowledge platforms designed and implemented a collaborative rapid improvement model for knowledge translation (CRIM-KT) in Burundi, Bangladesh, Indonesia, and Jordan. The approach consisted of learning sessions and action periods aimed at improving policies and practices addressing the prevention of child marriage and teenage pregnancies. To evaluate the approach, a participatory action learning process took place throughout the implementation (September 2017 and January 2019). An end evaluation was conducted using a desk review of project documentation, in-depth interviews, and a focus group discussion to document the process, outcomes, and lessons learned. In Indonesia, a local government policy was changed that aims to prevent child marriage by avoiding misinterpretation of a local cultural practice. In Jordan, the cabinet endorsed a national action plan to prevent child marriage and changes in practice took place. In Burundi, no tangible changes in policy and practice in SRHR were observed. In Bangladesh, practice changed by strengthening coordination for collaboration and exchange among stakeholders to prevent child marriage. In all countries, the approach considerably strengthened participants' knowledge translation capacities. The CRIM-KT led to improvements in policy and practice in a relatively short time frame and different contexts. This can be explained by the systematic, structured, and participatory approach, allowing for contextual adaptation and involvement of stakeholders, as well as the cross-learning on 2 levels (international and country collaboration teams). The principles of the CRIM-KT may be further developed and applied in other fields in global health to strengthen knowledge translation processes. ","8":"Despite remarkable progress in controlling HIV and TB, Uganda is one of the 30 high-burden TB\/HIV countries. Approximately 53,000 Ugandans had a new HIV diagnosis in 2019, and approximately 88,000 Ugandans had a TB diagnosis in 2020. Fellows in the Uganda Public Health Fellowship Program (UPHFP) work directly with the Ministry of Health AIDS and TB Control Programs, the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, UPHFP supervisors, and implementing partners to investigate and evaluate HIV-related and TB-related issues. These activities have contributed to the Uganda HIV and TB programs. UPHFP fellows complete projects in 7 competency domains, including outbreak investigations, surveillance evaluations, and data quality improvement. Priority HIV\/AIDS\/TB information gaps\/topics are identified in consultation with key stakeholders, and fellows complete projects to guide program improvements and policy decisions. During 2015-2020, UPHFP fellows implemented 127 HIV and TB projects covering key program areas in AIDS and TB control programs, including care and treatment (16 projects), TB\/HIV (18), prevention of mother-to-child HIV transmission (24), key and priority populations (9), pre-exposure and post-exposure prophylaxis (7), adolescent girls and young women (6), service delivery (13), and diagnosis of TB including drug-resistant TB and TB in high-risk groups (32). These projects have helped improve retention, quality of care, and treatment outcomes for people living with HIV, HIV and TB coinfected patients, and TB patients. They have also contributed to the decrease in pediatric TB and infant HIV positivity rates and improved service delivery for key populations. UPHFP results were disseminated to relevant stakeholders such as government departments, implementing partners, districts, and the general community and guided decision making. UPHFP has significantly improved HIV and TB control in Uganda. Other countries with similar programs could benefit from this approach and utilize program fellows to support HIV and TB control.","9":"To address high levels of maternal mortality in Kigoma, Tanzania, stakeholders increased women's access to high-quality comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) by decentralizing services from hospitals to health centers where EmONC was delivered mostly by associate clinicians and nurses. To ensure that women used services, implementers worked to continuously improve and sustain quality of care while creating demand. Program evaluation included periodic health facility assessments, pregnancy outcome monitoring, and enhanced maternal mortality detection region-wide in program- and nonprogram-supported health facilities. Between 2013 and 2018, the average number of lifesaving interventions performed per facility increased from 2.8 to 4.7. The increase was higher in program-supported than nonprogram-supported health centers and dispensaries. The institutional delivery rate increased from 49% to 85%; the greatest increase occurred through using health centers (15% to 25%) and dispensaries (21% to 46%). The number of cesarean deliveries almost doubled, and the population cesarean delivery rate increased from 2.6% to 4.5%. Met need for emergency obstetric care increased from 44% to 61% while the direct obstetric case fatality rate declined from 1.8% to 1.4%. The institutional maternal mortality ratio across all health facilities declined from 303 to 174 deaths per 100,000 live births. The total stillbirth rate declined from 26.7 to 12.8 per 1,000 births. The predischarge neonatal mortality rate declined from 10.7 to 7.6 per 1,000 live births. Changes in case fatality rate and maternal mortality were driven by project-supported facilities. Changes in neonatal mortality varied depending on facility type and program support status. Decentralizing high-quality comprehensive EmONC delivered mostly by associate clinicians and nurses led to significant improvements in the availability and utilization of lifesaving care at birth in Kigoma. Dedicated efforts to sustain high-quality EmONC along with supplemental programmatic components contributed to the reduction of maternal and perinatal mortality. ","10":"Standard measures of contraceptive prevalence have known biases given that they do not reflect sexual activity and true exposure to the risk of an unintended pregnancy. In this study, we aim to understand the extent to which women protect themselves against unintended pregnancy, taking into account exposure to sex, by examining contraceptive use patterns by marital status and recent sexual activity. Data come from population-based surveys of reproductive age women in 9 low-resource settings. We estimated contraceptive prevalence using (1) the standard current contraceptive use measure, (2) a new measure of contraceptive use at last sex, and (3) a comprehensive measure that combines current use and use at last sex. Analyses are stratified by site and examine patterns by marital status only, and by both marital status and sexual activity separately. We then examined method mix by each contraceptive measure. Study findings reveal distinct patterns in contraceptive use in relation to marital status and sexual recency across sites. Overall, married women tended to report higher levels of current contraceptive use compared to use at last sex, whereas unmarried women reported higher levels of contraceptive use at last sex. When examining these measures by sexual activity and marital status, results indicate lower levels of contraceptive use among women who had not had sex in the month prior to the survey, for both married and unmarried women. The comprehensive measure of contraceptive use yielded the highest estimates, by design. Method mix varied consistently by contraceptive measure, with current use tending to capture more permanent and long-acting methods and use at last sex more likely to capture short-acting and coital-dependent methods. These findings have important implications for how the family planning field evaluates unintended pregnancy risk and unmet need for contraception within low-resource settings, given different estimates yield discrepant estimates for who is \"at risk.\" ","11":"","12":"","13":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic and resulting lockdowns have disrupted health care service delivery globally. This includes disruptions in harm reduction and HIV service delivery for people who inject drugs (PWID), a population at high risk for not only COVID-19 but also poor HIV and drug-treatment access. However, little is known about these issues in Kazakhstan. We examined harm reduction provider experiences with delivering services and regulatory changes during the COVID-19 pandemic. We conducted in-depth interviews with 24 nurses, social workers, and doctors serving both HIV-positive and HIV-negative PWID at 13 needle and syringe programs (NSPs) and 4 AIDS Centers (HIV treatments centers) in Kazakhstan from May to August 2020. Participants were asked how the COVID-19 pandemic had impacted their PWID clients' risks, their organizational environment, and the services offered to PWID over the prior 3-6 months. Thematic content analysis was used to elicit findings. The COVID-19 pandemic considerably impacted NSP and AIDS Center operations. Participants perceived high risks of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus-2 (SARS-CoV-2) infection for themselves and their clients, as well as pandemic-related increases in substance use and HIV risks for clients. Organizations instituted several policy and regulatory changes to adapt to the pandemic, most notably tasking NSPs with delivering HIV medications; these changes necessitated new roles and responsibilities for many providers. Despite this stressful changing environment and increased service demands, participants still shared examples of persistence and resilience as they worked to meet client needs during these challenging times. NSPs in Kazakhstan are well-positioned to reach key populations with crucial information and flexible services during the COVID-19 pandemic. However, they need recognition as essential organizations and additional equipment and staff support to protect staff and clients, maintain pandemic-related regulatory changes, and address additional challenges such as overdose prevention among clients. ","14":"","15":"In India, a large network of self-help groups (SHGs) implements interventions to improve women's and children's health and nutrition. There is growing evidence on the effectiveness of women's group interventions to improve health but limited information on implementation intensity, including how often groups meet, for how long, and with whom, despite this often being cited as a key factor for success. We aimed to assess the implementation intensity of large SHG-based health and nutrition interventions with rural, low-income women, to inform program design, delivery, and measurement. We synthesized process data from surveys, meeting observations, and process evaluations across 8 maternal and child health and nutrition interventions in India. We examined the implementation intensity of 3 common intervention delivery channels: group meetings, home visits, and community-level activities. SHG members spent approximately 30 minutes in monthly meetings discussing health or nutrition. SHG dissolution or limited participation in meetings was a common challenge. Beyond group meetings, home visits reached approximately 1 in 3 households with an SHG member. Pregnant and breastfeeding women's participation in community events varied across interventions. Interventions that aim to capitalize on existing networks of financial women's groups not specifically formed for health and nutrition objectives, such as SHGs, will need to have an implementation intensity that matches the ambition of their health objectives: substantial changes in behavioral or mortality outcomes are unlikely to be achieved with relatively light intensity. Interventions that require sustained interactions with members to achieve health outcomes need to ensure adequate community and individual outreach to supplement group meetings, as well as improved participation through more intensive community mobilization approaches. Evaluations of group-based interventions should report on implementation intensity to support the interpretation of evaluation evidence and to inform further scale-up. ","16":"Adolescents and young people represent a growing proportion of people living with HIV (AYAHIV), and there is an urgent need to design, implement, and test interventions that retain AYAHIV in care. Using a human-centered design (HCD) approach, we codesigned CombinADO, an intervention to promote HIV viral suppression and improve antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence and retention in care among AYAHIV in Nampula, Mozambique. The HCD process involves formative design research with AYAHIV, health care providers, parents\/caretakers, and experts in adolescent HIV; synthesis of findings to generate action-oriented insights; ideation and prototyping of intervention components; and a pilot study to assess feasibility, acceptability, and uptake of intervention components.CombinADO promotes ART adherence and retention in care by fostering peer connectedness and belonging, providing accessible medical knowledge, demystifying and destigmatizing HIV, and cultivating a sense of hope among AYAHIV. Successful prototypes included a media campaign to reduce HIV stigma and increase medical literacy; a toolkit to help providers communicate and address the unique needs of AYAHIV clients; peer-support groups to improve medical literacy, empower youth, and provide positive role models for people living with HIV; support groups for parents\/caregivers; and discreet pill containers to promote adherence outside the home. In the next phase, the effectiveness of CombinaADO on retention in care, ART adherence, and viral suppression will be evaluated using a cluster-randomized control trial.We demonstrate the utility of using HCD to cocreate a multicomponent intervention to retain AYAHIV in care. We also discuss how the HCD methodology enriches participatory methods and community engagement. This is then illustrated by the youth-driven intervention development of CombinADO by fostering youth empowerment, addressing power imbalances between youth and adult stakeholders, and ensuring that language and content remain adolescent friendly.","17":"The World Health Organization has called for the elimination of hepatitis B virus (HBV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) as public health threats by 2030. In response to the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees requests, Rwanda became the first country to include refugees in its national viral hepatitis prevention and management program in 2019. We used secondary data to describe the implementation of the first HBV and HCV screening program among refugees in Rwanda. Rapid diagnostic tests were used to screen for HBV surface antigen (HBsAg) and HCV antibody (anti-HCV). We used routine data collected during the HBV and HCV mass screening campaign among Burundian refugees living in Mahama camp and program records to estimate the screening coverage, the prevalence of HBV and HCV, and the cost of the campaign. Over 28 days in February and March 2020, 26,498 unique individuals were screened for HBV and HCV, reflecting a screening coverage of 77.9% (95% confidence interval [CI]=76.5%, 78.4%). Coverage was greater than 90% among women aged 30-64 years, but younger age groups and men were less likely to be screened. On average, 946 clients were screened per day. The prevalence of anti-HCV was 1.1% (95% CI=1.0%, 1.3%), and the prevalence of HBsAg was 3.8% (95% CI=3.6%, 4.0%). We estimate that the total cost of the campaign was US$177,336.60, reflecting a per-person-screened cost of US$6.69. Conducting a mass screening was a feasible and effective strategy to achieve high screening coverage and identify refugees who were eligible for HBV and HCV treatment. This screening program in the Mahama refugee camp can serve as a reference for other refugee camps in Rwanda and elsewhere. ","18":"","19":"Implementation research with pre- and post-comparison was planned to improve the quality of evidence-based intrapartum care services in Indian medical schools. We present the baseline study results to assess the status of adherence to intrapartum evidence-based practices (IP-EBP) in study schools in 3 states in India and the perception of the faculty. A concurrent mixed-methods approach was used to conduct the baseline assessment in 9 medical schools in Rajasthan, Gujarat, and Union Territory from October 2018 to June 2019. IP-EBP among pregnant women in uncomplicated first (n=135), second (n=120), and third stage (n=120) of labor were observed using a predesigned, pretested checklist quantitatively. We conducted in-depth interviews with 33 obstetrics and gynecology faculty to understand their perceptions of intrapartum practices. Quantitative data were analyzed using SPSS (version 22). COM-B (Capability, Opportunity, and Motivation Behavior) model was used to understand the behaviors, and thematic analysis was done for the qualitative data. Unindicated augmentation of labor was done in 64.4%, fundal pressure applied in 50.8%, episiotomy done in 58.3%, and delivery in lithotomy position was performed in 86.7% of women in labor. Intrapartum practices that are not recommended were routinely practiced in the study medical schools due to a lack of staff awareness of evidence-based practices and incorrect beliefs about their impact. ","20":"","21":"Evidence of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) in individuals using oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) who acquire HIV is limited to clinical trials and case studies. More data are needed to understand the risk of HIVDR with oral PrEP during PrEP rollout. Mechanisms to collect these data vary, and are dependent on cost, scale of PrEP distribution, and in-country infrastructure for the identification, collection, and testing of samples from PrEP seroconverters. The Global Evaluation of Microbicide Sensitivity (GEMS) project, in collaboration with country stakeholders, initiated HIVDR monitoring among new HIV seroconverters with prior PrEP use in Eswatini, Kenya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe. Standalone protocols were developed to assess HIVDR among a national sample of PrEP users. In addition, HIVDR testing was incorporated into existing demonstration projects for key populations. Countries are supportive of conducting a time-limited evaluation of HIVDR during the early stages of PrEP rollout. As PrEP rollout expands, the need for long-term HIVDR monitoring with PrEP will need to be balanced with maintaining national HIV drug resistance surveillance for pretreatment and acquired drug resistance. Laboratory capacity is a common obstacle to setting up a monitoring system. Establishing HIV resistance monitoring within PrEP programs is feasible. Approaches to drug resistance monitoring may evolve as the PrEP programs mature and expand. The methods and implementation support offered by GEMS assisted countries in developing methods to monitor for drug resistance that best fit their PrEP program needs and resources.

The documentation of practical examples using the MSC technique for an ongoing monitoring purpose is limited. We aim to fill the current gap by documenting and sharing the experience and lessons learned of The Challenge Initiative (TCI), which is scaling up evidence-based family planning (FP) and adolescent and youth sexual and reproductive health (AYSRH) interventions in 11 countries in Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. The qualitative assessment took place in early 2021 to document TCI's use and adaptation of MSC and determine its added value in adaptive management, routine monitoring, and cross-learning efforts. Focus group discussions and key informant interviews were conducted virtually with staff members involved in collecting and selecting MSC stories. TCI has had a positive experience with using MSC to facilitate adaptive management in multiple countries. The use of MSC has created learning opportunities that have helped diffuse evidence-based FP and AYSRH interventions both within and across countries. The responsive feedback step in the MSC process was viewed as indispensable to learning and collaboration. There are several necessary inputs to successful use of the method, including buy-in about the benefits, training on good interviewing techniques and qualitative research, and dedicated staff to manage the process. Our assessment results suggest that the MSC technique is an effective qualitative data collection tool to strengthen routine monitoring and adaptive management efforts that allows for flexibility in how project stakeholders implement the process. The MSC technique could be an important tool for global health practitioners, policy makers, and researchers working on complex interventions because they continually need to understand stakeholders' needs and priorities, learn from lessons and evidence-based practices, and be agile about addressing potential challenges. ","27":"Depot medroxyprogesterone acetate administered subcutaneously (DMPA-SC) is an all-in-one injectable contraceptive administered every 3 months, either by a trained health care provider or community health worker or by training a client to self-inject. Using a prospective cohort of family planning (FP) clients in Ghana, this study explores patterns of DMPA-SC use and mode of injection administration over a 6-month period. This study also examines the predictors of self-injection adoption 6 months after initiating DMPA-SC. Our analysis focuses on 378 women who were using DMPA-SC at the 6-month interview. Adjusted odds ratios accounting for clustering show that clients who were new FP users, never married, or attended high school\/attained higher education were significantly more likely to self-inject by the third injection. Results of this study suggest that in Ghana, adding DMPA-SC to the method mix may improve access to FP, especially among new users. Results of this study may inform FP projects and programs aiming to improve access to contraceptive methods and increase contraceptive prevalence by introducing or scaling up DMPA-SC self-injection. The findings also provide a sociodemographic profile of FP clients most likely to adopt DMPA-SC self-injection over time, which could serve as an evidence base for social marketing strategies.","28":"Diaphragms have never been widely available in West Africa, a region with very low contraceptive use due in part to health system constraints and low demand for other modern methods of contraception. Research has demonstrated the single-size Caya contoured diaphragm to be a safe and effective barrier method of nonhormonal, self-care contraception, offering features that improve upon the design of traditional diaphragms. No studies have measured continuation of Caya. In Niamey, Niger, this pilot introduction study explored Caya acceptability, use, and programmatic considerations. Women in Niger participated in surveys (n=150) and in-depth interviews (n=25) 6 months after adopting Caya. In-depth interviews were also conducted with men in the community (n=15) and family planning providers (n=15). We conducted descriptive analysis of the percentage of adopters who continued to use the method at 6 months and women's reasons for discontinuation among women who completed the 6-month follow-up survey. We used deductive thematic analysis of in-depth interview data from women, men, and providers to understand program elements and other factors associated with acceptability. Six months after initiation, 76.7% (95% confidence interval=0.70, 0.83) of 150 survey respondents reported continued use of Caya. Top reasons for use included: Caya causes no side effects for most users, works on demand, and is reusable for up to 2 years. Roughly one-quarter of women interviewed reported inconsistent use. Some men supported their partner's use; in other cases, women used Caya without informing or involving their partners. Providers described Caya as compatible with the needs of many women and credited pelvic models with enabling effective counseling. The Caya diaphragm has the potential to be a valuable addition to the range of contraceptive options, especially in settings with high levels of opposition to other modern methods. ","29":"Surgery, anesthesia, and obstetric (SAO) care is quickly being recognized for its critical role in cost-effectively improving global morbidity and mortality. Six core indicators for SAO capacity were established in 2015 by the Lancet Commission on Global Surgery (LCoGS) and include: SAO provider density, population proximity to surgery-ready facilities, annual national operative volume, a system to track perioperative mortality rate, and protection from impoverishing and catastrophic expenditures. The surgical capacity of Kenya, a lower-middle-income country, has not been evaluated using this framework. Our goal was to review published literature on surgery in Kenya to assess the country's surgical capacity and system strength. A narrative review of the relevant literature provided estimates for each LCoGS indicator. While progress has been made in expanding access to care across the country, key steps remain in the effort to provide equitable, affordable, and timely care to Kenya's population through universal health coverage. Additional investment into training SAO providers, operative infrastructure, and accessibility are recommended through a national surgery, obstetric, and anesthesia plan.","30":"Gender disparities persist across the HIV care continuum in sub-Saharan Africa. Men are tested, linked, and retained at lower rates than women. Men experience more treatment interruptions, resulting in higher rates of virological failure and increased mortality. Peer support is an approach to improving men's engagement and retention in HIV treatment. We assessed uptake and early retention in HIV care among men in the 'Coach Mpilo' peer support pilot project in South Africa. We conducted a pilot project from March 2020 to September 2020 in 3 districts: Ehlanzeni and Gert Sibande (Mpumalanga) and Ugu (KwaZulu-Natal). Men living with HIV were invited to receive one-on-one coaching from a peer supporter who was stable on treatment. We analyzed participants' self-reported data on demographics, uptake, and retention in HIV treatment. We described baseline characteristics using summary statistics and reported uptake and early retention proportions overall and by testing history (newly and previously diagnosed). Among 4,182 men living with HIV, most were previously diagnosed (n=2,461, 64%) and uptake was high (92%, n=3,848). Short-term retention was 80% (n=1,979) among men previously diagnosed and 88% (n=1,213) among newly diagnosed. In September 2020, 95% (n=3,653\/3,848) of all participants reported being active on HIV treatment, including those retained consistently and those who had interrupted and returned to care. Among participants experiencing treatment interruption after enrolling, the majority (82%, n=464) returned to treatment, largely within 2 months. Improving linkage to and retention in HIV treatment among men is essential for their health and for treatment as prevention. This pilot project provided preliminary evidence that a peer-led support model was acceptable, retained a high proportion of men in the early stages of ART, and supported men returning to care after treatment interruption. These promising results require further investigation to assess impact, scalability, and cost-effectiveness. ","31":"HIV retesting during pregnancy\/postpartum can identify incident maternal HIV infection and prevent mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT). Guidelines recommend retesting HIV-negative peripartum women, but data on implementation are limited. We conducted a cross-sectional study in Kenya to measure the prevalence of maternal HIV retesting in programs and HIV incidence. Programmatic HIV retesting data was abstracted from maternal and child health booklets among women enrolled in a cross-sectional and\/or seeking services during pregnancy, delivery, or 9 months postpartum in Kenya between January 2017 and July 2019. Retesting was defined as any HIV test conducted by MTCT programs after the initial antenatal care test or conducted as part of retesting policies at\/after delivery for women not tested during pregnancy. Poisson generalized linear regression was used to identify correlates of programmatic retesting among women enrolled at 9 months postpartum. Among 5,894 women included in the analysis, 3,124 only had data abstracted and 2,770 were enrolled in a cross-sectional study. Overall prevalence of programmatic HIV retesting was higher at 6 weeks (65%) and 9 months postpartum (72%) than in pregnancy (32%), at delivery (23%) and 6 months postpartum (28%) (P&lt;.001 for all comparisons). HIV incidence was 0.72\/100 person-years (PY) (95% confidence interval (CI)=0.43,1.22) in pregnancy and 0.23\/100 PY (95% CI=0.09, 0.62) postpartum (incidence rate ratio: 3.09; 95% CI=0.97, 12.90; P=.02). Maternal retest coverage was high at 6 weeks and 9 months postpartum but low during pregnancy. Strategies to ensure high retesting coverage and detect women with incident maternal HIV infection are needed.

Core to HC3 Guinea was the promotion of quality local health centers through the Gold Star campaign (2016-2017). The current study aimed to determine the relationship between campaign exposure and attitudes\/intentions regarding local health centers, to inform communication efforts in future epidemics. Between June-July 2017, HC3 Guinea conducted a telephone survey with men (n=1,000) and women (n=2,000) aged 18-49 years. Multivariate regression analyses estimated the association between campaign exposure and attitudinal\/intention outcomes for the overall sample as well as for gender- and education-stratified samples.Survey results indicated that more than 30% of the sample recalled either the campaign (32.5%) or logo (37.6%). Statistically significant associations existed between exposure and various attitudinal outcomes. For example, regardless of gender\/level of education, campaign recall was strongly associated with agreeing that the local health center improved in the last 6 months. Given that the campaign itself was short in duration, it is encouraging that attitudes changed with campaign exposure. Although a greater percentage of women than men held positive attitudes about health facilities, men seemed more influenced by campaign exposure.The current study provides evidence that mass media campaigns can help rebuild trust in health care facilities after an epidemic. Study findings also stress the value of conducting stratified analyses by important demographic characteristics (e.g., gender, education). Stratified analyses can help identify meaningful differences and better tailor health promotion activities and achieve greater success. The recent recurrence of Ebola in Guinea has resulted in renewed discussions about ways to incorporate these evaluation findings into current programming, including exploring ways to address gender considerations in message design and overall program strategy.","35":"The transition from paper to digital systems requires quality assurance of the underlying content and application of data standards for interoperability. The World Health Organization (WHO) developed digital adaptation kits (DAKs) as an operational and software-neutral mechanism to translate WHO guidelines into a standardized format that can be more easily incorporated into digital systems. WHO convened health program area and digital leads, reviewed existing approaches for requirements gathering, mapped to established standards, and incorporated research findings to define DAK components. For each health domain area, the DAKs distill WHO guidelines to specify the health interventions, personas, user scenarios, business process workflows, core data elements mapped to terminology codes, decision-support logic, program indicators, and functional and nonfunctional requirements. DAKs aim to catalyze quality of care and facilitate data use and interoperability as part of WHO's vision of SMART (Standards-based, Machine-readable, Adaptive, Requirements-based, and Testable) guidelines. Efforts will be needed to strengthen a collaborative approach for the uptake of DAKs within the local digital ecosystem and national health policies. ","36":"","37":"As the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic spread, meeting the testing needs to control the spread of infection became a major challenge worldwide. In Pakistan, the lack of the requisite infrastructure and training compounded the acute shortage of testing kits and other consumables. Against this backdrop and to urgently improve province-wide access to high-quality COVID-19 polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing with rapid turnaround times, the Government of the Sindh (GoS) province of Pakistan entered into a public-private partnership with Indus Hospital &amp; Health Network (IHHN). Under this partnership, the GoS undertook sample collection and Indus Hospital in Karachi, Sindh, centralized testing. We describe the implementation strategies adopted by the partnership, as well as the challenges, opportunities, and lessons learned. Notably, up to 40% and 22% of total COVID-19 PCRs done in Sindh in the first 2 months of the pandemic, respectively, were performed at Indus Hospital in Karachi, though this percentage declined gradually as other centers caught up with their testing capacities. The rapid scaling up was achieved through a combination of mechanisms and factors including building on preexisting partnerships between the GoS and IHHN, pooling resources and harnessing distinct and complementary roles, relocating existing resources, introducing automation and information technology system changes, establishing risk mitigation strategies, and introducing quality measures within testing processes. The primary outcome of the partnership was rapid province-wide access to quality COVID-19 PCR testing with short turnaround times and at no cost to the patient. Furthermore, implementation of the partnership goals established new mechanisms as well as strengthened existing ones to enable rapid response to the future global health security challenges in Sindh, Pakistan.","38":"As the respectful maternity care agenda expands, it is necessary to understand what the priorities are for improving respectful, dignified, and high-quality care for newborns. To catalyze and inform a developing research field, we undertook a prioritization exercise to identify global research questions. We used a modified Delphi process to identify potential research priorities for understanding and addressing respectful care for newborns. Based on a literature review and expert discussions, we sent an open-ended questionnaire to participants in Round 1. The results were consolidated and used to create the Round 2 questionnaire, which asked participants to rank the preliminary list of research questions in 3 categories (descriptive, implementation, and measurement). Responses were weighted by rank and collated to generate a prioritized, consensus-based list of research questions. Round 1 resulted in 70 research questions from 25 respondents, and 52 participants completed the Round 2 ranked survey. Most participants identified themselves as researchers (53.2%), program designers, implementers, or evaluators (56.5%). More than half of the participants reported working primarily in low-income countries (66%). Top descriptive questions were on understanding manifestations and definitions of disrespectful care among newborns and which perceptions and beliefs held by health workers affect the quality of care provided. Top implementation questions were around how to promote respectful care as a standard, challenges faced by health facilities, and identification of effective advocacy strategies. Top measurement questions were on quantitative and qualitative metrics and the impact of experiences on health outcomes. This study developed, for the first time, a prioritized list of research questions focusing exclusively on respectful care for newborns. The study highlighted the absence of agreed-upon terminology and tools needed to advance both theoretical and practical efforts. This list should guide researchers and other stakeholders in developing further research. ","39":"In sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), chronic viral hepatitis B (HBV) affects more than 60 million people. Mother-to-child transmission is a major contributor to the ongoing HBV epidemic and yet only 11 of 54 (20.3%) SSA countries have introduced the birth dose of HBV vaccine (HepB-BD) into their regular immunization schedule. As more African countries adopt HepB-BD, implementation approaches must be targeted to ensure effective and timely HepB-BD delivery, especially in rural and under-resourced settings. We conducted a systematic literature review of published literature using PubMed. We included 39 articles published from January 2010 to August 2020, as well as gray literature, case studies, and research performed in SSA. We describe barriers to the uptake of HepB-BD in SSA at the policy, facility, and community levels and propose solutions that are relevant to stakeholders wishing to introduce HepB-BD. We highlight the importance and challenge of reaching infants who are born outside of health care facilities (i.e., home deliveries) with HepB-BD in partnership with community health workers. We also discuss the critical role of maternal education and community engagement in future HepB-BD scale-up efforts in SSA.","40":"In many low- and middle-income countries, planning cycles and policy decisions are not always informed by cost evidence, even where relevant and recent cost evidence is available. The Immunization Costing Action Network (ICAN) project was a research and learning community designed to strengthen country capacity to generate immunization cost evidence and to understand and improve the evidence-to-policy linkages for the evidence. We identified key factors that increase the likelihood that health policy makers will use evidence for policy making or planning, which shaped the development of a 6-step evidence to policy and practice (EPP) facilitated process. ICAN used the EPP process in Indonesia, Tanzania, and Vietnam from 2016-2019. The experience resulted in several insights regarding country priorities related to cost evidence and factors that determine uptake. Cost evidence is more likely to be used if it answers a specific policy question prioritized by the immunization program, while the use case is less clear and urgent for routine planning and program management. Nonhealth ministries and subnational stakeholders can provide important perspectives to inform the research and its usability. The use case for evidence should be revisited periodically as divergences from formal planning cycles are common and new policy windows open. Ensuring evidence is available at the right time is critical, even if this requires a sacrifice between rigor and speed. Engaging a small group of stakeholders, rather than an individual, to champion the research may be more effective, and the research has greater legitimacy if it is produced by multidisciplinary country teams. Evidence and messages should be tailored for and packaged targeting different audiences. Going forward, continued support is necessary to bridge the divide between those who generate cost evidence and those who translate evidence for policy and planning decisions.","41":"There is limited understanding of the potential impact of information sources on vaccination attitudes and behaviors in low-income countries. We examined how exposure to immunization information sources may be associated with vaccination uptake in Sierra Leone. In 2019, a household survey was conducted using multistage cluster sampling to randomly select 621 caregivers of children aged 12-23 months in 4 districts in Sierra Leone. We measured exposure to various sources of immunization information and 2 outcomes: (1) vaccination confidence using an aggregate score (from 12 Likert items, informed by previously validated scale) that was dichotomized into a binary variable; (2) uptake of the third dose of diphtheria-pertussis-tetanus-hepatitis B-Haemophilus influenzae type-b-pentavalent vaccine (penta-3) based on card record or through caregiver recall when card was unavailable. Associations between information sources and the outcomes were examined using modified Poisson regression with robust variance estimator. Weighted estimate for penta-3 uptake was 81% (75.2%-85.5%). The likelihood of uptake of penta-3 was significantly greater when caregiver received information from health facilities (adjusted prevalence ratio [aPR]=1.26, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.1, 1.5), faith leaders (aPR=1.16, 95% CI=1.1, 1.3), and community health workers (aPR=1.13, 95% CI=1.003, 1.3). Exposure to greater number of information sources was associated with high penta-3 uptake (aPR=1.05, 95% CI=1.02, 1.1). Immunization information received during health facility visits and through engagement with religious leaders may enhance vaccination uptake. Assessments to understand context-specific information dynamics should be prioritized in optimizing immunization outcomes. ","42":"To prevent malaria among children aged 3-59 months in areas with high seasonal transmission, seasonal malaria chemoprevention (SMC) is recommended. In Chad, there is evidence of SMC administration to children aged older than 5 years (referred to as \"leakage\"). This study aimed to understand the reasons for leakage and explore the feasibility and acceptability of extending the delivery of SMC to children aged 5-10 years in Chad. We conducted a mixed-methods study in Massaguet health district with a cross-sectional survey to determine SMC coverage for children aged up to 10 years after SMC cycles 1 and 3 (n=90 and n=100 caregivers surveyed, respectively) and at the end of cycle 4 (n=101 caregivers surveyed). We conducted 14 key informant interviews at the national and district level and 8 focus group discussions with community distributors and caregivers. In the compounds surveyed, there were no children aged 5-10 years in cycle 1. In cycles 3 (n=1 children) and 4 (n=16 children), there was 100% (95% confidence interval [CI]=2.5, 100.0) and 62.5% (95% CI=35.4, 84.8) coverage of SMC in children aged 5-10 years, respectively. Extension of SMC to older children was considered acceptable, but there were concerns about feasibility and ensuring the sustainability of the current program in children aged 3-59 months. Key informants acknowledged the need to secure additional funding to pilot SMC in older age groups and were uncertain about the impact of the current SMC program at scale. Key informants considered extending SMC to children aged 5-10 years acceptable but did not deem it a current priority. They expressed an urgent need to address leakage and reinforce both the sustainability and quality of the current SMC program. ","43":"Implementing and evaluating interventions in humanitarian settings in low- and middle-income countries presents unique challenges that are little addressed in the implementation literature. We document the process of developing, implementing, and evaluating the Amenah pilot intervention that aimed to mitigate the drivers of early marriage in a Syrian refugee community in Lebanon. Adolescent girls' vulnerability to early marriage increases following displacement due to poverty, insecurity, and school disruptions. We delineate how, as a local research team, we triangulated evidence from the international literature and formative community research to make informed decisions during the intervention's design and implementation phases. The pilot was delivered to 203 Syrian refugee schoolgirls aged 11-14 years during the 2017-2018 academic year. It consisted of 16 structured, interactive sessions with girls and a set of facilitated meetings with the girls' mothers, both of which were implemented by trained female community workers from the Syrian refugee community. Process evaluation results showed that sociodemographic factors predicted attendance among mothers, but relationships with peers in the intervention were the only significant predictor of attendance among girls. The primary outcomes of the pilot were attitudinal measures related to education and marriage. Attitudes toward education were highly positive at baseline and did not change over the course of the intervention. There were no significant changes in girls' ideal age at marriage. Among girls aged 13 and older at endline, the mean self-reported expected age at marriage increased slightly from 20.2 to 20.8 years (P&lt;.05). Our results also suggest that girls may adjust their expected age at marriage downward as they become older and if they drop out of school. We reflect in the discussion on some of the challenges encountered and lessons learned for the benefit of researchers intending to conduct community-based interventions in displacement settings.","44":"In 1986, the Philippines was one of the first countries to pass national legislation on the International Code of Marketing of Breastmilk Substitutes in the form of Executive Order (EO) 51 and Republic Act (RA) 10028. While violations against the legislation and corresponding sanctions are clearly defined, infractions remain unreported or go unpunished. Enforcement of the laws remains a significant challenge as government capacities suffer from inadequate resources to regularly monitor breastfeeding-related law violations. To address these gaps, The Department of Health (Philippines) and the World Vision Development Foundation developed a reporting platform to enable citizen reporting of EO 51 and RA 10028 violations as part of the Mother-Baby Friendly Philippines (MBFP) initiative. Upon completion of the project, the Alliance for Improving Health Outcomes Inc. conducted 68 surveys and 24 key informant interviews and focus group discussions with individuals who participated in trainings on EO 51 and RA 10028, community health workers, representatives of local government units and hospitals involved in breastfeeding programs, and city health officials to document benefits, challenges, and lessons learned. The intention and interest of consulted stakeholders to uphold the law by reporting violations through the platform indicate that citizen reporting can be harnessed as an effective tool for reporting violations. Nevertheless, multiple challenges remain in reporting and following up on Code violations. The platform provided citizens with an opportunity to report violations, but, in reality, the status of action and feedback did not change. There is a need to strengthen implementation and enforcement at all levels of relevant national government agencies and improve feedback loops on reported violations. ","45":"There is currently a severe paucity of rural epidemiologic data on urogenital schistosomiasis in the Republic of Chad in north-central Africa that is hindering national control strategies. Our study describes a mobile medical team's 4-year effort to collect data and provide mass therapeutic and preventive chemotherapy in the Salamat Region of Chad, a previously uninvestigated rural area. To overcome severe limitations in time, resources, support, and infrastructure, the team employed several time- and cost-saving techniques that included: (1) traveling by request and referral to utilize local knowledge to find the areas of highest need, (2) conducting convenience sampling for screening, (3) using simple but validated tools to expedite treatment and data gathering, and (4) working within cultural contexts to find and treat the most school-age children possible. The team managed a total of 11,832 patient encounters and found a 55% rate of hematuria (n=6,495) among school-age children, roughly double previous estimates. Rates of hematuria were higher in males (61%, n=3,955\/6,466) than females (48%, n=2,301\/4,806) and among adolescents (&gt; 65% in all age groups aged 10 years and older). These methods outline an efficient and effective strategy implemented under real-world conditions to enact therapeutic and preventive chemotherapy campaigns in resource-limited settings by engaging village leadership and developing locally driven solutions. Our data highlight the need for continued local epidemiologic efforts to treat the substantial number of children severely affected with schistosomiasis.","46":"Evidence-based programs are needed to engage men and boys that encourage the transformation of concepts of masculinity that uphold patterns of intimate partner violence (IPV). This study explores the constructs of masculinity and male gender norms surrounding sexual attitudes and IPV among men and boys living in Rakai, Uganda. Between April and August 2017, we conducted 38 interviews and 5 focus group discussions with men and boys aged 15 to 49 years and 4 focus groups with key stakeholders to understand how male use of violence is influenced by personal, community, and society-level concepts of masculinity. We adapted 2 constructs of masculinities, reputation and respectability, in the analysis to examine masculinities in relation to IPV in the rural Ugandan setting. Findings suggest men and boys upheld 2 types of masculinities: respectability versus reputation. Masculine attributes related to respectability (referred to as \"responsible men\") included having a job, house, wife, and many children and taking care of family. Masculine attributes related to reputation (referred to as \"cool men\") included having sexual prowess, multiple sexual partners, and the resources to buy nice things. Both masculine norms were used to justify dominance over women and IPV. The divergence of masculinity was observed among youth and young adults who participated in a gender-transformative program, suggesting the effectiveness of the program. The gender-transformative approach should provide men and boys a chance to reflect on dynamic, often conflicting, images of a man and should empower individuals to renegotiate and reconceptualize masculine norms. This critical reflection on masculinity, which resonates with men and boys, needs to be included when engaging men within HIV and IPV prevention programs. ","47":"The recent increase in the use of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) will result in an equal increase in the need for removals. Few countries monitor the number of LARC removals and even fewer track reasons for removal, discontinuation, and method switching. We conducted a mixed-method study to pilot the introduction of 5 LARC removal indicators in Mozambique: (1) reason for seeking removal, (2) duration of use, (3) removal outcome, (4) reason for referral, and (5) family planning (FP) outcome. We assessed providers' perceptions about the feasibility and utility of tracking these indicators and reviewed the findings to ascertain the quality-of-care concerns. We used a purposive, multistage sampling technique to select 19 intervention facilities in Nampula and Sofala provinces. Over 6 months, we abstracted data on the 5 indicators from an FP register addendum to determine when and why clients seek LARC removals and identify service quality issues that need to be addressed in the FP program. We used a supportive supervision checklist to assess the time taken to record data on the indicators and perceived benefits and challenges encountered by providers during record keeping. Of the 795 clients who sought a LARC removal, 112 women (14.1%) opted not to have the removal after counseling. The most frequently reported reasons for seeking a removal were: the method was on-schedule for removal or past its expiration date (29.5%), complaints of side effects (25.8%), and desire to be pregnant (22.9%). Health care providers reported no major challenges in recording information in the addendum. Reasons for and timing of removal pointed to the need for strengthening FP counseling. Collecting, synthesizing, and interpreting data from the LARC removal indicators was feasible and provided valuable insights to improve the quality of care to enhance clients' reproductive health care and contraceptive choices. ","48":"In recent years, community-based management of acute malnutrition (CMAM) has revolutionized the care for children by increasing treatment coverage. Critical to the success of CMAM is early case identification. Mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) measurement is a widely used, practical anthropometric measure used at the community level for the identification and admission of cases to appropriate treatment services. Globally, many organizations and government services use MUAC tapes for early case detection. However, there is no one universal MUAC tape specification, and it has been observed that using different MUAC tapes results in different measurements. In this article, we aim to: (1) present the measurement discrepancies; (2) discuss design specifications and their effect on case identification and admissions; (3) present a call to action to agree on common design specifications and standardized reporting. We hope this article will catalyze discussion and practical actions among nutrition and health stakeholders to ensure we have common MUAC tape design specifications so that all eligible at-risk children will get an equal chance to be identified early for critical treatment.","49":"Maternal and newborn health (MNH) service delivery redesign aims to improve maternal and newborn survival by shifting deliveries from poorly equipped primary care facilities to adequately prepared designated delivery hospitals. We assess the feasibility of such a model in Kakamega County, Kenya, by determining the capacity of hospitals to provide services under the redesigned model and the acceptability of the concept to providers and users. We find many existing system assets to implement redesign, including political will to improve MNH outcomes, a strong base of support among providers and users, and a good geographic spread of facilities to support implementation. There are nonetheless health workforce gaps, infrastructure deficits, and transportation challenges that would need to be addressed ahead of policy rollout. Implementing MNH redesign would require careful planning to limit unintended consequences and rigorous evaluation to assess impact and inform scale-up.","50":"Effective digital health management information systems (HMIS) support health data validity, which enables health care teams to make programmatic decisions and country-level decision making in support of international development targets. In 2015, mental health was included within the Sustainable Development Goals, yet there are few applications of HMIS of any type in the practice of mental health care in resource-limited settings. Zanmi Lasante (ZL), one of the largest providers of mental health care in Haiti, developed a digital data collection system for mental health across 11 public rural health facilities. We describe the development, implementation, and evaluation of the digital system for mental health data collection at ZL. To evaluate system reliability, we assessed the number of missing monthly reports. To evaluate data validity, we calculated concordance between the digital system and paper charts at 2 facilities. To evaluate the system's ability to inform decision making, we specified and then calculated 4 priority indicators. The digital system was missing 5 of 143 monthly reports across all facilities and had 74.3% (55\/74) and 98% (49\/50) concordance with paper charts. It was possible to calculate all 4 indicators, which led to programmatic changes in 2 cases. In response to implementation challenges, it was necessary to use strategies to increase provider buy-in and ultimately to introduce dedicated data clerks to keep pace with data collection and protect time for clinical work. While demonstrating the potential of collecting mental health data digitally in a low-resource rural setting, we found that it was necessary to consider the ongoing roles of paper records alongside digital data collection. We also identified the challenge of balancing clinical and data collection responsibilities among a limited staff. Ongoing work is needed to develop truly sustainable and scalable models for mental health data collection in resource-limited settings. ","51":"Faced with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic, governments worldwide instituted lockdowns to curtail virus spread. Health facility closures and travel restrictions disrupted access to antiretroviral (ARV) therapy for people living with HIV. This report describes how HIV programs in Indonesia, Laos, Nepal, and Nigeria supported treatment continuation by introducing home delivery of ARVs. Staff supporting the programs provided accounts of when and how decisions were taken to support ARV home delivery. They captured programmatic information about home delivery implementation using an intervention documentation tool. The 4 country experiences revealed lessons learned about factors favoring successful expansion of ARV home delivery. Three of the countries relied on existing networks of community health workers for ARV delivery; the fourth country, Indonesia, relied on a private sector courier service. Across the 4 countries, between 19% and 51% of eligible clients were served by home delivery. The experiences showed that ARV home delivery is feasible and acceptable to health service providers, clients, and other stakeholders. Essential to success was rapid mobilization of stakeholders who led the design of the home delivery mechanisms and provided leadership support of the service innovations. Timely service adaptation was made possible by pre-existing differentiated models of care supportive of community-based ARV provision by outreach workers. Home delivery models prioritized protection of client confidentiality and prevention measures for COVID-19. Sustainability of the innovation depends on reinforcement of the commodity management infrastructure and investment in financing mechanisms. Home delivery of ARVs is a feasible client-centered approach to be included among the options for decentralized drug distribution. It serves as a measure for expanding access to care both when access to health services is disrupted and under routine circumstances. ","52":"Over the past 5 years, substantial global investment has resulted in reduced TB incidence rates by 9% and mortality rates by 14%. However, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic has hindered access and availability of TB services to maintain robust TB control. The objective of this rapid review was to describe the challenges to be addressed and recommendations to strengthen health system preparedness for optimal TB control across low- and middle-income countries during and after the COVID-19 pandemic. Five databases were used to systematically search for relevant articles published in 2020. The 5-step framework proposed by Arskey and O'Malley and adapted by Levac et al. guided the review process. Thematic analysis with grounded theory principles was used to summarize themes from selected articles and integrate analyses with barriers reported from authors' previous TB research. Of the 218 peer-reviewed articles, 20 articles met the inclusion criteria. Four emerging themes described challenges: (1) unprepared health system leadership and infrastructure, (2) coexisting health priorities, (3) insufficient health care workforce support for continued training and appropriate workplace environments, and (4) weak connections to primary health centers hindering community engagement. Four recommendations were highlighted: (1) ensuring leadership and governance for sustainable national health budgets, (2) building networks of community stakeholders, (3) supporting health care workforce training and safe workplace environments, and (4) using digital health interventions for TB care. National health systems must promote patient-centered TB care, implement ethical community interventions, support operational research, and integrate appropriate eHealth applications. TB program managers and primary care practitioners can serve as instrumental leaders and patient advocates to deliver high-quality and sustainable TB care that leads to achieving the targets of the End TB Strategy. ","53":"Despite considerable investment and effort, unmet need for contraception remains an obstacle to improved family planning outcomes. One influencing factor is the frequency of contraceptive discontinuation among users who desire to prevent pregnancy, often due to method-related concerns and side effects. Contraceptive users have the right to be supported during counseling to voluntarily choose methods that align with their individual needs and preferences. Contraceptive counseling, as a key component of quality of care, is particularly important for providers to reduce unmet need among their clients. This scoping review examined the state of the evidence on contraceptive counseling and its impact on discontinuation. The review first examines the association between quality of care and contraceptive discontinuation, then looks to what the current body of evidence suggests are women's contraceptive counseling priorities, and lastly, explores whether specific counseling tools and approaches have been evaluated with discontinuation as an outcome. The results identified general principles and priorities for good counseling including person-centeredness, client-tailored information exchange, clear and concise information on side effects and bleeding changes, reducing providers' implicit and explicit biases, and trust and respect between the client and provider. The review of the literature also found that evidence to support the use of specific counseling tools and approaches to reduce contraceptive discontinuation is insufficient; research should be designed to determine which specific elements of the client-provider interaction can be improved to significantly impact contraceptive discontinuation. This evidence could inform how the global community of practice might improve and leverage specific counseling approaches and tools to address the most common predictors of discontinuation.","54":"In 2015, the Zambian government and the Swedish International Development Cooperation Agency (Sida) signed an agreement in which Sida committed to funding a program for Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, Adolescent Health and Nutrition (RMNCAH). The program includes a results-based financing (RBF) model that aims to reward Zambian districts for improved district-wide results on relevant indicators with additional funding. We aimed to describe stakeholders' knowledge of the RBF model and perceptions of the incentive structure during the first 18 months of the program's implementation. This study illuminates the possible pitfalls of implementing an RBF scheme without giving attention to all necessary steps of the process. A qualitative case study was used and included a review of documents, in-depth interviews, and observations. From February-April 2017, we conducted 37 in-depth interviews, representing the views of 12 development partner agencies, government departments, and health facility staff throughout Zambia. We used a qualitative framework analysis. Findings show that the Zambian government and Sida had different perceptions on what levels of the health system RBF will incentivize and that most districts and hospital administrators interviewed were unaware of the indicators that the RBF was part of the RMNCAH program at all. The lack of knowledge about the RBF scheme among respondents suggests the possibility that the model did not ultimately have the necessary preconditions to create an effective incentive structure. These results demonstrate the need for improved communication between stakeholders and the importance of sufficiently planning an RBF model before implementation.","55":"The current nutrition situation in Malawi, characterized by high rates of malnutrition in communities and hospitals and a rapidly increasing burden of overweight\/obesity and diet-related noncommunicable diseases, highlights the urgent need for registered dietitians, who have a proven track record in the prevention and management of all forms of malnutrition and improving patient outcomes. However, dietetics practice has been described as underdeveloped and fragmented in many parts of Africa, exacerbated by a severe and chronic shortage of dietetics professionals and a lack of nutrition and dietetic education programs in most African countries.We share early lessons learned in the development and implementation of the first dietetics program in Malawi. Within 6 years, the program produced 10 graduate dietitians who have filled the first clinical dietitian posts in Malawian public hospitals. This early success can be attributed to the model used to develop and implement the program, which included early stakeholder engagement to define the priority skills and competencies of a Malawian dietitian, the use of internationally recognized training standards, and the development of strategic institutional partnerships that brought together complementary skills and expertise. Furthermore, using existing resources and recruiting students with a nutrition and health background accelerated implementation. The current dietetics curriculum responds to the national nutrition and health policy direction and strategic objectives. Early and sustained government engagement was crucial in creating demand and securing career prospects for graduates. Although still in its infancy, dietitians in Malawi are poised to contribute significantly to alleviating the country's complex nutrition challenges.","56":"The provinces of North and South Kivu in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) have experienced insecurity since the 1990s. Without any solution to the conflict in sight, health actors have adapted their interventions to maintain some level of health service provision. We reflect on the health system resilience in the Kivu provinces in response to chronic levels of insecurity. Using qualitative interviews of health care providers from local government, United Nations agencies, and international nongovernmental organizations, we identify the mediating factors through which insecurity affects both service quality and delivery and investigate the strategies adopted to sustain service provision.Three main drivers linking insecurity and health service quality and delivery emerged: via violence, mobility restrictions, and resources availability. The effect of these drivers is mediated by several system or individual-level factors. Two factors were reported in each pathway: health care workforce availability and drug\/equipment accessibility. Human resources were affected differently by each driver: in terms of willingness to be stationed in a certain area (violence), capacity to access the health facility (mobility), and sustainability and motivation of conducting duties (resources). Similarly, the presence of drugs\/equipment varied in case of looting or damages (violence), delays in delivery (mobility), or delays in procurement (resources). While these mediators are not surprising, their identification allows the design of appropriate response strategies. The majority of the reported solutions attempt to address the lack of human resources and reflect absorptive capacity. Adaptive capacity characterizes the attempts to address lack of access (contingency plan, mobile clinics, maternity waiting homes, and security drugs). Finally, interventions to address insecurity can be classified as transformative. Health actors in eastern DRC have shown some capacity to adapt, adjust, and transform due to insecurity. Further research is needed to measure the effectiveness of such strategies to provide guidance to increasingly vulnerable health systems.","57":"While primary data on the unmet need for surgery in low- and middle-income countries is lacking, household surveys could provide an entry point to collect such data. We describe the first development and inclusion of questions on surgery in a nationally representative Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in Zambia. Questions regarding surgical conditions were developed through an iterative consultative process and integrated into the rollout of the DHS survey in Zambia in 2018 and administered to a nationwide sample survey of eligible women aged 15-49 years and men aged 15-59 years. In total, 7 questions covering 4 themes of service delivery, diagnosed burden of surgical disease, access to care, and quality of care were added. The questions were administered across 12,831 households (13,683 women aged 15-49 years and 12,132 men aged 15-59 years). Results showed that approximately 5% of women and 2% of men had undergone an operation in the past 5 years. Among women, cesarean delivery was the most common surgery; circumcision was the most common procedure among men. In the past 5 years, an estimated 0.61% of the population had been told by a health care worker that they might need surgery, and of this group, 35% had undergone the relevant procedure. For the first time, questions on surgery have been included in a nationwide DHS. We have shown that it is feasible to integrate these questions into a large-scale survey to provide insight into surgical needs at a national level. Based on the DHS design and implementation mechanisms, a country interested in including a set of questions like the one included in Zambia, could replicate this data collection in other settings, which provides an opportunity for systematic collection of comparable surgical data, a vital role in surgical health care system strengthening. ","58":"We aimed to test the effects of pharmacist intervention on the community control of hypertension through a comparative randomized controlled trial. We recruited adult hypertensive patients with comorbidity or confusion with medication (n=636) from 2 community health centers in Zunyi, China. They were randomly and equally divided into 2 groups. Both groups received the usual care and participated in the community systematic management program of hypertension. Participants in the intervention group were given interventions from pharmacists, including a monthly review of medications, patient education, and medication adjustment advice to medical doctors over 6 months. Participants' blood pressure was assessed at baseline, 3 months, and 6 months. Participants' knowledge and medication adherence were measured using a questionnaire before and after the trial. Compared to the control group (n=298), a significantly higher percentage of participants in the intervention group (n=290) had their blood pressure under control 3 months (46.9% vs. 38.3%, P=.034) and 6 months (60.7% vs. 40.9%, P&lt;.001) after the interventions. Difference-in-differences analyses showed that the pharmacist intervention resulted in an increase in knowledge scores by 12.55 points (P&lt;.001), a decrease in systolic blood pressure by 6.65 mmHg (P=.001), and a decrease in diastolic blood pressure by 7.26 mmHg (P&lt;.001) compared to the controls after adjustment for variations in potential confounding factors. The odds of participants passing the hypertension knowledge tests in the intervention group was 4.45 times those in the control group (P&lt;.001). Similarly, it was found that the intervention group had higher odds of not needing any medication adjustments (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]=2.75, P&lt;.001) and having their blood pressure under control (AOR=2.18, P=.002) compared to the control group. It is evident that pharmacist intervention has significant short-term effects on improving the knowledge and medication adherence of hypertensive patients, as well as timely medication adjustments from medical doctors, resulting in lowered blood pressure and an increased control rate. Further studies should explore the long-term sustainability of the effects of community pharmacist intervention.

Household survey data are generally regarded as \"gold standard,\" high-quality data. This study assessed the comparability of intervention coverage time trends from routine and survey data at national and subnational levels in Mali. We compared 3 coverage indicators: contraceptive prevalence rate, institutional delivery, and 3 doses of diphtheria, pertussis, and tetanus (DPT3) vaccine, using 3 Mali Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS 2001, 2006, and 2012-2013) and routine health system data covering 2001-2012. For routine data, we used local health information system (HIS) annual reports and an HIS database. To compare time trends between the data sources, we calculated the percentage point change and 95% confidence interval from 2001-2006 and 2006-2012. We then computed the absolute and relative differences between the 2 data sources for each indicator over time at national and regional levels and assessed their level of significance. The direction and magnitude of the time trends of contraceptive prevalence rate, institutional delivery, and DPT3 vaccine from 2001 to 2012 were similar at the national level between data sources. At the regional level, there were significant differences in the magnitude and direction of time trends for institutional delivery and the DPT3 vaccine; contraceptive prevalence trends were more consistent. Routine data tended to overestimate DPT3 coverage, and underestimate institutional delivery and contraceptive prevalence relative to survey data. Routine data in Mali-particularly at the national level-appear to be appropriate for use to inform program planning and prioritization, but routine time trends should be interpreted with caution at the subnational level. For program evaluations, routine data may not be appropriate to draw accurate inferences about program impact. ","61":"Community health worker (CHW) programs in Uganda have contributed to improved health outcomes in recent years. However, opportunities for engaging the various stakeholders supporting CHW programs have been limited. This article presents workshop findings where several stakeholders shared their lessons and experiences that can enhance performance and sustainability of CHW programs in Uganda. We collected qualitative data from stakeholders from government, private, and community organizations, as well as CHWs, involved in CHW programs in Uganda during a 1-day workshop. The workshop involved plenary presentations and group discussions on critical aspects of CHW programs. All proceedings from the workshop were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed by thematic content analysis. Four major themes emerged from the workshop: lessons learned in implementing CHW programs, challenges affecting CHW programs, performance of CHWs, and ensuring sustainability of CHW programs. Key lessons learned related to 3 main subthemes: capacity building and use of technology, supervision and motivation, and stakeholder engagement and collaboration. Challenges affecting CHW programs identified included poor coordination, fragmented data collection systems, high program expectations, inadequate support mechanisms, and high dropout rates. Mechanisms for improving the performance of CHWs emphasized the need to: strengthen recruitment, training, and retention strategies; improve motivation; streamline coordination mechanisms; and develop and strengthen community health policies. The sustainability of CHW programs requires institutionalization; sustainable funding; economic empowerment of CHWs; local ownership; and a strengthened research agenda. To improve the performance and sustainability of CHWs programs, stakeholders such as policy makers and implementing partners need to consider CHW needs, existing structures and policies, as well as local support. ","62":"Eleven anti-TB drugs were included in the Government of India's Schedule H1 drug regulations in 2014. The National Strategic Plan for TB Elimination in India 2017-2025 recognized the opportunity to strengthen the TB surveillance system and improve the quality of TB care by implementing the Schedule H1 regulation. However, there were no documented systematic large-scale efforts to use Schedule H1 regulation to support TB surveillance or improve the quality of care. We aimed to document the process of implementation of the Schedule H1 regulation to enhance the quality of TB care and strengthen the TB surveillance system in Kerala, India. We conducted 33 in-depth interviews of the drugs control department enforcement officers, chemist shop owners, private-sector doctors, leaders of professional medical associations, and program managers and key staff of the TB Elimination Program in Kerala. Major themes identified were the process of implementation of Schedule H1 and how the National TB Elimination Program used the information. Findings from the qualitative interviews were corroborated with the quantitative information from the annual program performance reports and anti-TB drug sales data. The TB Elimination Program of Kerala used the information from the Schedule H1 drug register to identify the missing TB cases and strengthen TB notification, identify providers for engagement and extend support to them for ensuring standards of TB care, and provide feedback to providers regarding prescription practices. Stakeholders felt that implementation of Schedule H1 surveillance has helped to improve TB patient notifications from the private sector, build better public-private partnerships, and improve the quality of TB diagnosis and treatment in Kerala. Pharmacy-based drug sales data collected either through regulatory or non-regulatory methods have immense potential to support TB elimination programs. ","63":"Food fortification is a powerful strategy to reach large populations with multiple micronutrients added to a single food vehicle. The impact depends on the sustained provision and utilization of adequately fortified food by a large population (mainly in low-income and food-insecure settings). We apply a value chain (VC) analysis framework to diagnose and address the barriers to the uptake of encapsulated ferrous fumarate double fortified salt (DFS) distributed through public-sector-led DFS interventions in India.We adapt the VC requirements framework proposed by Henson and Humphrey to identify and categorize barriers along the DFS VC as technological, market-related, and policy-related. We conducted a desk review of published and unpublished literature on DFS and information available in the public domain, semi-structured interviews with VC stakeholders from the private sector, program data from implementing organizations, and participation in multistakeholder consultations on DFS.Major supply-side barriers were under-developed private markets, inconsistent demand from public markets, unpredictable returns-on-investments, and inadequate business incentives to invest in DFS. The product's weak consumer orientation, uncreated consumer demand, low awareness of fortified foods, inadequate nutrition signaling were significant demand-side barriers. Technological barriers related to the requirement of high-grade salt for DFS production and residual organoleptic property of mild discoloration of food. Policy barriers related to inadequate and irregular financing for distributing subsidized DFS through the public distribution system; insufficient policy support for risk-sharing and managing costs associated with fortification; and a weak institutional environment for sustaining DFS interventions.Building an enabling institutional environment, demand creation through consumer awareness, strengthening institutional markets through public financing, managing cost and risks through public-private partnerships, and assuring quality during commercial scale-up are critical interventions necessary to ensure impact at scale.","64":null,"65":"Recent increases in fertility rates in Egypt and an increase in desired fertility among unmarried young people highlight the need for renewed attention to awareness of and demand for family planning (FP) among young people. Between 2017 and 2018, the United States Agency for International Development-funded Evidence Project tested 2 intervention models to increase awareness of and demand for FP and reproductive health (RH) services among people aged 18-35 years in Souhag and Port Said governorates, Egypt. In Souhag, FP\/RH information was integrated into a 5-day livelihood training program for job seekers. In Port Said, garment factory workers received FP\/RH information through trained peer educators, social and behavior change materials, and social media. Workshop participants and factory workers interested in FP services were referred to private project-trained physicians and pharmacists. We present the results of an evaluation of the impact of each intervention on young people's reported exposure to FP messages and their FP knowledge, attitudes, and behaviors. Phone interviews were conducted with participants in intervention and comparison groups before and after the intervention. In Souhag, 1,519 intervention group participants (778 at baseline; 741 at endline) and 1,082 comparison group participants (699 at baseline; 383 at endline) completed the phone interview. In Port Said 1,958 participants from intervention factories (1,145 at baseline; 813 at endline) and 1,047 participants from comparison factories (621 at baseline; 426 at endline) completed the phone interview. A difference-in-differences analysis compared intervention and comparison groups between baseline and endline. Results showed significant differences in knowledge and attitudes over time between the intervention and comparison groups in Souhag but less so in Port Said. FP use did not change among project participants in either governorate. We discuss lessons learned from integrating FP into worker health and livelihood training programs and methodological considerations for evaluating such interventions.","66":"In 2011, the Ministry of Health in Malawi developed and institutionalized a resource-tracking process, known as resource mapping (RM), to collect information on planned funding flows across the health sector to support resource allocation and mobilization decisions. We analyze the RM process and tools and describe key uses of the data for health financing decision making to achieve universal health coverage (UHC). We applied a case study approach, written as a collaboration between policy makers who have led the RM process in Malawi and the implementation team who have developed tools, collected data, and reported results over the period. It draws on our experiences in conducting RM in Malawi to document the RM process and data, key uses of data, implementation challenges, and lessons learned. We conducted a gray literature review to understand rounds of RM in which we did not participate. Finally, we conducted a search of published literature to situate our work in the international health resource-tracking literature. The RM exercise in Malawi is iteratively designed around the needs of the end users and policy priorities of the government, which in turn drives institutionalization of the exercise. We describe 4 ways in which RM data has been used, including national and district planning and budgeting; prioritization and coordination of existing funds by estimating resource availability; mobilization of new resources by conducting financial gap analysis against costed national strategic plans; and generation of evidence to support the national response to the coronavirus disease 2019 pandemic. To achieve UHC goals in Malawi, RM has equipped the government and development partners with critical data used for resource mobilization and coordination decisions. Lessons learned from RM in Malawi may be applicable to other countries starting or refining their own health resource-tracking exercise. ","67":"We evaluated the impact of solar light installation in Ugandan maternity facilities on implementation processes, reliability of light, and quality of intrapartum care. We conducted a stepped-wedge cluster-randomized trial of the We Care Solar Suitcase, a complete solar electric system providing lighting and power for charging phones and small medical devices, in 30 rural Ugandan maternity facilities with unreliable lighting. Facilities were randomly assigned to receive the intervention in the first or second sequence in a 1:1 ratio. We collected data from June 2018 to April 2019. The intervention was installed in September 2018 (first sequence) and in December 2018 (second sequence). The primary effectiveness outcomes were a 20-item and a 36-item index of quality of intrapartum care, a 6-item index of delays in care provision, and the percentage of deliveries with bright light, satisfactory light, and adequate light. We observed 1,118 births across 30 facilities. The intervention was successfully installed in 100% of facilities. After installation, the intervention was used in 83% of nighttime deliveries. Before the intervention, providers on average performed 42% of essential care actions and accumulated 76 minutes of delays during nighttime deliveries. After installation, quality increased by 4 percentage points (95% confidence interval [CI]=1,8) and delays in care decreased by 10 minutes (95% CI=-16,-3), with the largest impacts on infection control, prevention of postpartum hemorrhage, and newborn care practices. One year after the end of the trial, 90% of facilities had LED lights in operation and 60% of facilities had all components in operation. Reliable light is an important driver of timely and adequate health care. Policy makers should invest in renewable energy systems for health facilities; however, even when reliable lighting is present, quality of care may remain low without a broader approach to quality improvements. ","68":"Bangladesh has a long history of mature and institutionalized community health worker (CHW) programs in primary health care. However, there is a lot of variability in the performance of the CHW programs in Bangladesh, as well as challenges associated with retention of CHWs. This study describes the challenges for CHWs, which in turn affect their motivation and performance. This study was conducted from December 2019 to January 2020 in 4 districts in Bangladesh: Cox's Bazar, Khulna, Rajshahi, and Sylhet. Twenty focus group discussions were conducted with 121 participants, including family welfare assistants (FWA), health assistants (HA), and their direct supervisors. Thirty in-depth interviews were conducted with upazila and district-level stakeholders. Data were analyzed using a thematic approach with a particular focus on CHW motivation, job satisfaction, and incentive preferences for improving morale and performance. Several nonmonetary and monetary factors affect CHWs' motivation, performance, and job satisfaction. Recognition by the community, availability of promotions and technical recognition, increased training opportunities, reduced workloads, identification as government employees, access to transportation, provision of working tools, and improvements in the workplace environment were identified as important nonmonetary incentives. CHWs also discussed the importance of sufficient salaries and allowances. Several factors impede the effectiveness of the CHW programs in Bangladesh. Changes to technical ranks and wages for the health care sector need to take a sector-wide lens to enable systematic calibration of wages for all health care workers. This study highlights that institutionalization of CHWs without adequate and sustained support for continued training, compensation, supervision, access to working tools, and recognition is insufficient to drive change. Identifying pragmatic strategies that can be supported through existing government budgets to address these factors is vital to sustaining the community health workforce in Bangladesh. ","69":"Child stunting is a critical global health issue. Guatemala has one of the world's highest levels of stunting despite the sustained commitment to international nutrition policy best practices endorsed by the Scaling Up Nutrition (SUN) movement. Our objective was to use Guatemala as a case study to project the impact of a recently published national nutrition policy, the Great Crusade, that is consistent with SUN principles. We used the Lives Saved Tool (LiST) to project the impact of scaling-up of nutrition interventions proposed in the Great Crusade and recommended by SUN. Our outcomes were changes in stunting prevalence, number of stunting cases averted, and number of cases averted by intervention in children under 5 years of age from 2020 to 2030. We considered 4 scenarios: (1) intervention coverage continues based on historical trends, (2) coverage targets in the Great Crusade are achieved, (3) coverage targets in the Great Crusade are achieved with reduced fertility risk, and (4) coverage reaches an aspirational level. All scenarios led to modest reductions in stunting prevalence. In 2024, stunting prevalence was estimated to change by -0.1% (95% confidence interval [CI]= 0.0%,-0.2%) if historical trends continue, -1.1% (95% CI=-0.8%,-1.5%) in the Great Crusade scenario, and -2.2% (95% CI=-1.6%,-3.0%) in the aspirational scenario. In 2030, we projected a stunting prevalence of -0.4% (95% CI=-0.2%,-0.8%) and -3.7% (95% CI=-2.8%,-5.1%) in the historical trends and aspirational scenario, respectively. Complementary feeding, sanitation, and breastfeeding were the highest-impact interventions across models. Targeted reductions in child stunting prevalence in Guatemala are unlikely to be achieved solely based on increases in intervention coverage. Our results show the limitations of current paradigms recommended by the international nutrition community. Policies and strategies are needed to address the broader structural drivers of stunting. ","70":"Reliable measurement of newborn postnatal care is essential to understand gaps in coverage and quality and thereby improve outcomes. This study examined gaps in coverage and measurement of newborn postnatal care in the first 2 days of life. We analyzed Demographic and Health Survey data from 15 countries for 71,366 births to measure the gap between postnatal contact coverage and content coverage within 2 days of birth. Coverage was a contact with the health system in the first 2 days (postnatal check or newborn care intervention), and quality was defined as reported receipt of 5 health worker-provided interventions. We examined internal consistency between interrelated questions regarding examination of the umbilical cord. Reported coverage of postnatal check ranged from 13% in Ethiopia to 78% in Senegal. Report of specific newborn care interventions varied widely by intervention within and between countries. Quality-coverage gaps were high, ranging from 26% in Malawi to 89% in Burundi. We found some internally inconsistent reporting of newborn care. The percentage of women who reported that a health care provider checked their newborn's umbilical cord but responded \"no\" to the postnatal check question was as high as 16% in Malawi. Reliable measurement of coverage and content of early postnatal newborn care is essential to track progress in improving quality of care. Postnatal contact coverage is challenging to measure because it may be difficult for women to distinguish postnatal care from intrapartum care and it is a less recognizable concept than antenatal care. Co-coverage measures may provide a useful summary of contact and content, reflecting both coverage and an aspect of quality.

In global health, M&amp;E is considered essential to good practice, and evidence and data are critical tools in program design, performance monitoring, impact evaluation, and adaptation and learning. As HCD is increasingly integrated into global health practice, designers and global health practitioners are learning as they go how to integrate measurement into design and adapt traditional M&amp;E approaches to design-influenced global health projects. This article illustrates some of the tensions inherent in the way global health and HCD practitioners approach measurement, using several cases to illustrate the ways in which tensions can be managed. Using framing introduced by the MeasureD project, which aimed to audit measurement practices in HCD (called social design in the MeasureD project), we explore 3 recent examples of design-influenced global health interventions: 1 focusing on products, 1 on behavior change, and 1 on service improvement, to extract learning about how teams used measurement, for what purpose, and to what effect. In comparing these examples and recent experience, we report on the steps being taken toward greater alignment in the use of measurement to advance human-centered global health programming.","77":"Human-centered design (HCD) is increasingly being used as a complementary approach to traditional global health methods due to its ability to bring new ideas to entrenched problems, integrate multiple stakeholder perspectives, and bring in a strong human lens among other advantages. To reap these benefits, public health and design practitioners in global health programs can learn from the early experiences of integrating HCD to advance these efforts. This article distills lessons gathered from 3 programs leveraging HCD to advance global health programming: (1) the \"V\" program which used an HCD approach to reframe the once-a-day HIV prevention pill from a potentially stigmatizing medicine into empowering self-care; (2) the Adolescents 360 program which integrated HCD to create a service for adolescent girls to access contraception in Ethiopia and to scale this offering nationwide; and (3) Reimagining TA which used HCD to help shift perceptions around traditional technical assistance models to one of co-creation, defining a new approach for non-financial support for health systems strengthening. To inform global health programs that are considering employing an HCD approach, lessons learned are distilled into 3 categories: (1) planning: considerations for problem definition and project scoping to allow for flexibility and selection of appropriate methods; (2) engaging: reflections on the means to productively engage different stakeholder groups to build alignment, understanding, and buy-in; (3) applying: adoption of new ways of working during implementation to best take advantage of the benefits of HCD while promoting long-term program sustainability and learning. These lessons represent an important step on the pathway to demonstrate the contributions of HCD to improving the effectiveness of health programs at a time when the global health community needs the most robust set of tools possible to meet the demands of our current pandemic context and beyond. ","78":"A lack of access to evidence-based, unbiased, and youth-friendly family planning and reproductive health (FP\/RH) information and care limit young people's ability to prevent unplanned pregnancies and HIV and sexually transmitted infections. This threat-ens their health and is a significant cause of school drop-out, limiting young peoples' well-being, future potential, and employment opportunities. To address these challenges facing youth, YLabs used an end-to-end human-centered design (HCD) approach to create CyberRwanda, a digital platform aiming to improve the health and livelihoods of adolescents (aged 12-19 years) in Rwanda. From 2016 to 2020, CyberRwanda was designed and piloted using an HCD approach in partnership with more than 1,000 youth, parents, teachers, and public and private health care providers. During the problem recognition phase, HCD revealed participants' beliefs, behavioral preferences, and experiences as they relate to FP\/RH specifically and their broader life experiences, motivations, and challenges. Several phases of analog, digital, and live prototyping with youth and key stakeholders were used to codesign, test, and refine the intervention for implementation. CyberRwanda is a direct-to-consumer platform where adolescents can learn integrated, age-appropriate health, and skills-building information through edutainment behavior change stories and a robust frequently asked questions library, order health products online, and be linked to CyberRwanda's network of private and public health care providers who have been trained to provide adolescent-friendly care. The HCD process resulted in significant pivots to the design of the digital platform and the implementation model. Using HCD provided a structured methodology to combine technical FP\/RH expertise and visual and product design expertise to codesign and iteratively develop a digital health intervention with and for Rwandan youth. ","79":"Although HIV care is widely available in South Africa, men are less likely than women to know their HIV status, begin treatment upon diagnosis, and adhere to treatment. Men are also more likely to die from causes related to HIV compared to women. To overcome this inequity, tailored approaches designed with men's specific needs are required. As part of the Testing and Treatment for Men project, a 3-year multicomponent, mixed-methods study that aimed to better understand young South African men's needs concerning HIV testing and treatment, we used human-centered design (HCD) methods to identify, develop, and pilot test a male-friendly peer-support intervention. We engaged key stakeholders in the development of several prototype interventions to improve men's engagement across the HIV cascade, one of which was selected for further development. Use of HCD methods, informed by the results of our team's prior qualitative and quantitative research, led to the development of Coach Mpilo, a peer-support intervention to engage and retain men living with HIV in South Africa in care and treatment. By designing with empathy for the lived experiences of these men, our intervention achieved the authenticity and credibility required to build trusting relationships in the affected communities. Preliminary results of Coach Mpilo have demonstrated a high level of acceptability by men living with HIV as well as key government and other implementing partners. HCD as a critical ingredient became an integral and essential component in developing and field-testing the Coach Mpilo pilot. The key elements of our HCD approach that resulted in the successful generation of the Coach Mpilo pilot intervention and its implementation were understanding and addressing the specific issues identified by men living with HIV and leveraging newly created empathy with men as an approach to solving the issues collaboratively and innovatively. ","80":"The completeness and accuracy of data in the Nigerian health care system is a challenge. Studies have shown that the data quality, and by extension data integrity, has been suboptimal and thus poses a barrier to strengthening service delivery. This article showcases how the design process sparked the concept for an intervention to improve the integrity of public health data being collected in Nigeria.In collaboration with the Nigerian Institute of Medical Research (NIMR) and Lifebank, the Co-creation Hub team conducted formative research with the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) test center managers at NIMR. The insights informed the development of the features for an outbreak management system. These features were refined through an iterative process of development and continuous feedback from the end users.NIMR reported an improvement in its data collection process and data integrity. They reported that (1) almost all data collection by the test center was now automated, thereby minimizing the proportion of inaccurate and repeat entry in comparison to data collected in other parts of the same center; (2) the auto-validation feature of the system ensured that all required fields of a patient's information were completed and verified, thereby ensuring 100% data completeness; and (3) the validation and verification feature ensured that patients' contact information was validated.The integration of this intervention into the current health information system ensures an improvement in the accuracy and validity of health care data being collected and stored.","81":"","82":"The goal of this theory of change is to provide funders, implementing partners, and designers a tool to increase the understanding and application of human-centered design (HCD) as an approach that enhances global health programming. The theory of change also aims to communicate the potential for HCD to introduce new and disruptive mindsets, practices, and techniques to global health programming and to clarify HCD's potential value from the funding application process through to implementation.

Challenges associated with implementation are possible contributing factors preventing this innovative diagnostic technology from achieving more significant public health outcomes. This review aimed to assess the use of implementation science frameworks when reporting the enablers and barriers for the implementation of GeneXpert for diagnosing TB in LMICs. We conducted a qualitative systematic review of the peer-reviewed literature using PubMed, Medline, and Scopus. Eligible articles were those published between January 2010 and March 2020 that identified enablers and barriers to GeneXpert implementation, as well as the implementation approach delivered in an LMIC. Eleven studies were included in the review. Implementation barriers were found to be relatively consistent across studies and included patient-level factors, human resources, material resources, service implementation, service coordination, and technical operations. Few studies (n=5) identified enabling factors in the implementation of Xpert for TB testing. Identified enablers included strategies such as active case finding, expanding diagnostic algorithms, and daily transport of samples. The public health impact of Xpert TB testing interventions was commonly influenced by implementation barriers (n=4). Of the 11 studies, only 3 reported against an implementation framework. This review identified a commonality in implementation barriers and enablers that influenced the overall public health impact of GeneXpert. With greater transparency of these barriers and enablers, program planners can promote a more collaborative approach and adapt interventions. It is recommended that program planners use implementation science frameworks when conducting research and publishing. This will build an evidence base focused on implementation and thereby support programs to address implementation barriers and include enabling factors in program design. ","86":"Emergency medicine (EM) is rapidly being recognized as a specialty around the globe. This has particular promise for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) that experience the largest burden of disease for emergency conditions. Specialty education and training in EM remain essentially an apprenticeship model. Finding the required expertise to educate graduate learners can be challenging in regions where there are low densities of specialty providers.We describe an initiative to implement a sustainable, bidirectional partnership between the Emergency Medicine Departments of Weill Cornell Medicine (WCM) in New York, NY, USA, and Bugando Medical Center (BMC) in Mwanza, Tanzania. We used synchronous and asynchronous telecommunication technology to enhance an ongoing emergency medicine education collaboration.The Internet infrastructure for this collaboration was created by bolstering 4G services available in Mwanza, Tanzania. By maximizing the 4G signal, sufficient bandwidth could be created to allow for live 2-way audio\/video communication. Using synchronous and asynchronous applications such as Zoom and WhatsApp, providers at WCM and BMC can attend real-time didactic lectures, participate in discussion forums on clinical topics, and collaborate on the development of clinical protocols. Proof of concept exercises demonstrated that this system can be used for real-time mentoring in EKG interpretation and ultrasound technique, for example. This system was also used to share information and develop operations flows during the COVID-19 pandemic. The use of telecommunication technology and e-learning in a format that promotes long-term, sustainable interaction is practical and innovative, provides benefit to all partners, and should be considered as a mechanism by which global partnerships can assist with training in emergency medicine in LMICs.","87":"Lessons learned from one global health program can inform responses to challenges faced by other programs. One way to disseminate these lessons is through courses. However, such courses are often delivered by and taught to people based in high-income countries and thus may not present a truly global perspective. The Synthesis and Translation of Research and Innovations from Polio Eradication (STRIPE) is a consortium of 8 institutions in Afghanistan, Bangladesh, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, India, Indonesia, Nigeria, and the United States that seeks to carry out such a transfer of the lessons learned in polio eradication. This short report describes the collaborative process of developing content and curriculum for an international course, the learnings that emerged, the barriers we faced, and recommendations for future similar efforts. Various parts of our course were developed by teams of researchers from countries across South Asia and sub-Saharan Africa. We held a series of regional in-person team meetings hosted in different countries to improve rapport and provide a chance to work together in person. The course content reflects the diversity of team members' knowledge in a variety of contexts. Challenges to this effort included team coordination (e.g., scheduling across time zones); hierarchies across and between countries; and the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. We recommend planning for these hierarchies ahead of time and ensuring significant in-person meeting time to make the most of international collaboration.","88":"The Last Ten Kilometers 2020 Project (L10K 2020) designed a strategy for piloting, implementing, and scaling a mobile health (mHealth) digital solution to improve the quality of community-level maternal and child health service delivery in Ethiopia. L10K 2020 first conducted a landscape assessment to design a context-appropriate smartphone-based mHealth solution for the Health Extension Workers and tablets for their supervisors and the midwives managing the same clients at the health center level. These applications included multiple modules and packages including client registration and appointment management; follow-up and notifications; digital job aids for each of the maternal and child health program packages (for Health Extension Workers only); and referral and client tracking systems.Findings from the process evaluation of the mHealth app usage and user experience indicated that the application was user-friendly and facilitated real-time information exchange, defaulter tracing, referral, and feedback systems. It improved the timely identification and registration of pregnant mothers. Adherence to treatment protocols also increased in all domains across the pregnancy continuum of care.L10K 2020 has developed a user-friendly model for implementing mHealth solutions at the community level through stakeholder engagement across levels when developing, testing, and deploying the applications, which was critical to effectively cultivating ownership as well as skills and knowledge transfer at all levels. To replicate and scale this model, context-based scoping, resource analysis, and mapping are essential to determine the infrastructure, cost, time, risks, and key stakeholders involved throughout the implementation of the intervention. During implementation, vigilance in consistently mitigating the challenges related to mHealth infrastructure, such as mobile data capacity, electricity, smartphones and tablets, solar chargers, and internet connectivity, is critical for continued success.","89":"Rumors and misperceptions were a persistent challenge in the response to the 2014-2016 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in West Africa. This study aimed to document organizational approaches to identifying and addressing rumors and provide practical recommendations for future outbreaks. We conducted semistructured interviews with 34 individuals who participated in the EVD response in Liberia and\/or Sierra Leone. Interviews focused on the general organizational approach and organizational response to specific rumors. Interviews were recorded and transcribed verbatim. Most respondents reported that rumors were considered an organizational priority and their importance increased over time. Formal rumor identification systems using community-level reporters were described in Liberia and Sierra Leone as well as varied informal systems. A wide range of approaches was used to address rumors including Community Led Ebola Action, Community Led Total Sanitation, drama performances, Ebola Treatment Center\/Unit-based approaches, radio, leveraging community leaders as an information source, and organization change. Interpersonal and community-led approaches were described most often. Staff whose professional roles did not involve rumor management reported informally addressing rumors with colleagues and beneficiaries. Rumors reflecting valid concerns with the EVD response, such as potential infection in health care facilities, were addressed through organizational change and improvement. Interpersonal and community-led approaches were considered effective by participants and hold promise for future outbreaks. Informal systems developed at Ebola Treatment Centers\/Units highlighted how these facilities may be utilized as an information hub. Professionals who interact with beneficiaries, especially local staff, are likely to address rumors informally and organizations may benefit from considering local staff an asset in rumor management. Rumors alerted responders to issues in the EVD response, but this may not be the most efficient mechanism to receive and address concerns. ","90":"Animal source foods (ASFs), including cow's milk, contain essential nutrients and contribute to a healthy diet, but frequency of intake is low among children in low- and middle-income countries. We hypothesized that an ASF social and behavior change communication (SBCC) intervention implemented by community health workers (CHWs) would increase child milk consumption and dietary diversity in households that received a cow from the Government of Rwanda's Girinka livestock transfer program. We tested the 9-month SBCC intervention among children aged 12-29 months at baseline in administrative cells randomly assigned to the intervention or control. Most mothers in the intervention group were exposed to CHWs' home visits (90.7%) or community-level activities (82.8%). At endline, more mothers in the intervention group compared with the control group knew that cow's milk was an ASF (90.1% vs. 81.7%, P=.03) and could be introduced to children at 12 months (41.7% vs. 18.7%, P&lt;.001). More mothers in the intervention group compared with the control group knew they should feed their children ASFs (76.2% vs. 62.1%, P=.01) and give them 1 cup of cow's milk per day (20.6% vs. 7.8%, P&lt;.001). Children's consumption of fresh cow's milk 2 or more times per week increased in the intervention group, although not significantly (8.0 percentage points, P=.17); minimum dietary diversity was unchanged. Children in the intervention group had increased odds of consuming cow's milk 2 or more times per week if their mothers recalled hearing that children should drink 1 cup of cow's milk per day during a CHW's home visit [odds ratio (OR) 2.1, 95% confidence interval (CI) (1.1, 3.9)] or a community activity [OR 2.0, 95% CI (1.2, 3.5)]. Approximately half of the children had no milk during the past week because their households produced too little or sold what was produced. In poor households receiving a livestock transfer, strategies to further tailor SBCC and increase cow's milk production may be needed to achieve larger increases in children's frequency of milk consumption.","91":"Health sector priorities and interventions to prevent and manage noncommunicable diseases and injuries (NCDIs) in low- and lower-middle-income countries (LLMICs) have primarily adopted elements of the World Health Organization Global Action Plan for NCDs 2013-2020. However, there have been limited efforts in LLMICs to prioritize among conditions and health-sector interventions for NCDIs based on local epidemiology and contextually relevant risk factors or that incorporate the equitable distribution of health outcomes. The Lancet Commission on Reframing Noncommunicable Diseases and Injuries for the Poorest Billion supported national NCDI Poverty Commissions to define local NCDI epidemiology, determine an expanded set of priority NCDI conditions, and recommend cost-effective, equitable health-sector interventions. Fifteen national commissions and 1 state-level commission were established from 2016-2019. Six commissions completed the prioritization exercise and selected an average of 25 NCDI conditions; 15 conditions were selected by all commissions, including asthma, breast cancer, cervical cancer, diabetes mellitus type 1 and 2, epilepsy, hypertensive heart disease, intracerebral hemorrhage, ischemic heart disease, ischemic stroke, major depressive disorder, motor vehicle road injuries, rheumatic heart disease, sickle cell disorders, and subarachnoid hemorrhage. The commissions prioritized an average of 35 health-sector interventions based on cost-effectiveness, financial risk protection, and equity-enhancing rankings. The prioritized interventions were estimated to cost an additional US$4.70-US$13.70 per capita or approximately 9.7%-35.6% of current total health expenditure (0.6%-4.0% of current gross domestic product). Semistructured surveys and qualitative interviews of commission representatives demonstrated positive outcomes in several thematic areas, including understanding NCDIs of poverty, informing national planning and implementation of NCDI health-sector interventions, and improving governance and coordination for NCDIs. Overall, national NCDI Poverty Commissions provided a platform for evidence-based, locally driven determination of priorities within NCDIs.","92":"Depression is highly prevalent among people living with HIV in Malawi. Depression can undermine engagement in HIV care and worsen HIV morbidity and mortality. The Ministry of Health integrated a pilot depression management program into HIV care at 2 clinics. This program included a measurement-based care protocol for prescribing antidepressants and an adapted Friendship Bench psychotherapy protocol for providing problem solving. Early evaluations indicated successful integration of the initial stages of training and depression screening, diagnosis, and treatment initiation. This follow-up mixed-method investigation contextualizes our previous findings and shares insights from the implementation experience. We conducted a mixed-methods process evaluation drawing on both patient clinical data and qualitative interviews with patients and clinic staff. We focus on the following implementation outcomes: fidelity, acceptability, and sustainability. Although fidelity to depression screening and treatment initiation was high, fidelity to the follow-up treatment protocol was poor. Antidepressants and problem-solving therapy were acceptable to patients, but clinic staff found delivering treatment challenging given constrained human resources and infrastructure. The program was not sustained after the project. Key identified needs included substantial support to supervise the implementation of the program, continue to build and maintain the capacity of providers, integrate the program into the electronic medical records system, and ensure the availability of Friendship Bench counselors. Although initial steps were successful, sustained integration of this depression treatment program into HIV care in this setting met greater challenges. Implementation science studies that support both implementation and evaluation should recognize the potential for clinical implementers to rely on evaluation staff for clinical support and consider distancing evaluation staff from the actual program implementation. Further research is needed to test enhanced implementation strategies for integrating evidence-based mental health interventions into existing health care systems in a sustainable fashion, particularly in low-resource settings. ","93":"With the highest risk of maternal and newborn mortality occurring during the period around birth, quality of care during the intrapartum and immediate postpartum periods is critical for maternal and neonatal survival. The United States Agency for International Development's Scaling Up Reproductive, Maternal, Newborn, Child, and Adolescent Health Interventions project, also known as the Vriddhi project, collaborated with the national and 6 state governments to design and implement the Care Around Birth approach in 141 high caseload facilities across 26 high-priority districts of India from January 2016 to December 2017. The approach aimed to synergize evidence-based technical interventions with quality improvement (QI) processes, respectful maternity care, and health system strengthening efforts. The approach was designed using experiential training, mentoring, and a QI model. A baseline assessment measured the care ecosystem, staff competencies, and labor room practices. At endline, the approach was externally evaluated. Availability of logistics, recording and reporting formats, and display of protocols improved across the intervention facilities. At endline (October-December 2017), delivery and newborn trays were available in 98% of facilities compared to 66% and 55% during baseline (October-December 2015), respectively. Competency scores (&gt; 80%) for essential newborn care and newborn resuscitation improved from 7% to 70% and from 5% to 82% among health care providers, respectively. The use of partograph in monitoring labor improved from 29% at the baseline to 61%; administration of oxytocin within 1 minute of delivery from 35% to 93%; newborns successfully resuscitated from 71% to 96%; and postnatal monitoring of mothers from 52% to 94%. The approach successfully demonstrated an operational design to improve the provision and experience of care during the intrapartum and immediate postpartum periods, thereby augmenting efforts aimed at ending preventable child and maternal deaths. ","94":"In 2014, the Government of India (GOI) released operational guidelines on the use of antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) in preterm labor. However, without ensuring the quality of childbirth and newborn care at facilities, the use of ACS in low- and middle-income countries is potentially harmful. This study assessed the readiness to provide ACS at primary and secondary care public health facilities in northern India. A cross-sectional study was conducted in 37 public health facilities in 2 districts of Haryana, India. Facility processes and program implementation for ACS delivery were assessed using pretested study tools developed from the World Health Organization (WHO) quality of care standards and WHO guidelines for threatened preterm birth. Key gaps in public health facilities' process of care to provide ACS for threatened preterm birth were identified, particularly concerning evidence-based practices, competent workforce, and actionable health information system. Emphasis on accurate gestational age estimation, quality of childbirth care, and quality of preterm care were inadequate. Shortage of trained staff was widespread, and a disconnect was found between knowledge and attitudes regarding ACS use. ACS administration was provided only at district or subdistrict hospitals, and these facilities did not uniformly record ACS-specific indicators. All levels lacked a comprehensive protocol and job aids for identifying and managing threatened preterm birth. ACS operational guidelines were not widely disseminated or uniformly implemented. Facilities require strengthened supervision and standardization of threatened preterm birth care. Facilities need greater readiness to meet required conditions for ACS use. Increasing uptake of a single intervention without supporting it with adequate quality of maternal and newborn care will jeopardize improvement in preterm birth outcomes. We recommend updating and expanding the existing GOI ACS operational guidelines to include specific actions for the safe and effective use of ACS in line with recent scientific evidence. ","95":"In the Philippines, the \"no home-birthing policy\" implemented in 2008 has encouraged local governments to endorse ordinances that prohibit noninstitutional deliveries (NIDs). The Philippines' social insurance scheme has also enabled them to provide incentive payments to women who deliver at birthing facilities (BFs). This study evaluated whether these positive and\/or negative incentives were associated with an increased facility-based delivery (FBD) rate and examined challenges in implementing those incentive measures in the Eastern Visaya Region of the Philippines. Cross-sectional data were collected regarding delivery locations during 2017, and barangay-level data were collected regarding positive and negative incentives and the characteristics of 4,371 barangays in the region. Multivariate logistic regression analysis, using \"ordinance with nonmonetary sanction\" as the reference category, indicated that no ordinance to prohibit NIDs was significantly associated with a lower FBD rate (odds ratio [OR]: 0.90, P=.013), and ordinance with low cash penalty (OR: 1.37, P&lt;.001) and high cash penalty (OR: 2.52, P&lt;.001) had higher FBD rates. Positive incentives were not associated with FBD rates (OR: 1.02, P=.563). The FBD rate was also significantly associated with urban barangay status (OR: 1.45, P&lt;.001), availability of a vehicle (OR: 3.19, P&lt;.001), availability of public transportation to a government BF (OR: 1.25, P&lt;.001), and distance to the most accessible government BF (OR: 0.89, P&lt;.001). Substantial proportions of barangays had no vehicles available for transportation (34.1%) or no available vehicles and no public transportation to a government BF (5.5%). Although negative incentives for NIDs could motivate pregnant women to seek FBD, local governments in the Philippines should be aware of barriers that limit access to government BFs in underserved barangays before introducing those negative incentives. Above all, barangay-level investments in making a vehicle for transporting pregnant women might help address these barriers and increase the FBD rate.","96":"In 2012, the Philippines passed the Responsible Parenthood and Family Planning Law, a landmark legislation billed as a multisectoral and rights-based approach to further sustainable human development. This article is part of the first comprehensive evaluation of the implementation of the law by national-level actors. This evaluation is intended to assess the progress of implementers in the conduct of mandates, roles, and responsibilities described in the law and its implementing guidelines. Interviews with key national government officials and data from official documents and literature revealed 3 major trends in governance and implementation from 2014 to 2020. First, despite being a multisectoral policy, performance was siloed within individual units of implementing agencies, with limited interagency coordination. Second, although the law explicitly called for interventions to invest in human capital and address socioeconomic disparities for sustainable human development, performance focused on biomedical and health interventions, particularly in the area of family planning. Third, national-level governance for reproductive health interventions concentrated on programmatic and operational concerns. Overall, this case in the Philippines illustrates that fragmented implementation has contributed to the slow improvement of reproductive health outcomes. This study highlights the challenges of governance and multisectoral coordination to implement multidimensional interventions in a low- and middle-income country, and it provides potential areas for political and administrative reform in reproductive health governance in the Philippines. By creating a common narrative and onboarding multiple sectors, officials can better identify and address structural determinants with holistic policy solutions to improve reproductive health outcomes.","97":"Maintaining access to antimicrobials while preventing misuse is essential to combating the threat of antimicrobial resistance (AMR). The study objectives are to propose a framework of 16 indicators that can be used at the national level to assess the capacity to ensure access and curtail inappropriate use and to profile the antimicrobial supply chain for Bangladesh. Using a framework based on a rational construct, we assessed the antimicrobial supply chain of Bangladesh, with a focus on key players and products using a scoping review to obtain and describe information on 16 indicators. With players, we mapped linkages, manufacturers' production capacity, and ownership, among others, and demand point characteristics-pharmacy and pharmacist density, pharmacy\/medicine outlets dispersion, veterinary clinic\/hospitals, veterinarians' density, product quality, and regulation. We assessed product characteristics including listing on the World Health Organization (WHO) Model Essential Medicines List (EML) and WHO Access, Watch, and Reserve (AWaRe) classification of the major (top 10) antibiotics for human use; the proportion of medically important antimicrobials (MIAs) in veterinary use; and pricing. Production capacity and price controls were used to assess access and listing on the WHO EML, AWaRe\/MIA classification, and a calculated pharmacy-to-pharmacist ratio to assess use. Bangladesh has a high (98%) local antibiotic production capacity with pricing controls indicating the ability to ensure access. The presence of a high proportion of medicine outlets not under the control of pharmacists (4:1) and the high percentages of WHO Watch (54%) and MIAs (90%) of the major antibiotics are indicators of possible misuse. Most of the data used in the framework were publicly available. Bangladesh has the capacity to ensure access but needs to strengthen its ability to regulate the quality of antimicrobials and prevent their inappropriate use through antimicrobial stewardship at the community (medicine outlet) levels to check AMR. There may also be a need for more regulations on licensing of MIAs. ","98":"Hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection is endemic in Vietnam and can be transmitted from mother to child. Vaccination of women of reproductive age (WRA) can reduce this transmission. Because adult HBV vaccination in Vietnam follows a fee-for-service model, research is needed to determine the effect of household income on willingness to pay (WTP) to ensure equitable access to the vaccine. A cross-sectional study was performed in Hanoi, Vietnam, in April 2018, among WRA. Questionnaires were administered to assess household income, HBV history, vaccination status, vaccine awareness, and WTP for the vaccine. Multivariable logistic and interval regression were performed to assess the impact of household income on WTP for HBV vaccine. This study found that 62.3% of all participants were willing to pay for the HBV vaccine with no differences in WTP across income quintiles. There were significant differences among household income levels in awareness of HBV vaccination and WTP amount beyond US$4.50 with the lowest awareness and WTP amount among women from the lowest income quintiles. Our data suggest the need to subsidize HBV vaccination for low-income women to ensure more equitable access to HBV vaccination. We propose that a sliding-scale payment method may be an effective strategy in light of limited funding to support vaccination expansion. An education campaign focusing on lower-income households should also be implemented in conjunction with this program. Further research would be required to evaluate consumer acceptance of this payment scheme and to develop an appropriate sliding scale to maximize vaccine uptake. ","99":"Young people in sub-Saharan Africa face one of the world's highest burdens of sexual violence. Previous impact evaluations indicated that a 6-week empowerment-based behavioral intervention in Nairobi informal (slum) settlements can reduce sexual assault. This qualitative study investigated girls' and boys' experiences of the intervention to identify potential mechanisms of change. We conducted a qualitative study in Nairobi slums with students (aged 15-21 years) who had participated in 2 parallel school-based curriculums called IMPower (girls) and Your Moment of Truth (boys) at least 1 year ago. Data were collected via 10 focus group discussions (5 for boys, 5 for girls) with 6-11 participants in each and 21 individual in-depth interviews (11 boys, 10 girls) that explored participants' experiences of the intervention and their suggestions for improvement. Findings were analyzed using thematic network analysis guided by empowerment theory. Girls described how the intervention enabled them to recognize and resist sexual assault via verbal and physical strategies for self-protection, negotiate sexual consent, and exercise agency. Boys described increased ability to avoid risky behaviors and \"bad\" peer groups and to understand and respect consent. Girls also described how the intervention strengthened their self-confidence, and boys said that it boosted positive life values and gender-equal attitudes. Skilled facilitators and interactive and relevant content were highlighted as key to intervention success. Areas of improvement included expanding the curriculum to contain more content on sexual and reproductive health and rights and involving out-of-school youth, parents, teachers, and communities. Findings indicate that a relatively short, behavioral school-based intervention can empower both girls and boys to prevent various forms of sexual violence in a low-income setting where it is endemic. Incorporating multilevel support structures, such as involving communities and families, could further enhance young people's long-term safety, health, and well-being. ","100":"As part of a suite of training interventions to improve the knowledge and practice of immunization in the second year of life (2YL), training of trainers workshops were conducted with regional and district health management teams (DHMTs) in 15 districts in 3 regions of Ghana. Using adult learning principles, DHMTs implemented several capacity-building activities at the subdistrict and health facility levels, including health facility visits, on-the-job training, and review meetings. The current evaluation investigated whether frontline health care workers (HCWs) reported or demonstrated improvements in knowledge, attitudes, and practices after training interventions. Quantitative and qualitative methods with a utilization-focused approach guided the framework for this evaluation. A systematic random sample of 115 HCWs in 3 regions of Ghana was selected to complete a competency survey before and after training, which focused on 3 core competency areas-Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) policy; communication with caregivers; and immunization data management, recording, and use. Interviews and direct observations by data collectors were done to assess HCWs' knowledge, self-reported attitude, and behavior changes in practices. Of 115 HCWs, 102 were surveyed before and 4 months after receiving capacity-building interventions. Modest but not statistically significant improvements were found in knowledge on EPI policy, immunization data management, and communication skills with caregivers. HCWs reported that they had improved several attitudes and practices after the 2YL training. The most improved practice reported by HCWs and observed in all 3 regions was the creation of a defaulter list. Findings of this evaluation provide encouraging evidence in taking the first step toward improving HCW knowledge, attitudes, and practices for 3 core immunization competency areas. The use of learner-focused teaching methods combined with adult learning principles is helpful in solving specific performance problems (such as lack of knowledge of EPI policy). ","101":"A 2016 assessment of frontline health care workers (HCWs) in Ghana identified knowledge, skill, and attitude gaps related to immunization during the second year of life (2YL). The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention subsequently supported the Ghana Health Service Immunization Program to apply best practices of adult learning and training of trainers (TOT) for a cascade training program for 2YL. Five districts from each of the 3 regions (Greater Accra, Northern, and Volta) were selected for the TOT based on key measles and rubella vaccination coverage indicators. The design incorporated best practices of adult learning and TOT. The curriculum integrated 3 major topical themes: technical (immunization topics), operational, and training adults. The technical and operational content was based on HCW tasks most directly affecting 2YL objectives. A cross-functional team developed all classroom, field activity, and training evaluation materials. Seventy-four participants attended TOT workshops in 2017. Based on a rubric defined by the course designers, 99% of the participants reported an acceptable level of confidence to apply and teach the course content. After the TOTs, participants conducted 65 workshops, 43 field visits, and 4 review meetings, reaching 1,378 HCWs within 7 months. Fifty-four percent of HCWs who received training from TOT participants reported an acceptable level of confidence in using the skills, and 92% reported they would prioritize applying the skills acquired during the training. The success factors for effective adult learning and TOT can be applied to design and implement high-quality TOT even in resource-limited settings. The factors include using a variety of approaches, spending enough class time to prepare TOT participants for their training role, setting specific expectations for cascading the training, and following up through mentorship and reporting. Strong collaboration across the administrative levels of the Ghana Health Service enabled cascade training.

The key to reducing mortality is integrating HIV-TB services, however, a generalizable implementation method and package of tested change ideas to guide the scale-up of integrated HIV-TB services are unavailable. We describe the implementation of a quality improvement (QI) intervention, health systems' weaknesses, change ideas, and lessons learned in improving integrated HIV-TB services. Between December 1, 2016, and December 31, 2018, 8 nurse supervisors overseeing 20 primary health care (PHC) clinics formed a learning collaborative to improve a set of HIV-TB process indicators. HIV-TB process indicators comprised: HIV testing services (HTS), TB screening among PHC clinic attendees, isoniazid preventive therapy (IPT) for eligible HIV patients, antiretroviral therapy (ART) for HIV-TB coinfected patients, and viral load (VL) testing at month 12. Routine HIV-TB process data were collected and analyzed. Key change interventions, generated by health care workers, included: patient-flow redesign, daily data quality checks; prior identification of patients eligible for IPT and VL testing. Between baseline and post-QI intervention, IPT initiation rates increased from 15.9% to 76.4% (P=.019), HTS increased from 84.8% to 94.5% (P=.110), TB screening increased from 76.2% to 85.2% (P=.040), and VL testing increased from 61.4% to 74.0% (P=.045). ART initiation decreased from 95.8% to 94.1% (P=.481). Although integrating HIV-TB services is standard guidance, existing process gaps to achieve integration can be closed using QI methods. QI interventions can rapidly improve the performance of processes, particularly if baseline performance is low. Improving data quality enhances the success of QI initiatives.

In Cameroon and Zambia, EID coverage for HIV-exposed infants (HEIs) is suboptimal and the time to ART initiation for infants infected with HIV often exceeds national standards despite numerous policy and training initiatives. ICAP at Columbia University supported the Cameroon and Zambia Ministries of Health (MOHs) and local partners to implement quality improvement collaboratives (QICs) to improve EID coverage and ART initiation at 17 health facilities (HFs) in Cameroon (March 2016 to June 2017) and 15 HFs in Zambia (March 2017 to June 2018). In each country, MOH led project design and site selection. MOH and ICAP provided quality improvement training and monthly supportive supervision, which enabled HF teams to conduct root cause analyses, design and implement contextually appropriate interventions, conduct rapid tests of change, analyze monthly progress, and convene at quarterly learning sessions to compare performance and share best practices. In Cameroon, EID testing coverage improved from 57% (113\/197 HEIs tested) during the 5-month baseline period to 80% (165\/207) in the 5-month endline period. In Zambia, EID testing coverage improved from 77% (4,773\/6,197) during the 12-month baseline period to 89% (2,144\/2,420) during the 3-month endline period. In a comparison of the same baseline and endline periods, the return of positive test results to caregivers improved from 18% (36\/196 caregivers notified) to 86% (182\/211) in Cameroon and from 44% (94\/214) to 79% (44\/56) in Zambia. ART initiation improved from 44% (94\/214 HIV-infected infants) to 80% (45\/56) in Zambia; the numbers of HIV-infected infants in Cameroon were too small to detect meaningful differences. QICs improved coverage of timely EID and ART initiation in both countries. In addition to building quality improvement capacity and improving outcomes, the QICs resulted in a \"change package\" of successful initiatives that were disseminated within each country. ","113":"Implementation of maternal death surveillance and response (MDSR) is crucial to reduce maternal deaths. In Suriname, MDSR was not implemented until 2015. We describe the process of MDSR implementation in Suriname and share the \"lessons learned,\" as experienced by the health care providers, national maternal death review committee members, and public health experts. Before 2015, maternal deaths were identified using death certificates and by active surveillance in the hospitals. Based on the recommendations from a 2010-2014 Reproductive Age Mortality Survey in Suriname, a maternal death review committee has improved the identification of maternal deaths and has audited every death since 2015. Although this review committee initiated several actions to implement MDSR together with health care providers, the involvement of the Ministry of Health (MOH) was crucial. Therefore, the Maternal Health Steering Committee was recently installed as a direct working arm of MOH to guide MDSR implementation. One of the main barriers to implementing MDSR in Suriname has been the lack of action following recommendations. Delineating roles and responsibilities for action, establishing accountability mechanisms, and influencing stakeholders in a position to act are critical to ensure a response to the recommendations. To implement MDSR, the 5 Cs-commitment, \"no blame, no shame\" culture, coordination, collaboration, and communication-are crucial.","114":"Efforts to contain the spread of Ebola in the eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) during the 2018-2020 epidemic faced challenges in gaining community trust and participation. This affected implementation of community alerts, early isolation, contact tracing, vaccination, and safe and dignified burials. To quickly understand community perspectives and improve community engagement, collaborators from the DRC Red Cross, the International Federation of the Red Cross, and the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention explored a new method of collecting, coding, and quickly analyzing community feedback. Over 800 DRC Red Cross local volunteers recorded unstructured, free-text questions and comments from community members during community Ebola awareness activities. Comments were coded and analyzed using a text-coding system developed by the collaborators. Coded comments were then aggregated and qualitatively grouped into major themes, and time trends were examined. Communities reported a lack of information about the outbreak and the response, as well as concerns about the Ebola vaccination program and health care quality. Some doubted that Ebola was real. The response used the feedback to revise some community engagement approaches. For example, 2 procedural changes that were followed by drops in negative community responses were: using transparent body bags, which allayed fears that bodies or organs were being stolen, and widening the eligibility criteria for Ebola vaccination, which addressed concerns that selectively vaccinating individuals within Ebola-affected communities was unfair. This system is unique in that unstructured feedback collected by local volunteers in the course of their work was rapidly coded, analyzed, and given to health authorities for use in making course corrections throughout the response. It provides a platform for local voices to be heard throughout an emergency response and provides a mechanism for assessing the effects of program adjustments on community sentiments. ","115":"Few studies in low- and middle-income countries have examined the use of fertility awareness-based methods (FABMs) for pregnancy prevention. Understanding the prevalence of FABM use among Ghanaian contraceptors and the characteristics and practices of users is essential. Our 2018 nationally representative survey of Ghanaian women included detailed questions on the use of rhythm and Standard Days Method\/Cycle Beads (SDM). After considering multimethod use patterns, we estimated likely FABM prevalence among contraceptors, identified characteristics associated with current use of an FABM (vs. current use of a hormonal method\/intrauterine device [IUD]), and described how women report using FABMs. At least 18% of contracepting Ghanaian women likely use an FABM, though this may be underreported. Among FABM users, 57% reported current use of an FABM alone; the remainder reported concurrent use of other methods. Women who were older, richer, more educated, and had fewer children had higher odds of current FABM use versus IUD\/hormonal method. Although FABM users were more likely than other contraceptors to correctly identify the approximate fertile time, only 50% of FABM users did so correctly. Most (92%) rhythm users were interested in making their method use more effective. While 72% had heard of SDM, less than 25% had heard of various other ways to make the rhythm method more effective. Only 17% of rhythm users had ever discussed the method with a health professional. Rhythm users indicated substantial willingness to track additional biomarkers (e.g., daily temperature or cervical mucus) or to use a phone to enhance the effectiveness of their method, and most indicated no substantial difficulty getting partners to abstain or withdraw on fertile days. A nontrivial proportion of reproductive age Ghanaian women are using an FABM, nearly all of whom are interested in learning how to improve its effectiveness. The family planning field should better address these women's contraceptive needs in commitment to reproductive autonomy and choice.","116":"Many countries in Africa are scaling up differentiated service delivery (DSD) models for HIV treatment, but most existing data systems do not describe the models in use. We surveyed organizations that were supporting DSD models in 2019 in Malawi, South Africa, and Zambia to describe the diversity of DSD models being implemented at that time. We interviewed DSD model implementing organizations for descriptive information about each of the organization's models of care. We described the key characteristics of each model, including population of patients served, location of service delivery, frequency of interactions with patients, duration of dispensing, and cadre(s) of provider involved. To facilitate analysis, we refer to 1 organization supporting 1 model of care as an \"organization-model.\" The 34 respondents (8 in Malawi, 16 in South Africa, 10 in Zambia) interviewed described a total of 110 organization-models, which included 19 facility-based individual models, 21 out-of-facility-based individual models, 14 health care worker-led groups, and 3 client-led groups; jointly, these encompassed 12 specific service delivery strategies, such as multimonth dispensing, adherence clubs, home delivery, and changes to facility hours. Over two-thirds (n=78) of the organization-models were limited to clinically stable patients. Almost all organization-models (n=96) continued to provide clinical care at established health care facilities; medication pickup took place at facilities, external pickup points, and adherence clubs. Required numbers of provider interactions per year varied widely, from 2 to 12. Dispensing intervals were typically 3 or 6 months in Malawi and Zambia and 2 months in South Africa. Individual models relied more on clinical staff, while group models made greater use of lay personnel. As of 2019, there was a large variety of differentiated service models being offered for HIV treatment in Malawi, South Africa, and Zambia, serving diverse patient populations.

In Rwanda, anemia affects 37% of children under 5 years. The MNP program was implemented to address anemia, but research on factors affecting the implementation of the MNP program is limited. We conducted a mixed-methods study to examine the factors influencing access to and use of MNP among mothers (N=379) in Rutsiro district, northwest Rwanda. Inductive content analysis was used for qualitative data. Logistic regression analysis was used to determine factors associated with the use of MNP. Qualitative results indicated that the unavailability of MNP supplies and distribution issues were major barriers to accessing MNP. Factors influencing the use of MNP included mothers' perceptions of side effects and health benefits of MNP, as well as inappropriate complementary feeding practices. Mothers of older children (aged 12-23 months) were more likely to use MNP than those of younger children (aged 6-11 months) (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]=3.63, P&lt;.001). Mothers whose children participated in the supplementary food program were nearly 3 times more likely to use MNP than those whose children had never participated in the program (aOR=2.84, P=.001). Increasing household hunger score was significantly associated with lower odds of using MNP (aOR=0.80, P=.038). Mechanisms to monitor MNP supply and program implementation need to be strengthened to ensure mothers have access to the product. MNP program implementers should address gaps in complementary feeding practices and ensure mothers have access to adequate complementary foods.","123":null,"124":"Primarily funded by the United States Agency for International Development (USAID), the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) Faculty Fellows Program is designed to strengthen the institutional capacity of universities in low- and middle-income countries to use and analyze DHS data.

The current model involves a competitive team application process, 2 intensive in-person workshops, completion of a working paper of publishable quality, and the transfer of analysis skills learned during the fellowship to students and colleagues at home universities, all completed over 1 year. Since 2011, the Fellows Program has trained 152 researchers from 45 universities in 25 countries in Africa, Asia, and the Middle East. The program has not only strengthened individual skills in conducting research with data from large surveys but also substantially increased institutional capacity to analyze DHS data through fellows' capacity-building activities at their home universities. These successes have happened despite the many and continuing challenges related to fellows' diverse backgrounds, experience, skills, language barriers, logistical difficulties in organizing in-person workshops in fellows' countries, and sometimes fellows' varying levels of commitment.With continuous support from USAID, the program hopes to expand to more universities and countries, especially francophone countries. Overall, the DHS Faculty Fellows Program has proven to be highly successful and provides a model for other groups aiming to strengthen capacity for data use and research in low- and middle-income countries.","125":"Food fortification has proven to be an effective approach for preventing micronutrient deficiencies in many settings. Factors that lead to successful fortification programs are well established. However, due to the multisectoral nature of fortification and the added complexities present in many settings, the barriers to success are not always evident and the strategies to address them are not always obvious. We developed a systematic process for identifying and addressing gaps in the implementation of a food fortification program. The framework is composed of 4 phases: (1) connect program theory of change to program implementation; (2) develop an implementation research agenda; (3) conduct implementation research; and (4) analyze findings and develop\/disseminate recommendations for next steps. We detail steps in each phase to help guide teams through the process. To our knowledge, this is the first attempt to outline a systematic process for applying implementation science research to food fortification. The development of this framework is intended to promote implementation research in the field of food fortification, thus improving access to and effectiveness of this key public health intervention.","126":"In India, the private sector diagnoses and treats more patients with TB than the public sector. Gaps in the TB care cascade were observed more among the patients diagnosed in the private sector. The System for TB Elimination in Private Sector (STEPS) model evolved as a solution to address gaps in the quality of care for patients in the private sector by ensuring standards of TB care. STEPS has 3 components: a consortium of private hospitals, a coalition of all professional medical associations, and a STEPS center in each private hospital. STEPS centers act as a single window for notification, linkage for social welfare measures, contact investigation, chemoprophylaxis, direct benefit transfers, and treatment adherence support. STEPS was piloted in 14 districts in the state of Kerala. All 14 districts formed consortiums of private hospital management for policy support and a coalition of professional medical associations for advocacy with doctors. STEPS centers were established in 318 private hospitals. Notification to National TB Elimination Program from the private sector improved by 26% when compared to the previous year. Among the patients notified from the private sector, microbiologically confirmed cases increased by 81%, rifampicin resistance testing at baseline increased by 56%, and the percentage of those informed of their HIV status increased by 95%. The percentage of patients notified from the private sector with their treatment outcome reported improved from 39% (2018) to 99% (2019). The STEPS model demonstrated that a low-cost locally customized private sector engagement model is feasible and is beneficial to society. STEPS could be one of the major solutions for supporting patients reaching the private sector. ","127":"Early breastfeeding has numerous benefits for both the mother and her baby. Previous research typically analyzes breastfeeding initiation in binary terms (within the first hour or day). Although delays are associated with cesarean delivery and skin-to-skin contact may facilitate early breastfeeding, a more nuanced understanding of these relationships is needed. With data from 31 countries that had a Demographic and Health Survey since 2015, we described breastfeeding initiation among babies most recently born in the last 2 years to women aged 15-49 years. In a subset of 21 countries, we conducted survival analysis with multivariable log-logistic accelerated failure time (AFT) regressions to examine factors associated with time to initiation of breastfeeding, specifically the mode of delivery and skin-to-skin contact, controlling for receipt of health care as well as socioeconomic and demographic characteristics of mothers and babies. Babies in most countries began breastfeeding within a few hours after birth. The mean time to initiation of breastfeeding ranged from 1.7 hours in Burundi to 32 hours in Pakistan and 40 hours in Chad. In most countries (24 of 31), the median time was 0.5 hours. Median time to initiation was greater for births by cesarean delivery compared with vaginal births at health facilities. After controlling for covariates, AFT models showed significant delays in breastfeeding among cesarean deliveries in most countries, with as much as a 9-fold delay in Senegal. Immediate skin-to-skin contact was significantly associated with a shorter time to initiation. Efforts to promote early breastfeeding should encourage skin-to-skin and target cesarean deliveries. ","128":"Cambodia has made impressive progress in reducing malaria trends and, in 2018, reported no malaria-related deaths for the first time. However, the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic presents a potential challenge to the country's goal for malaria elimination by 2025. The path toward malaria elimination depends on sustained interventions to prevent rapid resurgence, which can quickly set back any gains achieved.Malaria Consortium supported mobile malaria workers (MMWs) to engage with target communities to build acceptance, trust, and resilience. At the start of the pandemic, Malaria Consortium conducted a COVID-19 risk assessment and quickly developed and implemented a mitigation plan to ensure MMWs were able to continue providing malaria services without putting themselves or their patients at risk. Changes in malaria intervention coverage and community uptake have been monitored to gauge the indirect effects of COVID-19. Comparisons have been made between output indicators reported in 2020 and from the same month-period of the previous year.In general, malaria service intervention coverage and utilization rates did not decline in 2020. Rather, the reported figures show there was a substantial increase in service utilization. Preliminary internal reviews and community meetings show that despite a heightened public risk perception toward COVID-19, malaria testing motivation has been well sustained throughout the pandemic. This may be attributable to proactive program planning and data monitoring and active engagement with the communities and the national authorities to circumvent the indirect effect of COVID-19 on intervention coverage in Cambodia during the pandemic.","129":"Despite the rapid increase in facility deliveries in Uganda, the number of adverse birth outcomes (e.g., neonatal and maternal deaths) has remained high. We aimed to codesign and co-implement a locally designed package of interventions to improve the quality of care in hospitals in the Busoga region. This project was designed and implemented in 3 phases in the 6 main hospitals in east-central Uganda from 2013 to 2016. First, the inception phase engaged health system managers to codesign the intervention. Second, the implementation phase involved training health providers, strengthening the data information system, and providing catalytic equipment and medicines to establish newborn care units (NCUs) within the existing infrastructure. Third, the hospital collaborative phase focused on clinical mentorship, maternal and perinatal death reviews (MPDRs), and collaborative learning sessions. In all 6 participating hospitals, we achieved institutionalization of NCUs in maternity units by establishing kangaroo mother care areas, resuscitation corners, and routine MPDRs. These improvements were associated with reduced maternal and neonatal deaths. Facilitators of success included a simple, low-cost, and integrated package designed with local health managers; the emergence of local neonatal care champions; implementation and support over a reasonably long period; decentralization of newborn care services; and use of mainly existing local resources (e.g., physical space, human resources, and commodities). Barriers to success related to limited hospital resources, unstable electricity, and limited participation from doctors. More advanced NCUs have been established in 3 of the 6 hospitals, and 7 high-volume comprehensive health centers have been established with functional NCUs. The involvement of local health workers and leaders was the foundation for designing, sustaining, and scaling up feasible interventions by harnessing available resources. These findings are relevant for the quality of care improvement efforts in Uganda and other resource-restrained settings. ","130":"","131":"","132":"","133":"Evidence from available studies suggests that peer mentoring is a useful tool to build health workers' knowledge, skills, and practices. However, there is a dearth of research on use of this method of learning in immunization programs. Although WhatsApp has been used as a networking platform among health care professionals, there is limited research on its potential contribution to improving the immunization competencies of health workers. This study showed that peer mentoring and WhatsApp networking are useful blended learning methods for need-based and individualized capacity building of health workers providing immunization services. Future research to assess the comparative cost-benefit between classroom-based training and peer mentoring (along with WhatsApp networking) will be useful.","134":"Chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection is a major public health problem in many low- and middle-income countries. In 2015, Egypt's HCV infection prevalence of 7% among adults was among the highest in the world and accounted for 7.6% of the country's mortality. In 2014, Egypt embarked on an aggressive screening and treatment program that evolved into a national strategy to eliminate HCV as a public health threat by 2021. In this qualitative case study, we analyzed Egypt's HCV control strategy using the Kingdon framework to understand how the problem, policy, and political streams merged to create an opportunity to achieve an ambitious elimination goal. We describe key aspects of the implementation, identify lessons learned, and provide recommendations for other low- and middle-income countries aiming to eliminate HCV. Between 2014 and 2020, Egypt screened more than 50 million and treated more than 4 million residents for HCV. Five key elements contributed to Egypt's successful HCV elimination program: (1) sufficient and reliable epidemiologic data to quantify and monitor public health threats; (2) a robust public health care infrastructure; (3) inclusive care that reached all sectors of society; (4) increased health care spending; and (5) innovative scientific research and use of information technology. Egypt conducted a successful HCV screening program that covered more than 50 million residents and treated more than 4 million. It is poised to be the first country in the world to eliminate HCV within its borders. The lessons learned from this experience can inform the elimination plans of other low- and middle-income countries with high HCV burden. ","135":"There is an urgent need for data to inform coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic response efforts. At the same time, the pandemic has created challenges for data collection, one of which is interviewer training in the context of social distancing. In sub-Saharan Africa, in-person interviewer training and face-to-face data collection remain the norm, requiring researchers to think creatively about transitioning to remote settings to allow for safer data collection that respects government guidelines. Performance Monitoring for Action (PMA, formerly PMA2020) has collected both cross-sectional and longitudinal data on key reproductive health measures in Africa and Asia since 2013. Relying on partnerships with in-country research institutes and cadres of female interviewers recruited from sampled communities, the project was well-positioned to transition to collecting data on COVID-19 from the onset of the pandemic. This article presents PMA's development of a remote training system for COVID-19 surveys in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Kenya, and Nigeria, including challenges faced and lessons learned. We demonstrate that remote interviewer training can be a viable approach when data are critically needed and in-person learning is not possible. We also argue against systematic replacement of in-person trainings with remote learning, instead recommending consideration of local context and a project's individual circumstances when contemplating a transition to remote interviewer training.","136":"A critical shortage of health workers with needed maternal and newborn competencies remains a major challenge for the provision of quality care for mothers and newborns, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. Supply-side challenges related to human resources for health (HRH) worsen shortages and can negatively affect health worker performance and quality of care. This review scoped country-focused sources to identify and map evidence on HRH-related challenges to quality facility-based newborn care provision by nurses and midwives. Evidence for this review was collected iteratively, beginning with pertinent World Health Organization documents and extending to articles identified via database and manual reference searches and country reports. Evidence from country-focused sources from 2000 onward was extracted using a data extraction tool that was designed iteratively; thematic analysis was used to map the 10 categories of HRH challenges. A total of 332 peer-reviewed articles were screened, of which 22 met inclusion criteria. Fourteen additional sources were added from manual reference search and gray literature sources. Evidence has been mapped into 10 categories of HRH-related challenges: (1) lack of health worker data and monitoring; (2) poor health worker preservice education; (3) lack of HW access to evidence-based practice guidelines, continuing education, and continuing professional development; (4) insufficient and inequitable distribution of health workers and heavy workload; (5) poor retention, absenteeism, and rotation of experienced staff; (6) poor work environment, including low salary; (7) limited and poor supervision; (8) low morale, motivation, and attitude, and job dissatisfaction; (9) weaknesses of policy, regulations, management, leadership, governance, and funding; and (10) structural and contextual barriers. The mapping provides needed insight that informed new World Health Organization strategies and supporting efforts to address the challenges identified and strengthen human resources for neonatal care, with the ultimate goal of improving newborn care and outcomes. ","137":"Uganda faces a complex policy landscape as it simultaneously addresses infectious diseases and noncommunicable diseases (NCDs). The health system has been overwhelmed by the growing burden of NCDs across all socioeconomic strata. In this study, we sought to understand the policy context around NCDs in Uganda, the roles of actors both within and external to the government, and the factors shaping the development and implementation of NCD policies and programs in Uganda. We conducted in-depth interviews with 30 policy actors from the Ugandan Ministry of Health (MOH), nongovernmental organizations, and academia to understand the roles of different actors in the Ugandan NCD space, the programs and policy measures in discussion, and how to bridge any identified gaps. A thematic data analysis was conducted. All national actors viewed funding constraints as a critical barrier to developing and executing an NCD strategic plan and as a barrier to leading and coordinating NCD prevention and control efforts in Uganda. The crowding of nongovernment actors was found to fragment NCD efforts, particularly due to the weak implementation of a framework for action among NCD actors. Relatedly, limited recruitment of technical experts on NCDs within the MOH was viewed to further diminish the government's role in leading policy and program formulation and implementation. Though recent MOH efforts have aimed at addressing these concerns, some skepticism remains about the government's commitment to increase budgetary allocations for NCDs and to address the technical and human resources gaps needed to achieve NCD policy aims in Uganda. This study highlights the immediate need to mobilize more resources, reduce fragmented efforts in the NCD space, and prioritize investment in NCD prevention and management in Uganda. ","138":null,"139":"Postpartum family planning is an effective means of achieving improved health outcomes for women and children, especially in low- and middle-income settings. We assessed the cost-effectiveness of an immediate postpartum intrauterine device (PPIUD) initiative compared with standard practice in Bangladesh and Tanzania (which is no immediate postpartum family planning counseling or service provision) to inform resource allocation decisions for governments and donors. A decision analysis was constructed to compare the PPIUD program with standard practice. The analysis was based on the number of PPIUD insertions, which were then modeled using the Impact 2 tool to produce estimates of cost per couple-years of protection (CYP) and cost per disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) averted. A micro-costing approach was used to estimate the costs of conducting the program, and downstream cost savings were generated by the Impact 2 tool. Results are presented first for the program as evaluated, and second, based on a hypothetical national scale-up scenario. One-way sensitivity analyses were conducted. Compared to standard practice, the PPIUD program resulted in an incremental cost-effectiveness ratio (ICER) of US$14.60 per CYP and US$91.13 per DALY averted in Bangladesh, and US$54.57 per CYP and US$67.67 per DALY averted in Tanzania. When incorporating estimated direct health care costs saved, the results for Bangladesh were dominant (PPIUD is cheaper and more effective versus standard practice). For Tanzania, the PPIUD initiative was highly cost-effective, with the ICER (incorporating direct health care costs saved) estimated at US$15.20 per CYP and US$18.90 per DALY averted compared to standard practice. For the national scale-up model, the results were dominant in both countries.Conclusions\/implications: The PPIUD initiative was highly cost-effective in Bangladesh and Tanzania, and national scale-up of PPIUD could produce long-term savings in direct health care costs in both countries. These analyses provide a compelling case for national governments and international donors to invest in PPIUD as part of their family planning strategies. ","140":"To ensure equitable and accessible services and improved utilization of institutional delivery it is important to identify what progress has been achieved, whether there are vulnerable and disadvantaged groups that need specific attention and what are the key factors affecting the utilization of institutional delivery services. In this study, we examined levels, trends, and inequalities in the utilization of institutional delivery services in low- and middle-income countries. We used nationally representative cross-sectional data from Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) conducted during 1990-2018. Bayesian linear regression analysis was performed. Among 74 countries, the utilization of institutional delivery services ranged from 23.7% in Chad to 100% in Ukraine and Armenia (with &gt;90% in 19 countries and &lt;50% in 13 countries) during the latest DHS rounds. Trend analysis in 63 countries with at least 2 surveys showed that the utilization of institutional delivery services increased in 60 countries during 1990-2018, with the highest increase being in Cambodia (18.3%). During this period, the utilization of institutional delivery services increased in 90.3% of countries among the richest, 95.2% of countries in urban, and 84.1% of countries among secondary+ educated women. The utilization of institutional delivery services was higher among wealthiest, urban, and secondary+ educated women compared to their counterparts. Greater utilization of private facilities for delivery was observed in women from the highest income group and urban communities, whereas highest utilization of public facilities was observed for women from the lowest income group and rural communities. The utilization of institutional delivery services varied substantially between and within countries over time. Significant disparities in service utilization identified in this study highlight the need for tailored support for women from disadvantaged and vulnerable groups. ","141":"Implementation research often fails to have its intended impact on what programs actually do. Embedding research within target organizational systems represents an effective response to this problem. However, contradictions associated with the approach often prevent its application. We present case studies of the application of embedded implementation research in Bangladesh, Ghana, and Tanzania where initiatives to strengthen community-based health systems were conducted using the embedded science model. In 2 of the cases, implementation research standards that are typically embraced without question were abandoned to ensure pursuit of embedded science. In the third example, statistical rigor was sustained, but this feature of the design was inconsistent with embedded science. In general, rigorous statistical designs employ units of observation that are inconsistent with organizational units that managers can control. Structural contradictions impede host institution ownership of research processes and utilization of results. Moreover, principles of scientific protocol leadership are inconsistent with managerial leadership. These and other embedded implementation science attributes are reviewed together with contradictions that challenged their pursuit in each case. Based on strategies that were effectively applied to offsetting challenges, a process of merging research with management is proposed that is derived from computer science. Known as \"agile science,\" this paradigm combines scientific rigor with management decision making. This agile embedded research approach is designed to sustain scientific rigor while optimizing the integration of learning into managerial decision making.","142":"As HIV testing increases worldwide, programs are reaching individuals without HIV infection who are at risk of exposure and may be candidates for oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Although linkage of individuals with HIV infection to treatment is a global priority (referred to as \"test and treat\"), less attention is given to individuals with negative HIV test results. We developed the \"Test and Prevent\" pilot program to intentionally link at-risk clients with negative HIV test results to PrEP services. The intervention included risk assessment of all clients with a negative result from HIV testing (with national risk assessment tool), accompanied referral, fast-tracking, and targeting follow-up. The intervention was conducted in Bulawayo, Zimbabwe, at 6 public sector sites from October 2019 to February 2020. We collected routine monitoring data from all study sites and tracked referral completion and PrEP initiation among clients who enrolled. We conducted in-depth interviews with providers (n=12), facility managers (n=5), and female clients (n=17) to explore acceptability. Among clients referred for PrEP (n=206), 98% completed their referrals and started PrEP. However, only 3% of clients who received a negative test result during the study period were referred. Low referrals stemmed from lack of screening (39% of clients with negative HIV test results were not screened) and lack of eligibility among clients who were screened (only 6% of those screened qualified as candidates for PrEP per the national screening tool). Qualitative results indicate that some providers purposefully did not complete screening with clients they felt were not at risk and that workload could have contributed to low screening uptake.Qualitative interviews showed that Test and Prevent was acceptable among both providers and clients. Clients were happy to learn about PrEP following HIV testing, and the additional support of accompanied referrals and fast-tracking encouraged them to access PrEP and made them feel valued. Providers were burdened by workload constraints but felt that Test and Prevent was important and should be scaled to other sites. Intentionally linking clients with negative results to PrEP immediately following HIV testing was found to be acceptable from both provider and client perspectives, yet screening procedures need closer examination and reinforcement for the program to realize a larger impact.

This review provides a summary of the state of medical device regulation in the 14 member countries of the College of Surgeons of East, Central, and Southern Africa (COSECSA) and South Africa. Countries were categorized according to level of regulatory establishment, which was found to be positively correlated to gross domestic product (GDP; rs=0.90) and years of freedom from colonization (rs=0.60), and less positively correlated to GDP per capita (rs=0.40). Although most countries mandate medical device regulation in national legislation, few employ all the guidelines set forth by the World Health Organization. A streamlined regulatory process across African nations would simplify this process for innovators seeking to bring medical devices to the African market, thereby increasing patient access to safe medical devices.","146":"Community clinics (CCs) staffed by community health workers (CHWs) represent an effort of the Government of Bangladesh to strengthen the grassroots provision of primary health care services and to accelerate progress in achieving universal health coverage. The Improving Community Health Workers (ICHWs) Project of Save the Children piloted a CC-centered health service (CCHS) model that strengthened community and local government engagement, harmonized the work of different CHW cadres who were working in the same catchment area of each CC, and improved the accountability of CHWs and the CC to the local community. We describe the process for developing and implementing the CCHS model in 6 unions in Barishal District where the model was piloted and provide some early qualitative and quantitative findings pertaining to the model's effectiveness. Data were collected from CCs in the 6 pilot unions and 6 other unions that served as a control. Qualitative data were collected from the intervention area during the pre-pilot (October 2017-September 2018) and pilot phase (October 2018-September 2019). Document review, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions were also conducted. Maternal and child health service utilization data were extracted from the government health information system in both the intervention and control areas. Community group meetings ensured engagement with local government authorities and supported resource mobilization. There was greater coordination of work among CHWs and increased motivation of CHWs to better serve their clients. The analysis showed that the increase in maternal health consultations was substantially greater in the intervention area than in the control area, as was the number of referrals for higher-level care. The CCHS model as applied in this pilot project is effective in engaging local key stakeholders, increasing CHW capacity, and improving client satisfaction. The model demonstrated that a community health system can be strengthened by a comprehensive approach that engages communities and local government officials and that harmonizes the work of CHWs. ","147":"Community health workers (CHWs) are integrated into health systems through a variety of designs. Partners In Health (PIH), a nongovernmental organization with more than 30 years of experience in over 10 countries, initially followed a vertical approach by assigning CHWs to individual patients with specific conditions, such as HIV, multidrug resistant-TB, diabetes, and other noncommunicable diseases, to provide one-on-one psychosocial and treatment support. Starting in 2015, PIH-Malawi redesigned their CHW assignments to focus on entire households, thereby offering the opportunity to address a wider variety of conditions in any age group, all with a focus on working toward effective universal health coverage. Inspired by this example, PIH-Liberia and then PIH-Mexico engaged in a robust cross-site dialogue on how to adapt these plans for their unique nongovernmental organization-led CHW programs. We describe the structure of this \"household model,\" how these structures were changed to adapt to different country contexts, and early impressions on the effects of these adaptations. Overall, the household model is proving to be a feasible and functional method for organizing CHW programs so that they can contribute toward achieving universal health coverage, but there is no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach. Other countries planning on adopting this model should plan to analyze and adapt as needed.","148":"Unreliable and nonexistent supply chain procedures and processes are one of the primary barriers to achieving functional community health units in nomadic communities in the arid\/semiarid counties of Kenya. We used a human-centered design (HCD) approach to engage communities and community health volunteers (CHVs) in redesigning a proven data-centric supply chain approach that included a digital solution, called cStock, for this challenging context. We conducted the HCD process in 4 phases: (1) understanding intent, (2) research and insights, (3) ideation and prototyping, and (4) supply chain design and requirements building. Data collection used qualitative methods and involved a range of stakeholders including CHVs, supervisors, and local beneficiaries. CHVs and their supervisors also participated in cStock usability testing. Drawing on insights and personas generated from the research, stakeholders ideated and codesigned supply chain tools. The research identified critical insights for informing the redesign of cStock for nomadic communities. These insights were categorized into supply chain, information systems, human resources, behaviors, service delivery infrastructure, and connectivity. Four supply chain data solutions were designed, prototyped, tested, and iterated: a stock recording paper-based form, a user-friendly cStock application, a supervisor cStock application, and an unstructured supplementary service data reporting system using feature phones. Using the HCD process incorporated the perspective of CHVs and their communities and provided key insights to inform the design of the supply chain and adapt cStock. The process helped make cStock to be inclusive and have the potential to have a meaningful impact on strengthening the supply chain for seminomadic and nomadic communities in northern Kenya. A strong supply chain for these CHVs will increase access to essential and reproductive health commodities and contribute to improving the overall health and well-being of these communities, especially women and children. ","149":"Childhood malnutrition is a nationally-recognized problem in Tajikistan. In 2017, 6% of children under 5 years were wasted and 18% were stunted. Through the Tajikistan Health and Nutrition Activity (THNA), funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development's Feed the Future, IntraHealth International trained 1,370 volunteer community health workers (CHWs) and 500 community agricultural workers (CAWs) in 500 rural communities to improve nutrition among children and pregnant and breastfeeding women. CHWs and CAWs mutually encourage health behavior change, reinforce better agricultural practices, and promote maternal and child health and nutritious diets through household visits, community events, and peer support groups. CHWs refer children with malnutrition and diarrhea and pregnant women who are not registered for antenatal care to health facilities. THNA supported CHWs\/CAWs through peer learning, refresher trainings, supportive supervision, and quarterly material incentives. We observed gains in knowledge, attitudes, and practices across health; nutrition; water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH); and agriculture in target communities. From 2016 to 2019, we observed statistically significant (P&lt;.05) improvements in children receiving a minimum acceptable diet; children with diarrhea receiving more liquids; women making 4 or more antenatal care visits; women reporting improved WASH; and farmers demonstrating improved agricultural practices. A February 2020 screening of 94.6% of children under 5 years in target communities found the prevalence of children with signs of wasting at 2.2%. Partnerships between CHWs, CAWs, and rural health workers facilitated these results. Paired agricultural and health interventions proved successful in improving nutrition of children and may be applicable in other contexts. Although effective in delivering interventions, CHWs\/CAWs experience attrition, need motivation, and require intensive support. Assuming responsibility for this community-based volunteer workforce presents a major challenge for Tajikistan's national and local governments.","150":"Delays due to long distances to health facilities, poor road infrastructure, and lack of affordable transport options contribute to the burden of maternal deaths in Mozambique. This study aimed to assess the implementation and uptake of an innovative community-based transport program to improve access to emergency obstetric care in southern Mozambique. From April 2016 to February 2017, a community transport strategy was implemented as part of the Community Level Interventions for Pre-eclampsia Trial. The study aimed to reduce maternal and perinatal mortality and morbidity by 20% in intervention clusters in Maputo and Gaza Provinces, Mozambique, by involving community health workers in the identification and referral of pregnant and puerperal women at risk. Based on a community-based participatory needs assessment, the transport program was implemented with the trial. Demographics, conditions requiring transportation, means of transport used, route, and outcomes were collected during implementation. Data were entered into a REDCap database. Fifty-seven neighborhoods contributed to the needs assessment; of those, 13 (23%) implemented the transport program. Neighborhoods were selected based on their expression of interest and ability to contribute financially to the program (US$0.33 per family per month). In each selected neighborhood, a community management committee was created, training in small-scale financial management was conducted, and monitoring tools were provided. Twenty people from 9 neighborhoods benefited from the transport program, 70% were pregnant and postpartum women. These results demonstrate that it was feasible to implement a community-based transport program with no external input of vehicles, fuel, personnel, and maintenance. However, high cost and a lack of acceptable transport options in some communities continue to impede access to obstetric health care services and the ability for timely follow-up. When strengthening capacities of community health workers to promptly assist and refer emergency cases, it is crucial to encourage local transport programs and transportation infrastructure among minimally resourced communities to support access and engagement with health systems. ","151":"Community health workers (CHWs) can provide lifesaving treatment for children in remote areas, but high-quality care is essential for effective delivery. Measuring the quality of community-based care in remote areas is logistically challenging. Clinical vignettes have been validated in facility settings as a proxy for competency. We assessed feasibility and effectiveness of clinical vignettes to measure CHW knowledge of integrated community case management (iCCM) in Liberia's national CHW program. We developed 3 vignettes to measure knowledge of iCCM illnesses (malaria, diarrhea, and pneumonia) in 4 main areas: assessment, diagnosis, treatment, and caregiver instructions. Trained nurse supervisors administered the vignettes to CHWs in 3 counties in rural Liberia as part of routine program supervision between January and May 2019, collected data on CHW knowledge using a standardized checklist tool, and provided feedback and coaching to CHWs in real time after vignette administration. Proportions of vignettes correctly managed, including illness classification, treatment, and referral where necessary, were calculated. We assessed feasibility, defined as the ability of clinical supervisors to administer the vignettes integrated into their routine activities once per year for each CHW, and effectiveness, defined as the ability of the vignettes to measure the primary outcomes of CHW knowledge of diagnosis and treatment including referrals. We were able to integrate this assessment into routine supervision, facilitate real-time coaching, and collect data on iCCM knowledge among 155 CHWs through delivery of 465 vignettes. Diagnosis including severity was correct in 65%-82% of vignettes. CHWs correctly identified danger signs in 44%-50% of vignettes, correctly proposed referral to the facility in 63% of vignettes including danger signs, and chose correct lifesaving treatment in 23%-65% of vignettes. Both diagnosis and lifesaving treatment rates were highest for malaria and lowest for severe pneumonia. Administration of vignettes to assess knowledge of correct iCCM case management was feasible and effective in producing results in this setting. Proportions of correct diagnosis and lifesaving treatment varied, with high proportions for uncomplicated disease, but lower for more severe cases, with accurate recognition of danger signs posing a challenge. Future work includes validation of vignettes for use with CHWs through direct observation, strengthening supportive supervision, and program interventions to address identified knowledge gaps. ","152":"Across the Greater Mekong Subregion (GMS) and Central America, governments commonly employ community health workers (CHWs) to improve access to and uptake of malaria services. Many of these networks are vertical in design, organized to extend malaria-only services to those remaining communities in which malaria persists. Between 2019 and 2020, national ministries of health (MOH) and Clinton Health Access Initiative conducted mixed-methods CHW program evaluations across the GMS and Central America. Routine surveillance and programmatic data were analyzed to quantify CHW contributions to malaria elimination objectives and identify gaps and challenges. Semistructured interviews were conducted with governmental and nongovernmental stakeholders from central to community level. This article draws comparisons between the Lao People's Democratic Republic (PDR) and Honduras CHW program evaluation results to distill broader hypotheses about how vertical CHW programs might evolve as their primary mission nears its end. CHWs contribute substantially to malaria case detection and surveillance, diagnosing and treating 27% of malaria cases in Lao PDR and 55% in the department of Gracias a Dios, Honduras in 2019. In the same year, malaria test positivity neared less than 1% in both countries. In 2019, 80% of CHWs in Lao PDR and 74% in Gracias a Dios, Honduras did not report a single malaria case. From inception, both programs were organized as vertical (malaria-only) CHW programs reliant upon Global Fund financing for malaria commodities, training, supervision and, where applicable, remuneration. Although community case management by CHWs has been highly impactful in reducing malaria cases to near zero, new challenges of acceptability and effectiveness of malaria-only service delivery, feasibility of continued vertical program management, and sustainable financing have emerged. To achieve and sustain reductions in malaria, surveillance and delivery platforms must be redesigned to encourage (and reward) care seeking based on experience of symptoms and not on a patient or caregiver's presumptive diagnosis of disease. By expanding the roles and responsibilities of currently vertical malaria CHWs, malarial interventions can be optimized and sustained. Such a shift will also position existing community-based platforms to be resilient and responsive as epidemiology of disease and community need shift. ","153":"In Mali, community health workers (CHWs) deliver essential community care (ECC) to rural populations. The dominance of external funding for the program threatens the sustainability of this critical workforce as donor financing decreases. This article summarizes results of analyses aimed at assisting Mali's decision makers and leaders in initiating a transition to a sustainable CHW program supported by domestic funding through strategic and rational investment. Data on ECC implementation norms, workforce, coverage, utilization, cost, and geospatial features were collected between 2016 and 2019. The data informed interlinked CHW financing analyses-situational, services costing, efficiency, and geospatial mapping. Analysis showed distribution of reported expenditures, estimates of required CHW funding, cost-saving options, and spatially visualized discrepancies between spending estimates and normative costs. Thirteen financing sources contributed to CHW program expenditures, 88% of which were from international donors, for a package of 23 curative, preventive, and promotive interventions. In 2015, the CHW program spent US$13.01 million; an estimated US$8.36 million would have been needed to achieve the same service volume under standard care protocols. Medicines and start-up training had US$6.88 million more than needed; supervision, program management, and recurrent training components were underfunded by US$2.2 million. Cost-saving opportunities of US$6.16 million were identified in 41 of 44 districts. Funding reallocation opportunities (after meeting technical efficiency requirements) were identified in 20 of 44 districts (US$2.56 million). Use of geospatial targeting and mapping suggests district- and village-level reallocation options for theoretical funding surpluses. CHW costs can be significantly reduced without sacrificing service technical quality. Spending can be geographically targeted to optimize service use by rural populations. Efficiency analyses provide evidence to build stronger engagement, support improved decision making, efficiently prioritize resources, and target investments for sustainable financing of CHW programs. ","154":"Community health worker (CHW) programs are a critical component of health systems, notably in lower- and middle-income countries. However, when policy recommendations exceed what is feasible to implement, CHWs are overstretched by the volume of activities, implementation strength is diluted, and programs fail to produce promised outcomes. To counteract this, we developed a time-use modeling tool-the CHW Coverage and Capacity (C3) Tool-and used it with government partners in Rwanda and Zanzibar to address common policy questions related to CHW needs, coverage, and time optimization.In Rwanda, the C3 Tool was used to analyze 2 well-established cadres of CHWs and 1 new one. The well-established CHW cadres were within a \"manageable\" workload range whereas the new cadre was projected to achieve less than half of assigned activities. This is informing ongoing changes to the CHWs' scopes of work. In Zanzibar, the C3 Tool was used to update the national community health strategy to include community health volunteers (CHVs) for the first time and determine how many CHVs were needed. The tool projected that 2,200 CHVs could achieve approximately 90% coverage of all defined services. Based on these figures, Zanzibar updated its national community health strategy, which officially launched in February 2020.We discuss lessons from these 2 experiences. Translating analysis into decision making depends not only on the programmatic will and motivation of governments but also on finding opportune timing for when policy and program processes allow for optimization of CHW investments. Further research is needed but our experience supports the value of a modeling tool to ground program plans within estimated constraints on CHW time.","155":"The renewed commitment to primary health care (PHC) presents an opportunity to strengthen health systems in West and Central Africa (WCA). Though evidence-based cost-effective interventions that are predicted to prevent up to one-third of maternal, newborn, and child health complications and deaths with universal coverage have been identified, more than 50% of people living in rural areas or from poor families still do not have access to these interventions in resource-constrained settings. We conducted a multicountry systematic analysis of bottlenecks and proposed solutions to strengthen community health systems through a series of collaborative workshops in 22 countries in WCA. Countries were categorized by their under-5 mortality rate (U5MR) to assess specificities related to reported challenges. We also reviewed existing data on selected health system tracer interventions to analyze country profiles. The bottlenecks identified as severe or very severe were related to health financing (19 countries, 86%), essential medical technology and products (16 countries, 73%), integrated health service delivery (14 countries, 64%), and community ownership and partnerships (self-reported by 14 countries, 64%). Only the integrated service delivery was self-reported as a severe challenge by countries with high U5MR. The issue of human resources for community health was one of the least reported challenges. In WCA, strengthening community health systems as part of PHC revitalization efforts should focus on increasing health financing and innovative investments, strengthening the logistics management system, and fostering community ownership and partnerships. Countries with high U5MR should also reinforce integrated service delivery approaches through innovation. Government actions galvanized by global and regional ongoing initiatives should be sustained to ensure that no one is left behind. ","156":"To develop guidance for governments and partners seeking to scale community health worker programs, we developed a conceptual framework, collected observations from the scale-up efforts of 7 countries, workshopped the framework with technical groups and with country stakeholders, and reviewed literature in the areas of health and policy reform, change management, institutional development, health systems, and advocacy. We observed that successful scale-up is a complex process of institutional reform. Successful scale-up: (1) depends on a carefully choreographed, problem-driven political process; (2) requires that scaled program models are drawn from solutions that are available in a given health system context and aligned with the resources, capabilities, and commitments of key health sector stakeholders; and (3) emerges from iterative cycles of learning and improvement, rather than a single, linear scale-up effort. We identify stages of the reform process associated with each of these 3 findings: problem prioritization, coalition building, solution gathering, design, program readiness, launch, governance, and management and learning. The resulting Community Health Systems Reform Cycle can be used by government, donors, and nongovernmental partners to prioritize and design community health worker scale-up efforts, diagnose challenges or gaps in successful scale-up and integration, and coordinate the contributions of diverse stakeholders.","157":"","158":"","159":"","160":"","161":"","162":"Few women in low- and middle-income countries have access to the hormonal intrauterine system (IUS). Past research from a small number of facilities and the private sector suggest the IUS could be an important addition to the contraceptive method mix because it is the only long-acting method some women will adopt and users report high satisfaction and continuation. We aimed to determine whether these promising results were applicable in public facilities in Kenya and Zambia. We used a mixed-methods approach with program monitoring data, interviews with women who received an IUS, and qualitative focus group discussions with providers. Data were collected in 2017-2019. Facilities in Kenya and Zambia reported 1,985 and 428 IUS insertions, respectively. If the IUS had not been available, 30% of adopters would have chosen a short-acting method. Women and providers gave diverse reasons for adopting the IUS, with the desire for fewer side effects being frequently mentioned in focus group discussions. Many IUS adopters first heard of the method on the day it was inserted (70% in Kenya, 47% in Zambia), yet providers reported that many women were unwilling to try a method they were just hearing about for the first time. Satisfaction and continuation were high: 86% of adopters in Kenya were still using the method 3-6 months after insertion and 78% were in Zambia (average 10 months post insertion). Providers also reported that most IUS adopters were satisfied; they rarely returned with complaints that could not be addressed with additional counseling. Expanding IUS access through the public sector shows promise to increase contraception use and continuation in low- and middle-income countries. Efforts to strengthen availability should consider demand and engage directly with various communities, including youth, around availability of a new long-acting option. ","163":"Novel approaches to case identification and linkage to antiretroviral therapy (ART) are needed to close gaps in early infant diagnosis (EID) of HIV. Point-of-care (POC) EID is a recent innovation that eliminates the long turnaround times of conventional EID that limit patient management in the inpatient setting. The initial deployment of POC EID in Mozambique focused primarily on outpatient clinics; however, 2 high-volume tier-4 pediatric referral hospitals were also included. To assess the impact of inpatient POC EID, a retrospective review of testing and care data from Hospital Central de Beira (HCB) and Hospital Central de Maputo (HCM) was performed for the period September 2017 to July 2018, with comparison to the 8-month pre-POC period when dried blood spots were used for conventional EID. Monthly testing volume increased from 8.5 tests pre-POC to 17.6 tests with POC (P&lt;.001). Among 511 children with POC testing, the median age was 5 months, there was ongoing breastfeeding in 326 (63.8%), and 136 (26.6%) of mothers and 146 (28.6%) of infants had not received ART or antiretroviral prophylaxis, respectively. POC tests were positive in 152 (29.7%) infants, and 52 (37.5%) had a previous negative DNA polymerase chain reaction through the conventional outpatient EID program. Linkage to ART for infants with HIV-positive tests improved 64% during the POC period (P=.002). Inpatient mortality for infected infants during the POC period was 28.2%. Excluding these deaths, 61.2% of eligible infants initiated ART as inpatients, but only 29.8% of those discharged without ART were confirmed to have initiated as outpatients. Inpatient wards are a high-yield site for EID and ART initiation that have historically been overlooked in programming for prevention of mother-to-child transmission. POC platforms represent a transformative opportunity to increase inpatient testing, make definitive diagnoses, and improve timely linkage to ART. Scale-up plans should prioritize pediatric wards. ","164":"South Africa is experiencing colliding epidemics of HIV\/AIDS and noncommunicable diseases. In response, the National Department of Health has implemented integrated chronic disease management aimed at strengthening primary health care (PHC) facilities to manage chronic illnesses. However, chronic care is still fragmented. This study explored how the health system functions to care for patients with comorbid type 2 diabetes (T2DM) and HIV\/AIDS at a tertiary hospital in Soweto, South Africa. We employed ethnographic methods encompassing clinical observations and qualitative interviews with health care providers at the hospital (n=30). Data were transcribed verbatim and thematically analyzed using QSR NVivo 12 software. Health systemic challenges such as the lack of medication, untrained nurses, and a limited number of doctors at PHC clinics necessitated patient referrals to a tertiary hospital. At the hospital, patients with T2DM were managed first at the medical outpatient clinic before they were referred to a specialty clinic. Those with comorbidities attended different clinics at the hospital partly due to the structure of the tertiary hospital that offers specialized care. In addition, little to no collaboration occurred among health care providers due to poor communication, noncentralized patient information, and staff shortage. As a result, patients experienced disjointed care. PHC clinics in Soweto need to be strengthened by training nurses to diagnose and manage patients with T2DM and also by ensuring adequate medical supplies. We recommend that the medical outpatient clinic at a tertiary hospital should also be strengthened to offer integrated and collaborative care to patients with T2DM and other comorbidities. Addressing key systemic challenges such as staff shortages and noncentralized patient information will create a patient-centered as opposed to disease-specific approach to care. ","165":"","166":"Oxygen therapy is an essential medicine and core component of effective hospital systems. However, many hospitals in low- and middle-income countries lack reliable oxygen access-a deficiency highlighted and exacerbated by the coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic. Oxygen access can be challenged by equipment that is low quality and poorly maintained, lack of clinical and technical training and protocols, and deficiencies in local infrastructure and policy environment. We share learnings from 2 decades of oxygen systems work with hospitals in Africa and the Asia-Pacific regions, highlighting practical actions that hospitals can take to immediately expand oxygen access. These include strategies to: (1) improve pulse oximetry and oxygen use, (2) support biomedical engineers to optimize existing oxygen supplies, and (3) expand on existing oxygen systems with robust equipment and smart design. We make all our resources freely available for use and local adaptation.","167":"The 2015-2016 Zika virus outbreak in Brazil was unprecedented and resulted in the birth of more than 3,000 children with congenital Zika syndrome (CZS). These children experience multiple complex health conditions and have limited services to support them and their family's needs. An existing family support program for children with cerebral palsy (Getting to Know Cerebral Palsy) was adapted to the Zika context in Brazil through expert consultation. The program was pilot tested at 2 sites among 6 groups of caregivers (total of 48 families) from August 2017 to June 2018. Group observation and focus group discussions with facilitators and participants at the end of each session informed fast-track learning, which was used to tailor the program for future groups. Fast-track learning-adjusting the intervention in real time based on gathered feedback-was found to be a helpful process to inform and hone the program from its initial concept. The intervention, Juntos, is a facilitated participatory group program for caregivers of children who have CZS. The group sessions are cofacilitated by a parent of a child who has CZS and an allied health professional. The group meets for 10 sessions that last 4 hours. Each session includes an icebreaker, activities, and group discussions. Content covers practical information on caring for a child with a developmental disability including that caused by Zika. Psychosocial support forms an important component, and families are guided from the first week to define and develop their own communities of support. Six pilot groups were successfully run in Rio de Janeiro and Greater Salvador, Bahia. The groups gave positive feedback on acceptability and demand. The program has the potential to be an important tool for community health and social support services in South America in response to Zika. The program can also be applied to children with neurodevelopmental disabilities other than those caused by the Zika virus, which could be important in ensuring families of children with CZS are less isolated. ","168":"Pediatric early warning (PEW) scores represent a \"track-and-trigger system\" that identifies clinical deterioration in a patient's condition in the hours preceding a sentinel event. Before implementation, nurses reported feeling unprepared to identify and advocate for acutely ill patients owing to a lack of skills, vocabulary, and agency. We implemented a Pediatric Early Warning Score for Resource-Limited Settings (PEWS-RL) with nurses in a rural district hospital in Rwanda. Although PEW scores can improve clinical outcomes, empowering nurses in resource-limited settings to discuss patient acuity with physicians is a critical first step. Our primary aims were to train nurses to obtain more accurate vital signs and assess their importance as early warning signs of clinical deterioration and use PEW scores to improve communication between nurses and physicians. The PEWS-RL tool implementation began with a training program that was created through discussions with nurses, physicians, and the medical director of the hospital. The program included lectures and application of learned skills through direct clinical mentorship of nurses, as well as training of physicians regarding PEWS-RL as a communication tool. The PEWS-RL protocol was evaluated based on pre- and post-tests to assess improvement in nurses' knowledge and skill, as well as skills assessments of accurate recognition of clinical deterioration. All 6 nurses passed skill testing with &gt;80% accuracy. Nurses' feelings of empowerment to advocate for patients and to escalate care were assessed through pre- and post-training interviews. Nurses described increased confidence in calling for physician support. Implementation of PEW scores increased nurses' technical skills and feelings of confidence and empowerment; however, the low-resource setting presented major challenges. Barriers to sustainable implementation include the rapid ward staff turnover as well as limited physician buy-in. Nevertheless, the PEWS-RL tool has the potential to empower nurses and improve patient outcomes if fully embraced by staff. ","169":"Good-quality evidence on hand hygiene compliance among birth attendants in low-resource labor wards is limited. The World Health Organization Hand Hygiene Observation Form is widely used for directly observing behaviors, but it does not support capturing complex patterns of behavior. We developed the HANDS at Birth tool for direct observational studies of complex patterns of hand rubbing\/washing, glove use, recontamination, and their determinants among birth attendants. Understanding these behaviors is particularly critical in wards with variable patient volumes or unpredictable patient complications, such as emergency departments, operating wards, or triage and isolation wards during epidemics. Here we provide detailed information on the design and implementation of the HANDS at Birth tool, with a particular focus on low-resource settings. We developed the HANDS at Birth tool from available guidelines, unstructured observation, and iterative refinement based on consultation with collaborators and pilot results. We designed the tool with WOMBAT software, which supports collecting multidimensional time-and-motion data. Our analysis of the tool's performance centered on interobserver agreement and convergent validity and the implications of the data structure for data analysis. The HANDS at Birth tool encompasses various hand actions and context-relevant information. Hand actions include procedures relevant during labor and delivery; hand hygiene or glove actions; and other types of touch. During field implementation, we used the tool for continuous observation of the birth attendant. Interobserver agreement was good (kappa range: 0.7-0.9), and the tool showed convergent validity. Using the HANDS at Birth tool is a feasible way to obtain useful information about compliance with hand hygiene procedures. The tool could be used after simple training and allows for collection of reliable information about the complex pattern of hygiene behaviors. Future studies should explore using this tool to observe behavior in labor wards in other settings and in other types of wards.","170":"mHealth interventions are being tested to improve contraceptive uptake in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs); however, the effectiveness of these interventions has not been systematically reviewed. The primary objective of this systematic review was to assess the effectiveness of mHealth interventions to improve contraceptive uptake and adherence in LMICs. A second objective was to identify mHealth features and behavior change communication components used in these mHealth interventions. A systematic search was conducted of online databases for peer-reviewed articles that reported on intervention studies with men and women from LMICs and measured mHealth intervention impact on contraceptive uptake and\/or adherence. Key search terms included \"mHealth\" or \"mobile health,\" \"contraception\" or \"family planning,\" and \"low- and middle-income countries.\" PRISMA guidelines were followed for reporting review methods and findings. The Cochrane risk-of-bias 2 tool for randomized trials was used to assess the risk of bias of the included studies. The GRADE approach was used to determine the quality of evidence. Eight randomized controlled trial studies met the inclusion criteria. Four studies experienced implementation challenges (e.g., intervention components were not utilized fully by participants, intervention participants did not receive the full intervention content, contamination, low response rate, and\/or missing data). Only 3 interventions were found to be effective, and these included a \"push\" approach, interactive communication, information tailored to participants, motivational messaging, and male partner involvement. To date, the delivery of mHealth interventions for improving family planning in LMICs has met with implementation challenges that have reduced the researcher's ability to test intervention effectiveness. Although 3 of 8 studies found improved contraceptive use in the intervention group, the review cannot draw concrete conclusions on the overall effectiveness of mHealth interventions to increase contraceptive use in LMICs. Further research with robust program fidelity is recommended. ","171":"Health information systems rely on high-quality data to measure, track, and inform decision making. Currently, the quality, uptake, and use of family planning data in routine health information systems is limited, presenting an opportunity for improvement on many levels. The current synthesis assessed findings from 17 small grants that MEASURE Evaluation issued to low- and middle-income country research teams between 2015 and 2019. Main findings from that research were collaboratively categorized in 4 major themes: (1) the enabling environment for managing and using family planning information; (2) barriers to integration of family planning in routine health information systems; (3) gaps in the analysis, interpretation, and use of routine family planning data; and (4) family planning data use in management, programmatic, and budgetary decisions. Data quality at the systemic, organizational, technical, and output levels was a crosscutting theme. Collectively, the findings outline barriers to and opportunities for improved integration of family planning data and subsequent strengthening of routine health information systems.","172":"Reproductive health programs for youth have largely overlooked first-time parents (FTPs)-defined as young women younger than 25 years old who are pregnant or already have 1 child, and their partners. To address this gap, we implemented and evaluated a program to improve child spacing, modern contraceptive use, and related gender outcomes among FTPs in Cross River State (CRS), Nigeria. This paper examines the effectiveness of FTP interventions in improving voluntary uptake of contraception. We conducted small group sessions and home visits with FTPs from May to August 2018 in 2 local government areas of CRS. A pretest-posttest study examined the effectiveness of these interventions regarding healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy\/family planning knowledge, attitudes, intentions, communication, decision making, and contraceptive use. We performed a bivariate analysis and logistic binomial regression to confirm change over time in the primary study outcome, current use of a modern method of contraception. We also performed analysis of demographic characteristics and secondary outcomes (e.g., birth spacing intentions and couple communication). We interviewed 338 participating first-time mothers (FTMs) and 224 participating partners at baseline and endline. Important indicators of contraceptive awareness, attitudes, and couples' communication increased significantly from baseline to endline. Voluntary current modern contraceptive use increased from 26% to 79% among nonpregnant FTMs (P&lt;.000), and from 44% to 81% among partners (P&lt;.000). After controlling for significant factors related to family planning use, FTMs were 3.3 times more likely (P&lt;.001) and partners 3.7 times more likely (P&lt;.000) to be using a modern contraceptive method at endline. Program participation was associated with significant improvements in voluntary uptake of modern contraceptive methods and multiple secondary outcomes. Even within a short timeframe, this intensive, multi-intervention effort achieved significant advancements across healthy timing and spacing of pregnancy and family planning outcomes for this vulnerable youth population. ","173":"As global health programs have become increasingly complex, corresponding evaluations must be designed to assess the full complexity of these programs. Gavi and the Global Fund have commissioned 2 such evaluations to assess the full spectrum of their investments using a prospective mixed-methods approach. We aim to describe lessons learned from implementing these evaluations. This article presents a synthesis of lessons learned based on the Gavi and Global Fund prospective mixed-methods evaluations, with each evaluation considered a case study. The lessons are based on the evaluation team's experience from over 7 years (2013-2020) implementing these evaluations. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Framework for Evaluation in Public Health was used to ground the identification of lessons learned. We identified 5 lessons learned that build on existing evaluation best practices and include a mix of practical and conceptual considerations. The lessons cover the importance of (1) including an inception phase to engage stakeholders and inform a relevant, useful evaluation design; (2) aligning on the degree to which the evaluation is embedded in the program implementation; (3) monitoring programmatic, organizational, or contextual changes and adapting the evaluation accordingly; (4) hiring evaluators with mixed-methods expertise and using tools and approaches that facilitate mixing methods; and (5) contextualizing recommendations and clearly communicating their underlying strength of evidence. Global health initiatives, particularly those leveraging complex interventions, should consider embedding evaluations to understand how and why the programs are working. These initiatives can learn from the lessons presented here to inform the design and implementation of such evaluations. ","174":"Effective and efficient health supply chains play a vital role in achieving health outcomes by ensuring supplies are available for people to access quality health services. However, supplying health commodities to service delivery points is complex and costly in many low- and middle-income countries. Thus, governments and partner organizations are often interested in understanding how to design their health supply chains more cost efficiently.Several modeling tools exist in the public and private market that can help assess supply chain efficiency and identify supply chain design improvements. These tools are generally capable of providing users with very precise cost estimates, but they often use proprietary software and require detailed data inputs. This can result in a somewhat lengthy and expensive analysis process, which may be prohibitive for many decision makers, especially in the early stages of a supply chain design process. For many use cases, such as advocacy, informing workshop and technical meetings, and narrowing down initial design options, decision makers may often be willing to trade some detail and accuracy in exchange for quicker and lower-cost analysis results. To our knowledge, there are no publicly available tools focused on generating quick, high-level estimates of the cost and efficiency of different supply chain designs.To address this gap, we designed and tested an Excel-based Rapid Supply Chain Modeling (RSCM) Tool. Our assessment indicated that, despite requiring significantly less data, the RSCM Tool can generate cost estimates that are similar to other common analysis and modeling methods. Furthermore, to better understand how the RSCM Tool aligns with real-world processes and decision-making timelines, we used it to inform an ongoing immunization supply chain redesign in Angola. For the use cases described above we believe that the RSCM Tool addresses an important need for quicker and less expensive ways to identify more cost-efficient supply chain designs.","175":"Community health workers (CHWs) are increasingly deployed to support mothers' adoption of healthy home practices in low- and middle-income countries. However, little is known regarding how best to train them for the capabilities and cultural competencies needed to support maternal health behavior change. We tested a CHW training method, Sharing Histories (SH), in which CHWs recount their own childbearing and childrearing experiences on which to build new learning. We conducted an embedded cluster-randomized trial in rural Peru in 18 matched clusters. Each cluster was a primary health facility catchment area. Government health staff trained female CHWs using SH (experimental clusters) or standard training methods (control clusters). All other training and system-strengthening interventions were equal between study arms. All CHWs conducted home visits with pregnant women and children aged 0-23 months to teach, monitor health practices and danger signs, and refer. The primary outcome was height-for-age (HAZ)&lt;-2 Z-scores (stunting) in children aged 0-23 months. Household surveys were conducted at baseline (606 cases) and 4-year follow-up (606 cases). Maternal and child characteristics were similar in both study arms at baseline and follow-up. Difference-in-differences analysis showed mean HAZ changes were not significantly different in experimental versus control clusters from baseline to endline (P=.469). However, in the subgroup of literate mothers, mean HAZ improved by 1.03 on the Z-score scale in experimental clusters compared to control clusters from baseline to endline (P=.059). Using generalized estimating equations, we demonstrated that stunting in children of mothers who were literate was significantly reduced (Beta=0.77; 95% confidence interval=0.23, 1.31; P&lt;.01), adjusting for covariates. Compared with standard training methods, SH may have improved the effectiveness of CHWs as change agents among literate mothers to reduce child stunting. Stunting experienced by the children of illiterate mothers may have involved unaddressed determinants of stunting. ","176":"Childhood anemia remains a significant driver of morbidity in low- and middle-income countries, including Peru. To identify behavioral challenges to using micronutrient powder (MNP) that is given to supplement children's diets and prevent anemia, we applied a behavioral design approach to interviews and focus groups with 129 caregivers in Arequipa, Peru. We examined 3 key points in the decision-making process: accessing MNP through the health system; forming intentions to use MNP; and MNP use at the time of child feeding. Using the NUDGE (Narrow, Understand, Discover, Generate, Evaluate) approach, we identified the following behavioral barriers and facilitators: (1) caregivers' experiences with health care providers shaped their motivation to access MNP; (2) caregivers felt accessing MNP at clinics was inconvenient and created hassle factors; (3) caregivers' mental models about anemia prevention shaped MNP intentions and use; (4) caregivers' salient negative experiences could have caused them to stop giving MNP; (5) caregivers forgot to give MNP if they did not have cues to remind them but could be prompted with salient cues; and (6) caregivers were affected by emotional, cognitive, and attentional factors during feeding that were difficult to anticipate. Our results, based on a behavioral design approach, suggest opportunities to adapt current messaging, counseling, and education around MNP use. Adaptations include providing culturally relevant messages, leveraging caregivers' emotional and cognitive states, and encouraging small but impactful changes to feeding routines to address barriers to MNP use.","177":null,"178":null,"179":"Limited information exists on health care workers' (HCWs) perceptions about use of multidose vaccine vials and their preferences about doses per container (DPC). We present findings from qualitative studies conducted in Senegal, Vietnam, and Zambia to explore HCWs' behavior regarding opening vials and their perceptions and preferences for the number of doses in vials of BCG and measles-containing vaccine (MCV). Zambia and Senegal currently offer MCV in 10-dose vials and BCG in 20-dose vials; 10-dose vials are used for both vaccines in Vietnam. Unused doses in vials of these reconstituted vaccines must be discarded within 6 hours. Key informant interviews (KIIs) were conducted with frontline HCWs in Senegal, Vietnam, and Zambia. In Senegal and Vietnam, the KIIs were conducted as part of broader formative research; in Zambia, KIIs were conducted in control districts using 10-dose MCV vials only and in intervention districts that switched from 10- to 5-dose vials during the study. During analysis, themes common to all 3 countries were synthesized. Critical themes relevant to country contexts were also examined. HCWs in all 3 countries preferred containers with fewer doses for BCG and MCV to reduce wastage and increase the likelihood of vaccinating every eligible child. HCWs in Senegal and HCWs using 10-dose vials in Zambia reported sending unvaccinated children away because not enough children were present to warrant opening a new vial. In Vietnam, where sessions are typically held monthly, and in Zambia when the 5-dose vials were used, almost all HCWs reported opening a vial of MCV for even 1 child. HCWs prefer vials with fewer DPC. Their concerns about balancing coverage and wastage influence their decisions to vaccinate every eligible child; and their perspectives are crucial to ensuring that all target populations are reached with vaccines in a timely manner. ","180":"Improving contraceptive method choice is a goal of international family planning. Method mix-the percentage distribution of total contraceptive use across various methods-reflects both supply (availability of affordable methods) and demand (client preferences). We analyze changes in method mix, regional contrasts, and the relationship of the mix to contraceptive prevalence. We use 789 national surveys from the 1960s through 2019, from 113 developing countries with at least 1 million people and with data on use of 8 contraceptive methods. Two measures assess the \"evenness\" of the mix: method skew (more than 50% use is by 1 method), and the average deviation (AD) of the 8 methods' shares from their mean value. Population weighted and unweighted results are compared because they can differ substantially. Use of traditional methods has declined but still represents 11% of all use (population weighted) or 17% (unweighted country average). Vasectomy's share was historically low with the exception of a few countries but is now even lower. The previous trend toward greater overall evenness in the mix has slowed recently. Sub-Saharan Africa shows a hormonal method progression from oral contraceptives to injectables to implants in a substantial number of countries. In some countries with high HIV prevalence, the condom share has increased. The leading method's share differs by region: female sterilization in Asia (39%) and in Latin America (31%), the pill in the Middle East\/North Africa (32%), and the injectable in sub-Saharan Africa (36%). Method skew persists in 30% of countries. \"Evenness\" of mix is not related to contraceptive prevalence. The marked diversity in predominant methods underscores the conclusion that no single method mix is ideal or appropriate everywhere. But that diversity across countries, coupled with the persisting high degree of extreme skewness in many of them, argues for continued concerted efforts for programs to increase method choice. ","181":"Improving reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health (RMNCH) care services is imperative for reducing maternal and child mortality. Many low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) are striving to achieve RMNCH-related Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We monitored progress, made projections, and calculated the average annual rate of change needed to achieve universal (100%) access of RMNCH service indicators by 2030. We extracted Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data of 75 LMICs to estimate the coverage of RMNCH indicators and composite coverage index (CCI) to measure health system strengths. Bayesian linear regression models were fitted to predict the coverage of indicators and the probability of achieving targets. The projection analysis included 64 countries with available information for at least 2 DHS rounds. No countries are projected to reach universal CCI by 2030; only Brazil, Cambodia, Colombia, Honduras, Morocco, and Sierra Leone will have more than 90% CCI. None of the LMICs will achieve universal coverage of all RMNCH indicators by 2030, although some may achieve universal coverage for specific services. To meet targets for universal service access by 2030, most LMICs must attain a 2-fold increase in the coverage of indicators from 2019 to 2030. Coverage of RMNCH indicators, the probability of target attainments, and the required rate of increase vary significantly across the spectrum of sociodemographic disadvantages. Most countries with poor historical and current trends for RMNCH coverage are likely to experience a similar scenario in 2030. Countries with lower coverage had higher disparities across the subgroups of wealth, place of residence, and women's\/mother's education and age; these disparities are projected to persist in 2030. None of the LMICs will meet the SDG RMNCH 2030 targets without scaling up essential RMNCH interventions, reducing gaps in coverage, and reaching marginalized and disadvantaged populations. ","182":"The coronavirus disease (COVID-19) pandemic poses a grave threat to refugees and internally displaced persons (IDPs). We examined knowledge, attitudes, and practices with respect to COVID-19 prevention among IDPs in war-torn Eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Mixed-methods study with qualitative (focus group discussions, [FGDs]) and quantitative (52-item survey questionnaire) data collection and synthesis. FGDs (N=23) and survey questionnaires (N=164 IDPs; N=143 comparison group) were conducted in May 2020. FGD participants provided narratives of violence that they had fled. IDPs were statistically more likely to have larger household size, experience more extreme poverty, have lower educational attainment, and have less access to information through media and internet versus the comparison group (P&lt;.05 for the comparison group). IDPs had a high level of awareness (99%) and fear (98%) of COVID-19, but lower specific knowledge (15% sufficient knowledge versus 30% among the comparison group, P&lt;.0001), a difference which remained significant in a multivariable model adjusting for confounding. IDPs faced major barriers to implementing COVID-19 prevention measures. Physical distancing was impossible for IDPs in crowded shelters, and 70% reported coming in close contact with someone other than a family member within the past 24 hours (versus 56% of the comparison group, P=.014). Frequent movements in and out of the camp for subsistence left IDPs vulnerable to the introduction of COVID-19: 61% left the camp on a daily basis and 65% had received a visitor in the past month. Despite acceptance of hand hygiene for prevention, 92% lacked soap (versus 65% of the comparison group, P&lt;.0001). IDPs' desire for peace and to return to their native homes, where COVID-19 precautions could be feasibly implemented, overshadowed their perceived benefits of measures such as a COVID-19 vaccine. These findings provide empiric evidence supporting the vulnerability of IDPs to COVID-19 and call for action to protect neglected displaced populations.

They can be used by health professionals in any specialty and in a multitude of settings. This study reviews implementation strategies and lessons learned in a capacity-building program that took place with pediatric physiotherapists in Rwanda. Use of PROMs and patient-centered practice were integrated into 4 consecutive continuing professional development courses offered to 164 participants in Rwanda. We sought to identify a simple generic measure with proven validity in cross-cultural settings. The Patient-Specific Functional Scale was chosen due to its ease of use and ability to measure change in a wide range of patient conditions. Didactic classroom training and clinical site visits were 2 essential pedagogical elements of the capacity-building strategy. Site visits allowed for evaluation of skill levels and facilitation of knowledge transfer to patient care settings. Unique pairs of Rwandan colleagues were trained to serve as coteachers in each course to maximize sustainability of new techniques. This study presents data on a subset of 65 participants who completed a 48-hour pediatric rehabilitation course. After classroom instruction, 78% of participants were observed independently determining functional limitations with their patients. Additionally, pre- and post-tests indicated that therapists substantially increased their understanding of patient-centered practice after attending courses. Interviews conducted 26 months after the conclusion of the project revealed mixed success in sustainability of the use of PROMs, although perceived confidence remained high. Challenges in long-term sustainability of new practices call attention to the need to target not only clinicians when introducing new methodologies, but also the Ministry of Health, hospital administration, and university faculty. Lessons learned from this study may be useful to other medical professionals planning capacity-building programs in low- and middle-income countries. ","189":"As the current COVID-19 pandemic illustrates, not all hospitals and other patient care facilities are equipped with enough personal protective equipment to meet the demand in a crisis. Health care workers around the world use filtering facepiece respirators to protect themselves and their patients, yet during this global pandemic they are forced to reuse what are intended to be single-use masks. This poses a significant risk to these health care workers along with the people they are trying to protect. Ultraviolet germicidal irradiation (UVGI) has been validated previously as a method to effectively decontaminate these masks between use. However, not all facilities have access to the expensive commercial ultraviolet type C (UV-C) lamp decontamination equipment required for UVGI. UV-C bulbs are sitting idle in biosafety cabinets at universities and research facilities around the world that have been shuttered to slow the spread of COVID-19. These bulbs may also be available in existing medical centers where infectious diseases are commonly treated. We developed a method to modify existing light fixtures or create custom light fixtures that are compatible with new or existing UV-C bulbs. This system is scalable; can be created for less than US$50, on site and at the point of need; and leverages resources that are currently untapped and sitting unused in public and private research facilities during the pandemic. The freely accessible design can be easily modified for use around the world. Health care facilities can obtain this potentially lifesaving UVGI resource with minimal funds by collaborating with research facilities to obtain the UV-C meters and UV-C bulbs if they are unavailable from other sources. Although mask reuse is not ideal, we must do what we can in emergency situations to protect our health care workers responding to the pandemic and the communities they serve.","190":"Health service delivery indicators are designed to reveal how well health services meet a community's needs. Effective use of the data can enable targeted improvements in health service delivery. We conducted a systematic review to identify the factors that influence the use of health service delivery indicators to improve delivery of primary health care services in low- and middle-income settings. We reviewed empirical studies published in 2005 or later that provided evidence on the use of health service delivery data at the primary care level in low- and middle-income countries. We searched Scopus, Medline, the Cochrane Library, and citations of included studies. We also searched the gray literature, using a separate strategy. We extracted information on study design, setting, study population, study objective, key findings, and any identified lessons learned. Twelve studies met the inclusion criteria. This small number of studies suggests there is insufficient evidence to draw reliable conclusions. However, a content analysis identified the following potentially influential factors, which we classified into 3 categories: governance (leadership, participatory monitoring, regular review of data); production of information (presentation of findings, data quality, qualitative data); and health information system resources (electronic health management information systems, organizational structure, training). Contextual factors and performance-based financing were also each found to have a role; however, discussing these as mediating factors may not be practical in terms of promoting data use. Scant evidence exists regarding factors that influence the use of health service delivery indicators to improve delivery of primary health care services in low- and middle-income countries. However, the existing evidence highlights some factors that may have a role in improving data use. Further research may benefit from comparing data use factors across different types of program indicators or using our classification as a framework for field experiments. ","191":"The rapid growth of point-of-care (POC) diagnostic tests necessitates a clear vision of when, where, and why a new POC diagnostic test needs to be developed and how it can be used in a way that matches a local health care context. Here, we present an innovative approach toward developing a concept target product profile (CTPP), which is a new mapping tool that helps researchers match a new diagnostic test to a specific local health care context early in the research and development process. As a case study, we focus on the diagnosis of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) in rural resource-limited regions of Kenya and Uganda. Our stepwise approach integrates elements of design thinking and uses a combination of literature reviews and field research for a context analysis of local health care systems and practices. We then use visual thinking in the form of Gigamaps and patient journeys to identify use case scenarios and to present our findings from the field research to key stakeholders. The use case scenarios describe the diagnostic scope of a new POC test based on the feasibility of the new test, the local need, and the contextual fit. For our case study of VL, we identify 2 valuable use case scenarios, namely test-of-cure and screening and confirmation, and we formulate a CTPP. We anticipate that a CTPP will enable researchers to match a new POC diagnostic test during the research and development process to the local health care context in which it will be used.","192":"In Mozambique, more than a million children are living with HIV or are otherwise vulnerable due to HIV. In response to this crisis, the US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief funds programs that serve orphans and vulnerable children affected by HIV and their families. These programs retain case workers, known as activistas, who provide and refer beneficiaries to services to increase beneficiaries' knowledge of their HIV status and to improve retention in care among those living with HIV. To improve program effectiveness, implementing organizations need to understand how different case management attributes affect beneficiary outcomes. We applied fuzzy-set qualitative comparative analysis (QCA), based on 119 interviews, to identify the combinations of case management attributes that led to (1) increased knowledge of HIV status, and (2) high percentages of beneficiaries with known HIV status. We identified 6 pathways for the first outcome and 5 pathways for the second outcome. Each pathway demonstrates an alternative combination of conditions that positively influences the outcome and is equally sufficient in achieving the outcome. To improve knowledge of HIV status, programs in a similar context as this study may select any of the identified pathways based on their existing resources and work on ensuring the presence of each of the conditions in the pathway. Overall, based on the presence of some of the factors in multiple pathways, we conclude that to improve knowledge of HIV status it is important that programs implement a formal process to assign cases considering case complexity and existing caseload to reduce overwork; provide activistas with external support such as weekly care team meetings, weekly supervisor meetings, and\/or low supervision ratios; hire experienced activistas; provide all activistas with follow-up trainings so they have the tools to address challenging cases; expand the financial resources offered to activistas; and reimburse activistas for work-related expenses.","193":"Pneumonia, diarrhea, and malaria are leading causes of under-5 mortality. Accelerated reductions in illness burden are needed to meet childhood Sustainable Development Goals. Understand-ing where parents take sick children for care is key to improving equitable, high-quality treatment for these childhood illnesses and catalyzing reductions in morbidity and mortality. We analyzed the most recent Demographic and Health Survey data in 24 of the United States Agency for International Development's maternal and child health priority countries to examine levels and sources of care for children sick with 3 illness classifications: symptoms of acute respiratory infection, diarrhea, or fever. On average, across countries analyzed, one-third of children had recent experience with at least 1 of the 3 classifications. The majority (68.2%) of caregivers sought external advice or treatment for their sick children, though the level is far higher for the wealthiest (74.3%) than poorest (63.1%) families. Among those who sought out-of-home care, 51.1% used public sources and 42.5% used private-sector sources. Although sources for sick child care varied substantially by region and country, they were consistent across the 3 illness classifications. Urban and wealthier families reported more use of private sources compared with rural and poorer families. Though 35.2% of the poorest families used private sources, most of these (57.2%) were retail outlets like pharmacies and shops, while most wealthier families who sought care in the private sector went to health facilities (62.4%). Efforts to strengthen the quality of integrated management of sick child care must therefore reach both public and private facilities as well as private pharmacies, shops, and other retail outlets. Stakeholders across sectors must collaborate to reach all population groups with high-quality child health services and reduce disparities in care-seeking behaviors. Such cross-sectoral efforts will build clinical and institutional capacity and more efficiently allocate resources, ultimately resulting in stronger, more resilient health systems.","194":"As more countries transition from paper-based to electronic immunization registries (EIRs) to collect and track individual immunization data, guidance is needed for successful adoption and use of these systems. Little research is available on the determinants of EIR use soon after introduction. This observational study assesses the determinants of facility health care workers' use of new EIRs in Tanzania and Zambia, implemented during 2016 to 2018. We used EIR data entered between 2016 and 2018 from 3 regions in Tanzania and 1 province in Zambia to measure weekly EIR system use for a total of 50,639 facility-weeks. We joined secondary data on facility characteristics and applied the Performance of Routine Information System Management framework to categorize characteristics as organizational, technical, or behavioral. We used a generalized estimating equations logistic regression model to assess facility characteristics as potential determinants of system use. In both countries, the estimated odds of weekly EIR use declined weekly after EIR introduction. In Tanzania, health centers and hospitals had increased odds of system use compared to dispensaries. For each additional health care worker trained in a facility during the EIR introduction, the estimated odds of weekly EIR use increased. Tanzanian facilities that had transitioned entirely to paperless reporting had higher odds of sustained use compared to those maintaining parallel electronic and paper-based reporting systems. In Zambia, distance from the district health office was significantly associated with decreasing odds of system use. There were significant differences in EIR use by district in both countries. The results highlight the importance of organizational and behavioral factors in explaining sustained EIR use. As EIRs are introduced in new settings, we recommend indicators of engagement and use be built directly into the system so they can be routinely monitored, and course corrections can be implemented as needed. ","195":"Quality of care is an important element in health care service delivery in low- and middle-income countries. Innovative strategies are critical to ensure that private providers implement quality of care interventions. We explored private providers' experiences implementing a package of interventions intended to improve the quality of care in small and medium-sized private health facilities in Kenya. Data were collected as part of the qualitative evaluation of the African Health Markets for Equity (AHME) program in Kenya between June and July 2018. Private providers were purposively selected from 2 social franchise networks participating in AHME: the Amua network run by Marie Stopes Kenya and the Tunza network run by Population Services Kenya. Individual interviews (N=47) were conducted with providers to learn about their experiences with a package of interventions that included social franchising, SafeCare (a quality improvement program), National Hospital Insurance Fund (NHIF) accreditation assistance, and business support. Private providers felt they benefited from trainings in clinical methods and quality improvement offered through AHME. Providers especially appreciated the mentorship and guidelines offered through programs like social franchising and SafeCare, and those who received support for NHIF accreditation felt they were able to offer higher quality services after going through this process. However, quality improvement was sometimes prohibitively expensive for private providers in smaller facilities that already realize relatively low revenue and the NHIF accreditation process was difficult to navigate without the help of the AHME partners due to complexity and a lack of transparency. Our findings suggest that engaging private providers in a comprehensive package of quality improvement activities is achievable and may be preferable to a simpler program. However, further research that looks at the implications for cost and return on investment is required. ","196":"With increasing interest in strengthening community health programs nationally comes a need for operationalizing them in a realistic and achievable way. Limited information is available to help program managers establish appropriate parameters for their context. We examined aspects of program implementation related to deployment patterns of community health workers, called agents communautaires or ACs, in 2 districts of Madagascar. By analyzing program data and publicly available datasets in a geographic information system (GIS), we estimated the population and surface area coverage expected of ACs in 445 fokontany (communities). Additional modeling on travel time demands examined 1-way pedestrian travel time for ACs to receive routine support from their assigned health facilities and from socially marketed supply points under dry season conditions, as well as the impact on travel time based on ACs being reassigned to other facilities or supply points. With the current distribution, ACs in 90% of fokontany have a catchment population of 1,000 or fewer people (2020 estimates) and ACs in 84% of fokontany have a catchment area of 25 km2 or less. We estimated that ACs in 58% of fokontany were located more than 2 hours from their supporting health facility, and the proportion of fokontany with ACs more than 2 hours away from their assigned supply point was 61%. Reassigning ACs to the closest facility or supply point led to modest improvements in those figures (7 and 4 percentage points, respectively). Findings allow visualizing the practical implications of coverage ratios for ACs to assess whether current demands are realistic. The physical access between ACs and the health system warrants significant attention due to challenges in transport and logistics. Analyses are timely to inform the Ministry of Public Health's strategic thinking in the context of the development of the National Strategic Plan on Strengthening Community Health. ","197":"The quality of contraceptive counseling that women receive from their provider can influence their future contraceptive continuation. We examined (1) whether the quality of contraceptive service provision could be measured in a consistent way by using existing tools from 2 large-scale social franchises, and (2) whether facility quality measures based on these tools were consistently associated with contraceptive discontinuation. We linked existing, routinely collected facility audit data from social franchise clinics in Pakistan and Uganda with client data. Clients were women aged 15-49 who initiated a modern, reversible contraceptive method from a sampled clinic. Consented participants completed an exit interview and were contacted 3, 6, and 12 months later. We collapsed indicators into quality domains using theory-based categorization, created summative quality domain scores, and used Cox proportional hazards models to estimate the relationship between these quality domains and discontinuation while in need of contraception. The 12-month all-modern method discontinuation rate was 12.5% among the 813 enrolled women in Pakistan and 5.1% among the 1,185 women in Uganda. We did not observe similar associations between facility-level quality measures and discontinuation across these 2 settings. In Pakistan, an increase in the structural privacy domain was associated with a 60% lower risk of discontinuation, adjusting for age and baseline method (P&lt;.001). In Uganda, an increase in the management support domain was associated with a 33% reduction in discontinuation risk, controlling for age and baseline method (P=.005). We were not able to leverage existing, widely used quality measurement tools to create quality domains that were consistently associated with discontinuation in 2 study settings. Given the importance of contraceptive service quality and recent advances in indicator standardization in other areas, we recommend further effort to harmonize and simplify measurement tools to measure and improve contraceptive quality of care for all. ","198":"Track and trace systems are increasingly being implemented as a technological solution to secure pharmaceutical supply chains. Turkey was the first country to implement a full pharmaceutical track and trace system throughout the entire regulated domestic supply chain. This article explores the emergence and functioning of this system and the consequences for substandard and falsified medicine with a focus on the underlying political and economic factors. This study uses an explanatory case study approach that combined interviews with purposefully selected key informants and document analyses. The main drivers for implementing the pharmaceutical track and trace system in Turkey centered on the elimination of reimbursement fraud and the prevention of falsified medicine in the regulated supply chain. Although stakeholders experienced both physical and software-related problems in implementation, the alignment of incentives of all stakeholders with the power of the state, along with leeway for adaptations, ultimately resulted in a successful process. This track and trace system provides a clean regulated supply chain, minimizes reimbursement fraud, facilitates fast market recalls, and can flag likely medicine shortages. Staff previously engaged in pharmacy inspections now concentrate on ensuring production quality, which reduces the risk of substandard medicines. In Turkey, 4 factors drove the successful implementation of pharmaceutical track and trace: the political determination to eliminate reimbursement fraud, a large pharmaceutical market dominated by a single payer, medicine reimbursement being contingent on verified dispensing and prescription, and flexibility to adapt the system according to the needs of stakeholders during implementation. ","199":"Recommendations for antenatal calcium supplementation to prevent preeclampsia could substantially reduce maternal mortality, but adherence to multiple daily doses may constrain effectiveness. World Health Organization guidelines recommend 3 daily calcium supplements (1.5-2 g\/d), taken separately from 1 iron-folic acid (IFA) supplement; however, limited data suggest lower calcium doses may also be effective. We conducted mixed-methods household trials to identify strategies for supporting adherence and integrating calcium into antenatal IFA supplementation programming in Ethiopia. Participants were randomly assigned to 3 regimens varying in dose and timing and were later given a choice of regimens. Semistructured interviews conducted over 6 weeks explored acceptability, barriers, and facilitators and offered opportunities to choose calcium pill type. Interviews were transcribed, translated, and analyzed thematically. Calcium adherence was measured using medication event monitoring. All participants (N=48) agreed to try supplementation. Adherence barriers included forgetting to take pills when busy or travelling and perceived side effects. Midday doses were the most challenging because of farming, market, and social events; women avoided taking supplements in public due to fear of being perceived as HIV positive. Social support from families, visual reminders, and anticipated benefits motivated adherence. More participants (75%) selected chewable versus conventional supplements due to organoleptic properties, but this preference declined over time. Adherence rates did not substantially differ across regimens with 2 (81.1%), 3 (83.4%), or 4 (77.1%) pill-taking events. Women indicated that the 2-event regimen was more acceptable than 3- and 4-event regimens, but this acceptability was not associated with higher adherence. Consequently, mean daily calcium consumption (811.3 mg) was lower than for 3-event (1,251.1 mg) and 4-event (1,156.4 mg) regimens. Integrating calcium into antenatal IFA supplementation is acceptable to Ethiopian women, with a 3-event regimen yielding the highest consumption rates. Despite women experiencing challenges with midday dosing and stigma, using simple home-based strategies and being counseled on the purpose of supplementation were more effective than reducing dosage for mitigating barriers and improving adherence.","200":"This article assesses the CORE Group Polio Project (CGPP) experience over a 20-year period in 5 countries. It examines how a program designed to provide social mobilization to eradicate one disease, and which did so effectively, functioned within the general framework of community health workers (CHWs). Vertical health programs often have limited impact on broader community health. CGPP has a 20-year history of social mobilization and effective program interventions. This history provided an opportunity to assess how CGPP community mobilizers (CMs) functioned in polio and maternal and child health. The Updated Program Functionality Matrix for Optimizing Community Health Programs tool of the CHW Assessment and Improvement Matrix (AIM) was used to examine CGPP CM roles across different contexts. The analysis determined that CGPP CMs met the basic level of functioning (level 3) for 6 of the 10 components of the AIM tool. This cross-country descriptive analysis of the CGPP demonstrates the importance of embracing the full range of CHW AIM components, even in a vertical program. Use of data, community involvement, local adaptation, and linkage with the health system are especially critical for success. This general lesson could be applied to other community mobilization and disease\/epidemic control initiatives, especially as we face the issues of the COVID-19 pandemic.","201":"Community health workers (CHWs) play a key role in the health of mothers and newborns in low- and middle-income countries. However, it remains unclear by what actions and messages CHWs enable good outcomes and respectful care. We collected a uniquely linked set of questions on behaviors, beliefs, and care pathways from recently delivered women (n=5,469), their husbands (n=3,064), mothers-in-law (n=3,626), and CHWs (accredited social health activists; n=1,052) in Uttar Pradesh, India. We used logistic regression to study associations between CHW actions and household behaviors during antenatal, delivery, and postnatal periods. Pregnant women who were visited earlier in pregnancy and who received multiple visits were more likely to perform recommended health behaviors including attending multiple checkups, consuming iron and folic acid tablets, and delivering in a health facility (ID), compared to women visited later or receiving fewer visits, respectively. Counseling the woman was associated with higher likelihood of attending 3+ checkups and consuming 100+ iron and folic acid tablets, whereas counseling the husband and mother-in-law was associated with higher rates of ID. Certain behavior change messages, such as the danger of complications, were associated with more checkups and ID, but were only used by 50%-80% of CHWs. During delivery, 57% of women had the CHW present, and their presence was associated with respectful care, early initiation of breastfeeding, and exclusive breastfeeding, but not with delayed bathing or clean cord care. The newborn was less likely to receive delayed bathing if the CHW incorrectly believed that newborns could be bathed soon after birth (which is believed by 30% of CHWs). CHW presence was associated with health behaviors more strongly for home than facility deliveries. Home visits after delivery were associated with higher rates of clean cord care and exclusive breastfeeding. Counseling the mother-in-law (but not the husband or woman) was associated with exclusive breastfeeding. We identified potential ways in which CHW impact could be improved, specifically by emphasizing the importance of home visits, which household members are targeted during these visits, and what messages are shared. Achieving this change will require training CHWs in counseling and behavior change and providing supervision and modern tools such as apps that can help the CHW keep track of her beneficiaries, suggest behavior change strategies, and direct attention to households that stand to gain the most from support. ","202":"Ownership is an important construct of sustainability for community-based health programming, though it is often not clearly defined or measured. We implemented and evaluated a community-driven maternity waiting home (MWH) model in rural Zambia. We engaged stakeholders at all levels and provided intensive mentorship to an MWH governance committee comprised of community-selected members. We then examined how different stakeholders perceive community ownership of the MWH. We conducted 42 focus group discussions with community stakeholders (pregnant women, fathers, elders, and community health volunteers) and 161 in-depth interviews with MWH stakeholders (health facility staff, district health officials, and MWH governance committee and management unit members) at multiple time-points over 24 months. We conducted a content analysis and triangulated findings to understand community ownership of the MWH and observe changes in perceptions of ownership over time. Community members' perceptions of ownership were related to their ability to use the MWH and a responsibility toward its success. Community and MWH stakeholders described increasingly more specific responsibilities over time. Governance committee and management unit members perceived their ability to represent the community as a crucial component of their role. Multiple respondent types saw collaboration between the governance committee and the health facility staff as key to allowing the MWH to meet its goal of serving the community. The perceptions of community ownership evolved as the intervention became more established. Use of the MWH, and clear understanding of roles and responsibilities in management of the MWH, seemed to foster feelings of community ownership. To improve the sustainability of community-based maternal and child health programs, interventions should be accessible to target communities and clear roles should be established among stakeholders.

The All Babies Count (ABC) initiative was an 18-month district-wide approach designed to improve clinical and system performance across 2 rural Rwandan districts. This pre-post intervention study measured change in maternal and newborn health (MNH) quality of care and neonatal mortality. Data from the facility and community health management information system and newly introduced indicators were extracted from facility registers. Medians and interquartile ranges were calculated for the health facility to assess changes over time, and a mixed-effects logistic regression model was created for neonatal mortality. A difference-in-differences analysis was conducted to compare the change in district neonatal mortality with the rest of rural Rwanda. Improvements were seen in multiple measures of facility readiness and MNH quality of care, including antenatal care coverage, preterm labor management, and postnatal care quality. District hospital case fatality decreased, with a statistically significant reduction in district neonatal mortality (odds ratio [OR]=0.54; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.36, 0.83) and among preterm\/low birth weight neonates (OR=0.47; 95% CI=0.25, 0.90). Neonatal mortality was reduced from 30.1 to 19.6 deaths\/1,000 live births in the intervention districts and remained relatively stable in the rest of rural Rwanda (difference in differences -12.9). The ABC initiative contributed to improved MNH quality of care and outcomes in rural Rwanda. A combined clinical and health system improvement approach could be an effective strategy to improve quality and reduce neonatal mortality. ","208":"In 2009, the Government of Ethiopia initiated the implant scale-up initiative, which expanded contraceptive access by training health extension workers (HEWs) to insert single-rod etonogestrel contraceptive implants (Implanon) at rural health posts. Removals were provided by referrals to higher levels of the health system. However, little was known about whether women were getting their implants removed at the recommended 3-year postinsertion date or what barriers they faced to removal. Between June and July 2016, 1,860 Ethiopian women, who had a 1-rod etonogestrel implant inserted by either an HEW or another health care provider between 3 and 6 years prior, were surveyed. We describe the characteristics of the sample and use multivariable logistic regression to predict factors associated with keeping implants inserted beyond 3 years. Women who had received their implants from HEWs were significantly more likely to report keeping them inserted for more than 3 years (adjusted odds ratio=2.50; 95% confidence interval=1.19, 5.24), compared with those who got their implant from another health care provider. Women who reported distance to the facility or transportation as a barrier were also significantly more likely to keep their implant for more than 3 years. Married and educated women were less likely to keep their implants for an extended duration. Among women who had their implant for 3 years or less, women who had had it inserted by an HEW were significantly more likely to report that the provider was unable or refused to provide removal as a barrier. Efforts to expand lower level and community-based access to contraceptive implants that do not ensure reliable access to removals at the same level as insertions may lead to women using implants beyond the recommended duration. ","209":"Changing behaviors is usually a core component of the role of community health workers (CHWs), but little is known about the mechanisms through which they change behavior. We collected qualitative data from 8 sites in Ethiopia and northern Nigeria where CHWs were active to understand how they change newborn care behaviors. In each country, we conducted 12 narrative interviews and 12-13 in-depth interviews with recent mothers and 4 focus group discussions each with mothers, fathers, grandmothers, and CHWs. We identified 2 key mechanisms of behavior change. The first was linked to the frequency and consistency of hearing messages that led to a perception that change had occurred in community-wide behaviors, collective beliefs, and social expectations. The second was linked to trust in the CHW, obligation, and hierarchy. We found little evidence that constructs that often inform the design of counseling approaches, such as knowledge of causality and perceived risks and benefits, were mechanisms of change.","210":null,"211":"","212":"","213":"Community-based programming to promote gender equity, often delivered through community-based girl groups (CBGGs, sometimes called \"safe spaces\"), is increasing. However, evidence is weak on how CBGGs are implemented and their effect on adolescent girls' health and well-being. We conducted a comprehensive literature review to identify relevant CBGG programs. The review included programs with impact evaluations that used experimental or quasi-experimental design, data from 2 time points, control\/comparison groups, and quantitative program effects and P values. We analyzed evaluations of 30 programs (14 randomized controlled trials, 16 quasi-experimental). Although program designs varied, most programs targeted unmarried girls aged 13 to 18 years who were both in school and not in school, and who met weekly in groups of 15 to 25 girls. Nearly all programs used multisectoral approaches focusing on life skills and often economic and financial content, such as financial literacy and microsavings. Complementary activities with community members, boys, and health services were common. Across programs, evaluations reported statistically significant effects (P&lt;.05) the majority (&gt;50%) of times they measured outcomes related to gender and health attitudes and knowledge, education, psychosocial well-being, and economic and financial outcomes. Measures of outcomes related to girls' health behaviors and health status had majority null findings. CBGG program evaluations found positive effects on girl-level outcomes that are independent of external factors, like gender norm attitudes, and suboptimal performance on health behavior and health status, which rely on other people and systems. This delivery model has promise for building girls' assets. Complementary actions to engage girls' social environments and structures are needed to change behaviors and health status.

The Scale-Up Project implemented human papillomavirus (HPV) testing for cervical cancer screening within public-sector health facilities in Honduras between 2015 and 2019. Women who were HPV-positive but did not have visually confirmed cervical lesions upon visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA-negative) were instructed to return to the health center after 1 year for repeat HPV testing. The current evaluation assessed the effectiveness of recall strategies to prompt women to return for retesting. Clinic staff placed reminder phone calls and followed up with short message service (SMS) or home visits, if needed. We summarized number of contacts, type of contacts, and time elapsed until return to the clinic, and used log-binomial regression to identify factors associated with return to the clinic. We identified 558 women who were initially HPV-positive VIA-negative from 8 clinics as needing repeat HPV testing 1 year later. Mean age was 43.2 years. Nearly all women (98.6%) were successfully contacted and 75.1% completed repeat HPV testing. The majority of contacts (65.4%) were phone calls, and nearly half of women who returned to the clinic (42.9%) did so after 1 contact. Mean days between contact and presentation at the clinic was 10.7 (standard deviation: 14.7). Women who required 3 or more contacts were 21% less likely to return for repeat HPV testing (prevalence ratio: 0.79; 95% confidence interval=0.69,0.90; P&lt;.001) as compared to women who received only 1 contact. Reminder phone calls were highly successful at recalling women for HPV retesting in Honduras. This low-touch intervention should be included as part of standard follow-up to retain women throughout the continuum of cervical cancer screening and treatment.","215":"This qualitative study assessed implementation of the Postpartum Intrauterine Device (PPIUD) Initiative in Tanzania, a country with high rates of unintended pregnancy and low contraceptive prevalence. The PPIUD Initiative was implemented to reduce unmet need for contraception among new mothers through postpartum family planning counseling delivered during antenatal care and offering PPIUD insertion immediately following birth. We used the implementation outcomes framework and an ecological framework to analyze in-depth interviews with providers (N=15) and women (N=47) participating in the initiative. We applied a multistage coding protocol and used thematic content analysis to identify the factors influencing implementation. Both women and providers were enthusiastic and receptive to the PPIUD Initiative. Health system and resource constraints made adoption and fidelity to the intended intervention challenging. Many providers questioned the sustainability of the initiative, and most agreed that changes to the initiative's design (e.g., additional training opportunities, improved staffing, and availability of PPIUD supplies) would strengthen future iterations of the initiative. According to women, interpersonal aspects of care varied, with some women reporting rushed or incomplete counseling or an emphasis on the PPIUD over other methods. The perception that some providers treat older married women more favorably suggests that fidelity to the intended PPIUD Initiative was not uniformly achieved. Study findings inform initiatives seeking to develop and adopt postpartum family planning programs and enhance program implementation. A comprehensive needs assessment to evaluate feasibility and identify potential adaptations for the local context is recommended. Training and supervision to improve interpersonal aspects of care, including an emphasis on patient-centered counseling, informed choice, and respectful and nondiscriminatory service delivery should be integrated into future postpartum family planning initiatives. ","216":"Community health workers (CHWs) are essential to primary health care systems and are a cost-effective strategy to achieve the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). Nepal is strongly committed to universal health coverage and the SDGs. In 2017, the Nepal Ministry of Health and Population partnered with the nongovernmental organization Nyaya Health Nepal to pilot a program aligned with the 2018 World Health Organization guidelines for CHWs. The program includes CHWs who: (1) receive regular financial compensation; (2) meet a minimum education level; (3) are well supervised; (4) are continuously trained; (5) are integrated into local primary health care systems; (6) use mobile health tools; (7) have consistent supply chain; (8) live in the communities they serve; and (9) provide service without point-of-care user fees. The pilot model has previously demonstrated improved institutional birth rate, antenatal care completion, and postpartum contraception utilization. Here, we performed a retrospective costing analysis from July 16, 2017 to July 15, 2018, in a catchment area population of 60,000. The average per capita annual cost is US$3.05 (range: US$1.94 to US$4.70 across 24 villages) of which 74% is personnel cost. Service delivery and administrative costs and per beneficiary costs for all services are also described. To address the current discourse among Nepali policy makers at the local and federal levels, we also present 3 alternative implementation scenarios that policy makers may consider. Given the Government of Nepal's commitment to increase health care spending (US$51.00 per capita) to 7.0% of the 2030 gross domestic product, paired with recent health care systems decentralization leading to expanded fiscal space in municipalities, this CHW program provides a feasible opportunity to make progress toward achieving universal health coverage and the health-related SDGs. This costing analysis offers insights and practical considerations for policy makers and locally elected officials for deploying a CHW cadre as a mechanism to achieve the SDG targets.","217":"Access to quality removal services is a key component of informed choice in contraceptive implant use; however, limited data exist on users' access to removal services. In Ghana, implants are available across the country and are the most commonly used contraceptive method among married women. From October 2017 and January 2018, we conducted a phone survey with a stratified random sample of 1,159 women who had obtained an implant from a public-sector Ghana Health Service clinic in 2 regions and 1,073 women who had an implant inserted through Marie Stopes International Ghana (MSIG) mobile outreach in 2 other regions. We also interviewed 50 women just after receiving an implant removal from MSIG. We conducted follow-up in-depth interviews with 20 implant acceptors and 15 implant providers across the 4 study regions. More than four-fifths of women in both service delivery contexts knew that their implant could be removed before its labeled duration. Nearly half of public sector clients and one-third of outreach clients reported that their provider only told them of removal access at the place of insertion. Among women obtaining their implant in the public and outreach sectors, respectively, 32% and 21% reported ever wanting it removed and 61% and 55% who attempted removal obtained a removal on the first attempt. An additional 17% in each context were successful in having their implant removed within 1 week of the first attempt. Most women obtained removal from the same place they received their insertion (81% public, 70% outreach). Most women reported their overall removal experience was very or somewhat easy (74% public, 68% outreach). Challenges included cost, provider availability, interactions with providers, and difficult removals. Access to implant removal is not universal in Ghana. Strengthening removal services in both the public and outreach sectors is needed to ensure comprehensive access. ","218":"Several countries have adopted integrated community case management (iCCM) as a strategy for improved health service delivery in areas with poor health facility coverage. Early implementation of iCCM is often run by nongovernmental organizations financed by donors through projects. Such projects risk failure to transition into programs run by the local health system upon project closure. Engagement of subnational health authorities such as district health teams (DHTs) is essential for a smooth transition. We used a repeated qualitative study design to assess the readiness of and progress made by DHTs in institutionalizing iCCM into the functions of locally decentralized health systems in 9 western Uganda districts. Readiness data were derived from structured group interviews with DHTs before iCCM policy adoption in 2010 and again in 2015. Progressive institutionalization achievements were assessed through key informant interviews with targeted DHT members and local government district planners in the same areas. In the readiness study, DHTs expressed commitment to institutionalize iCCM into the local health system through the development of district-specific iCCM activity work plans and budgets. The DHTs further suggested that they would implement district-led training, motivation, and supervision of community health workers; procurement of iCCM medicines and supplies; and advocacy activities for inclusion of iCCM indicators into the national health information systems. After iCCM policy adoption, follow-up study data findings showed that iCCM was largely not institutionalized into the local district health system functions. The poor institutionalization was attributed to lack of stewardship on how to transition from externally supported implementation to district-led programming, conflicting guidelines on community distribution of medicines, poor community-level accountability systems, and limited decision-making autonomy at the district level. Successful institutionalization of iCCM requires local ownership with increased coordination and cooperation among governmental and nongovernmental actors at both the national and district levels.

The partnership began with 2 volume guarantee agreements that reduced the price of implants by approximately 50% and was complemented by efforts to address supply chain, service delivery, and knowledge and awareness barriers. We conducted a summative evaluation to identify key insights related to the IAP's relevance, effectiveness, and sustainability. We completed a desk review of program materials and published literature, followed by 42 in-depth interviews, including global stakeholders and country stakeholders in 3 case example countries: Kenya, Nigeria, and Uganda. The evaluation found evidence of increased access to implants including a 10-fold increase in procurement between 2010 and 2018 and an increase in prevalence of contraceptive implants during this same period. The IAP leveraged global family planning efforts taking place at the time, and its partnerships offered a business case for manufacturers to support increased access to implants. Enhanced supply chain visibility and coordination helped limit country-level stock-outs, and the IAP built on existing in-country delivery capacity. Although the IAP was able to address key challenges due to its effective collaboration and coordination at global and country levels, sustaining progress requires institutionalized mechanisms to continue global efforts and long-term assurances that the low price of implants will be maintained. Over 6 years, the IAP supported tremendous progress in increasing access to implants for women in low-income countries by building a public- and private-sector collaboration that focused on systems change in the family planning field. This partnership matched a unique response to a unique problem: building tools, systems, and capacity that can inform and support the introduction and scale-up of new and underutilized contraceptive methods.","225":"","226":"Water, sanitation, and hygiene (WASH) services are cornerstones to providing safe health care services and improving patient satisfaction and care seeking. The Clean Clinic Approach (CCA) uses a 10-step process to support health care facilities (HCFs) in making incremental, effective cleanliness and infection prevention and control (IPC) improvements, without relying on external investments. We piloted the CCA in Guatemala and assessed the extent to which it contributed to quality improvements in WASH for IPC. After developing an assessment tool tailored to the Guatemalan context, we assessed 11 HCFs in 8 technical areas and scored the facilities on 79 criteria with a total of 100 points. We conducted a baseline assessment (September to October 2018), second assessment (January 2019), and final assessment (February to March 2019). The 11 HCFs improved their average emergency\/general ward scores from 41 points at baseline to 87 points at end line, based on a 100-point scale. For delivery wards, the scores increased from 50 to 91 points and for postnatal wards from 46 to 90 points. The CCA process and tools facilitated a systematic way for HCFs to identify, prioritize, make, and measure WASH quality of care improvements. Training facility staff was fundamental to improving quality standards, and involving medical and administration staff in joint analysis, coordination, and planning sessions was key to integration and teamwork. Further work is needed to increase involvement of local government and community members and to further adapt the process and tools. ","227":"","228":"","229":"Some opportunities to routinely capture and improve respectful maternity care (RMC) during facility-based childbirth include quality improvement (QI) initiatives, community-based monitoring efforts through community score cards (CSC), and performance-based financing (PBF) initiatives. But there is limited guidance on which types of RMC indicators are best suited for inclusion in these initiatives. We sought to provide practical evidence-based recommendations on indicators that may be used for routine measurement of RMC in programs. We used a rapid review approach, which included (1) reviewing existing documents and publications to extract RMC indicators and identify which have or can be used in facility-based QI, CSCs, and PBF schemes; (2) surveying RMC and maternal health experts to rank indicators, and (3) analyzing survey data to select the most recommended indicators. We identified 49 indicators spanning several domains of RMC and mistreatment including dignified\/nondignified care, verbal and physical abuse, privacy\/confidentiality, autonomy\/loss of autonomy, supportive care\/lack thereof, communication, stigma, discrimination, trust, facility environment\/culture, responsiveness, and nonevidence-based care. Based on the analysis of the survey data, we recommend 33 indicators (between 2 and 6 indicators for each RMC domain) that may be suited for incorporation in both facility-based QI and CSC-related monitoring efforts. Integrating RMC indicators into QI and CSC initiatives, as well as in other maternal and neonatal health programs, could help improve RMC at the facility and community level. More research is needed into whether RMC can be integrated into PBF initiatives. Integration of RMC indicators into programs to improve quality of care and other health system outcomes will facilitate routine monitoring and accountability around experience of care. Measurement and improvement of women's experiences will increase maternal health service utilization and improve quality of care as a means of reducing maternal and neonatal morbidity and mortality. ","230":"A home-based record (HBR) is a health document kept by the patient or their caregivers, rather than by the health care facility. HBRs are used in 163 countries, but they have not been implemented universally or consistently. Effective implementation maximizes both health impacts and cost-effectiveness. We sought to examine this research-to-practice gap and delineate the facilitators and barriers to the effective implementation and use of maternal and child health HBRs especially in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Using a framework analysis approach, we created a framework of implementation categories in advance using subject expert inputs. We collected information through 2 streams. First, we screened 69 gray literature documents, of which 18 were included for analysis. Second, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 12 key informants, each of whom had extensive experience with HBR implementation. We abstracted the relevant data from the documents and interviews into an analytic matrix. The matrix was based on the initial framework and adjusted according to emergent categories from the data. We identified 8 contributors to successful HBR implementation. These include establishing high-level support from the government and ensuring clear communication between all ministries and nongovernmental organizations involved. Choice of appropriate contents within the record was noted as important for alignment with the health system and for end user acceptance, as were the design, its physical durability, and timely redesigns. Logistical considerations, such as covering costs sustainably and arranging printing and distribution, could be potential bottlenecks. Finally, end users' engagement with HBRs depended on how the record was initially introduced to them and how its importance was reinforced over time by those in leadership positions. This framework analysis is the first study to take a more comprehensive and broad approach to the HBR implementation process in LMICs. The findings provide guidance for policy makers, donors, and health care practitioners regarding best implementation practice and effective HBR use, as well as where further research is required. ","231":null,"232":"A significant number of girls are married as children, which negatively impacts their health, education, and development. Given the sheer numbers of girls at risk of child marriage globally, the challenge to eliminate the practice is daunting. Programs to prevent child marriage are typically small-scale and overlook the costs and scalability of the intervention. This study tested and costed different approaches to preventing child marriage in rural Burkina Faso and Tanzania. The approaches tested were community dialogue, provision of school supplies, provision of a livestock asset, a model including all components, and a control arm. A quasi-experimental design was employed with surveys undertaken at baseline and after 2 years of intervention. We examined the prevalence of child marriage and school attendance controlling for background characteristics and stratified by age group. Programmatic costs were collected prospectively. Among those in the community dialogue arm in Burkina Faso, girls aged 15 to 17 years had two-thirds less risk (risk ratio [RR]=0.33; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.19, 0.60) of being married and girls aged 12 to 14 years had a greater chance of being in school (RR=1.18; 95% CI=1.07,1.29) compared to the control site. In Tanzania, girls aged 12 to 14 years residing in the multicomponent arm had two-thirds less risk of being married (RR=0.33; 95% CI=0.11, 0.99), and girls 15 to 17 in the conditional asset location had half the risk (RR=0.52; 95% CI=0.30, 0.91). All the interventions tested in Tanzania were associated with increased risk of girls 12 to 14 years old being in school, and the educational promotion arm was also associated with a 30% increased risk of girls aged 15 to 17 years attending school (RR=1.3; 95% CI=1.01, 1.67). Costs per beneficiary ranged from US$9 to US$117. The study demonstrates that minimal, low-cost approaches can be effective in delaying child marriage and increasing school attendance. However, community dialogues need to be designed to ensure sufficient quality and intensity of messaging. Program managers should pay attention to the cost, quality, and coverage of interventions, especially considering that child marriage persists in the most hard-to-reach rural areas of many countries. ","233":"","234":"","235":"We evaluated a 2-way short message service (SMS) communication platform to improve continuation of pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV prevention among Kenyan women who initiated PrEP within routine maternal child health (MCH) and family planning clinics. We adapted an existing SMS platform (Mobile WACh [mWACh]) to send PrEP-tailored, theory-based SMS and allow clients to communicate with a remote nurse. Women who did not have HIV and who were initiating PrEP at 2 MCH\/family planning clinics in Kisumu County, Kenya, from February to October 2018, were offered enrollment into the mWACh-PrEP program; SMS communication was free. We evaluated acceptability, satisfaction, and implementation metrics. In a pre\/postevaluation, we compared PrEP continuation at 1-month postinitiation among women who initiated PrEP in the period before (n=166) versus after mWACh-PrEP implementation, adjusting for baseline differences. Of the 334 women who were screened for enrollment into the mWACh-PrEP program; 193 (58%) were eligible and of those, 190 (98%) accepted enrollment. Reasons for ineligibility (n=141) included no phone access (29%) and shared SIM cards (25%). Median age was 25 years (interquartile range=22-30), and 91% were MCH clients. Compared to women who initiated PrEP in the month before mWACh-PrEP implementation, women who enrolled in mWACh-PrEP were more likely to return for their first PrEP follow-up visit (40% vs. 53%; adjusted risk ratio [aRR]=1.26; 95% confidence interval [CI]= 1.06, 1.50; P=.008) and more likely to continue PrEP (22% vs. 43%; aRR=1.75; 95% CI=1.21, 2.55; P=.003). Among those who returned, 99% reported successful receipt of SMS through the mWACh-PrEP system and 94% reported that mWACh-PrEP helped them understand PrEP better. Concerns about PrEP use, how it works, and side effects accounted for the majority (80%) of issues raised by participants using SMS. Two-way SMS expanded support for PrEP and opportunities for dialogue beyond the clinic and enabled women to ask and receive answers in real time regarding PrEP, which facilitated its continued use. ","236":"Coaching can improve the quality of care in primary-level birth facilities and promote birth attendant adherence to essential birth practices (EBPs) that reduce maternal and perinatal mortality. The intensity of coaching needed to promote and sustain behavior change is unknown. We investigated the relationship between coaching intensity, EBP adherence, and maternal and perinatal health outcomes using data from the BetterBirth Trial, which assessed the impact of a complex, coaching-based implementation of the World Health Organization's Safe Childbirth Checklist in Uttar Pradesh, India. For each birth, we defined multiple coaching intensity metrics, including coaching frequency (coaching visits per month), cumulative coaching (total coaching visits accrued during the intervention), and scheduling adherence (coaching delivered as scheduled). We considered coaching delivered at both facility and birth attendant levels. We assessed the association between coaching intensity and birth attendant adherence to 18 EBPs and with maternal and perinatal health outcomes using regression models. Coaching frequency was associated with modestly increased EBP adherence. Delivering 6 coaching visits per month to facilities was associated with adherence to 1.3 additional EBPs (95% confidence interval [CI]=0.6, 1.9). High-frequency coaching delivered with high coverage among birth attendants was associated with greater improvements: providing 70% of birth attendants at a facility with at least 1 visit per month was associated with adherence to 2.0 additional EBPs (95% CI=1.0, 2.9). Neither cumulative coaching nor scheduling adherence was associated with EBP adherence. Coaching was generally not associated with health outcomes, possibly due to the small magnitude of association between coaching and EBP adherence. Frequent coaching may promote behavior change, especially if delivered with high coverage among birth attendants. However, the effects of coaching were modest and did not persist over time, suggesting that future coaching-based interventions should explore providing frequent coaching for longer periods. ","237":"The focused assessment with sonography for HIV-associated tuberculosis (TB) (FASH) ultrasound protocol has been increasingly used to help clinicians diagnose TB. We sought to quantify the diagnostic utility of FASH for TB among individuals with HIV in Malawi. Between March 2016 and August 2017, 210 adults with HIV who had 2 or more signs and symptoms that were concerning for TB (fever, cough, night sweats, weight loss) were enrolled from a public HIV clinic in Lilongwe, Malawi. The treating clinicians conducted a history, physical exam, FASH protocol, and additional TB evaluation (laboratory diagnostics and chest radiography) on all participants. The clinician made a final treatment decision based on all available information. At the 6-month follow-up visit, we categorized participants based on clinical outcomes and diagnostic tests as having probable\/confirmed TB or unlikely TB; association of FASH with probable\/confirmed TB was calculated using Fisher's exact tests. The impact of FASH on empiric TB treatment was determined by asking the clinicians prospectively about whether they would start treatment at 2 time points in the baseline visit: (1) after the initial history and physical exam; and (2) after history, physical exam, and FASH protocol. A total of 181 participants underwent final analysis, of whom 56 were categorized as probable\/confirmed TB and 125 were categorized as unlikely TB. The FASH protocol was positive in 71% (40\/56) of participants with probable\/confirmed TB compared to 24% (30\/125) of participants with unlikely TB (odds ratio=7.9, 95% confidence interval=3.9,16.1; P&lt;.001). Among those classified as confirmed\/probable TB, FASH increased the likelihood of empiric TB treatment before obtaining any other diagnostic studies from 9% (5\/56) to 46% (26\/56) at the point-of-care. For those classified as unlikely TB, FASH increased the likelihood of empiric treatment from 2% to 4%. In the setting of HIV coinfection in Malawi, FASH can be a helpful tool that augments the clinician's ability to make a timely diagnosis of TB. ","238":"The Standard Days Method (SDM), a modern fertility awareness-based family planning method, has been introduced in 30 countries since its development in 2001. It is still unclear to what extent the SDM was mainstreamed within the family planning method mix, particularly in low- and middle-income country (LMIC) settings, where the SDM had been introduced by donors and implementing partners. This review of implementation science publications on the SDM in LMICs first looked at community pilot studies of the SDM to determine the acceptability of the method; correct use and efficacy rates; demographics of users; and changes to contraceptive prevalence rates and family planning behaviors, especially among men and couples. Then, we examined the status of the SDM in the 16 countries that had attempted to scale up the method within national family planning protocols, training, and service delivery. At the community level, evidence demonstrated a high level of acceptability of the method; efficacy rates comparable to the initial clinical trials; diversity in demographic characteristics of users, including first-time or recently discontinued users of family planning; increased male engagement in family planning; and improved couple's communication. Nationally, few countries had scaled up the SDM due to uneven stakeholder engagement, lackluster political will, and competing resource priorities. Results of this review could help policy makers determine the added value of the SDM in the contraceptive method mix and identify potential barriers to its implementation moving forward.","239":"Multimonth dispensing (MMD) of antiretroviral therapy (ART) is a differentiated model of care that can help overcome health system challenges and reduce the burden of HIV care on clients. Although 3-month dispensing has been the standard of care, interest has increased in extending refill intervals to 6 months. We explored client and provider experiences with MMD in Malawi as part of a cluster randomized trial evaluating 3- versus 6-month ART dispensing. Semi-structured in-depth interviews were conducted with 17 ART providers and 62 stable, adult clients with HIV on ART. Clients and providers were evenly divided by arm and were eligible for an interview if they had been participating in the study for 1 year (clients) or 6 months (providers). Questions focused on perceived challenges and benefits of the 3- or 6-month amount of ART dispensing. Interviews were transcribed, and data were coded and analyzed using constant comparison. Both clients and providers reported that the larger medication supply had benefits. Clients reported decreased costs due to less frequent travel to the clinic and increased time for income-generating activities. Clients in the 6-month dispensing arm reported a greater sense of personal freedom and normalcy. Providers felt that the 6-month dispensing interval reduced their workload. They also expressed concerned about clients' challenges with ART storage at home, but clients reported no storage problems. Although providers mentioned the potential risk of clients sharing the larger medication supply with family or friends, clients emphasized the value of ART and reported only rare, short-term sharing, mostly with their spouses. Providers mentioned clients' lack of motivation to seek care for illnesses that might occur between refill appointments. The 6-month ART dispensing arm was particularly beneficial to clients for decreased costs, increased time for income generation, and a greater sense of normalcy. Providers' concerns about storage, sharing, and return visits to the facility did not emerge in client interviews. Further data are needed on the feasibility of implementing a large-scale program with 6-month dispensing. ","240":"Historically, the family planning practices and needs of married women have been monitored and reported uniformly. However, the same uniformity does not hold for unmarried women. Because key data and information platforms employ different measurement approaches-namely, different definitions of sexual recency-reports of contraceptive prevalence and unmet need among unmarried women are inconsistent. We examine how the measurement approaches employed by 3 large organizations yield such divergent estimates. We find that contraceptive prevalence and unmet need estimates among married women do not vary much by sexual recency. For unmarried women, contraceptive prevalence is systematically lower and unmet need is systematically higher as the sexual recency window widens. In the short term, we recommend using the 1-month cutoff as analyses reveal it yields the most precise estimates for better recognizing the needs of this important demographic group.","241":"Timely identification and management of intrapartum complications could significantly reduce maternal deaths, intrapartum stillbirths, and newborn deaths due to hypoxia. The World Health Organization (WHO) identifies monitoring of labor using the paper partograph as a high-priority intervention for identifying abnormities in labor and fetal well-being. This article describes a mixed-method, quasi-experimental study to assess the effectiveness of an Android tablet-based electronic, labor clinical decision-support application (ePartogram) in limited-resource settings. The study, conducted in Kenya from October 2016 to May 2017, allocated 12 hospitals and health centers to an intervention (ePartogram) or comparison (paper partograph) group. Skilled birth attendants (SBAs) in both groups received a 2-day refresher training in labor management and partograph use. The intervention group received an additional 1-day orientation on use and care of the Android-based ePartogram app. All outcomes except one compare post-ePartogram intervention versus paper partograph controls. The exception is outcome of early perinatal mortality pre- and post-ePartogram introduction in intervention sites compared to control sites. We used log binomial regression to analyze the primary outcome of the study, suboptimal fetal outcomes. We also analyzed for secondary outcomes (SBAs performing recommended actions), and conducted in-depth interviews with facility in-charges and SBAs to ascertain acceptability and adoptability of the ePartogram. We compared data from 842 clients in active labor using ePartograms with data from 1,042 clients monitored using a paper partograph. SBAs using ePartograms were more likely than those using paper partographs to take action to maintain normal labor, such as ambulation, feeding, and fluid intake, and to address abnormal measurements of fetal well-being (14.7% versus 5.3%, adjusted relative risk=4.00, 95% confidence interval [CI]=1.95-8.19). Use of the ePartogram was associated with a 56% (95% CI=27%-73%) lower likelihood of suboptimal fetal outcomes than the paper partograph. Users of the ePartogram were more likely to be compliant with routine labor observations. SBAs stated that the technology was easy to use but raised concerns about its use at high-volume sites. Further research is needed to evaluate costs and benefit and to incorporate recent WHO guidance on labor management. ePartogram use was associated with improvements in adherence to recommendations for routine labor care and a reduction in adverse fetal outcomes, with providers reporting adoptability without undue effort. Continued development of the ePartogram, including incorporating new clinical rules from the 2018 WHO recommendations on intrapartum care, will improve labor monitoring and quality care at all health system levels.

The peers, known as community adolescent treatment supporters (CATS), are people living with HIV (PLHIV) aged 18-24 years who are trained and mentored to support their peers throughout the HIV care continuum through support groups, home visits, phone call reminders, and messages. We report the HIV care continuum outcomes (HIV testing uptake, antiretroviral therapy [ART] uptake, retention, and viral suppression) in a cohort of household contacts and sexual partners (aged younger than 25 years) of index children, adolescents, and young adults living with HIV identified by CATS from October 2017 to September 2018 in 24 districts of Zimbabwe. This was a retrospective cohort study involving analysis of routine program data, extracted from electronic databases consisting of data on contacts of index PLHIV and ART outcomes. We used April 30, 2019, as the censor date for all analyses. A total of 15,223 household contacts and sexual partners with unknown HIV status (linked to 9,353 index PLHIV) were identified and referred for HIV testing. Of these, 12,114 (79.6%) were tested and 1,193 (9.8%) were HIV-positive. Of the latter, 1,153 (96.6%) were initiated on ART with 99% starting on the day of diagnosis. Of those on ART, 1,151 (99.8%) were alive on ART at 6 months and 2 (0.2%) died. A total of 1,044 (91%) children, adolescents, and young people living with HIV underwent viral load testing at 6 months or later, of whom 1,037 (99.3%) were virally suppressed (&lt;1000 copies\/ml). These findings add to the global evidence demonstrating the effectiveness of peer-led interventions in children, adolescents, and young adults living with HIV and justify the decision of the MOHCC in Zimbabwe to scale-up the model nationally. Future research should aim to understand the reasons for the gaps in HIV testing and viral load testing using qualitative research.

Remote temperature monitoring (RTM) technology for vaccine refrigerators has shown promise for improving the ability of supply systems to maintain optimal temperature conditions to ensure potent vaccines reach the end users. A pilot study of RTM technology and data use teams was implemented in 36 study sites in Kenya. Data were collected at baseline and endline points over a 3-month baseline and 7-month implementation period. Data included 44 qualitative interviews, process logs, meeting minutes from data use team meetings, and quantitative temperature and power data from the RTM devices. The ability of cold chain equipment to maintain World Health Organization-recommended temperatures in study sites improved markedly between the baseline and implementation periods, resulting in an improvement in total time spent in the correct range from 83.9% in the baseline period to 90.9% in the intervention period and an improvement in time spent in the too cold range from 6.5% to 1.5%. Friedman tests revealed that differences in time spent in the correct range and time spent in the too cold range during the course of the study were statistically significant (P&lt;.001 and P=.04, respectively). Qualitative and quantitative data suggest that this improvement was due to a combination of improved responsiveness to temperature excursions at the facility level, resulting from SMS alarms for temperature excursion periods, and improved ability at the management level to recognize and address recurring problems. The combination of using RTM technology with a structured data review process by a management team is a promising approach for improving cold chain outcomes. Future research examining the added value of each of the technological and behavioral components separately is needed. ","246":"The potential gains from full adoption of World Health Organization (WHO)-recommended rapid diagnostics (WRDs) for tuberculosis (TB) are significant, but there is no current analysis of the additional investment needed to reach this goal. We sought to estimate the necessary investment in instruments, tests, and money, using Xpert MTB\/RIF (Xpert), which detects Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) and tests for resistance to rifampicin (RIF), as an example. An existing calculator for TB diagnostic needs was adapted to estimate the Xpert needs for a group of 24 countries with high TB burdens. This analysis assumed that countries will achieve the case-finding commitments agreed to at the recent United Nations High-Level Meeting on the Fight to End Tuberculosis, and that countries would adopt the WHO-recommended algorithm in which all people with signs and symptoms of TB receive an Xpert test. When compared to the current investments in these countries, this baseline model revealed that countries would require a 4-fold increase in the number of Xpert modules and a 6-fold increase in the number of Xpert test cartridges per year to meet their full testing needs. The incremental cost of the additional instruments for these countries would total approximately US$474 million, plus an incremental cost each year of cartridges of approximately $586 million, or a 5-fold increase over current investments. A sensitivity analysis revealed a variety of possible changes under alternative scenarios, but most of these changes either do not meet the global goals, are unrealistic, or would result in even greater investment needs. These findings suggest that a major investment is needed in WRD capacity to implement the recommended diagnostic algorithm for TB and reach the case-finding commitments by 2022.","247":"We applied a novel approach to visualizing contraceptive histories from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) contraceptive calendar to elucidate patterns of contraceptive switching and discontinuation (e.g., \"churn\" in contraceptive use across 2 points in time). Taking the contraceptive calendar from the 2014 Kenya DHS, we used R, an open source statistical programming platform, and the chorddiag package to create interactive chord diagrams to visualize contraceptive use trajectories, including switching and discontinuation, for all contraceptive types queried in the DHS. We present screenshots from the interactive version. We also tested the usefulness of our chord diagram with potential users, including family planning researchers and advocates. Chord diagrams are visually appealing and provide users with the ability to investigate unique patterns in contraceptive discontinuation using publicly available data from the DHS. After receiving a brief orientation to a chord diagram, users found the chord diagram easy to understand and manipulate. The chord diagram is a potentially powerful way for family planning researchers, advocates, and program managers to visualize women's contraceptive trajectories and provides insights into the churn in contraceptive use between 2 discrete time periods.","248":"","249":"Malawi's guidelines for Clinical Management of HIV in Children and Adults promote the practice of provider-initiated family planning (PIFP) for all clients over the age of 15. The guidelines recommend that providers should offer all clients condoms, offer injectables to female clients, and refer clients to another provider or site if clients prefer another family planning method. This study assessed to what extent family planning services had been integrated into HIV services among 41 facilities in Malawi (hospitals, health posts, health centers; public and nonprofit private) and how the reproductive rights of people living with HIV were being addressed. Data were collected through facility audits (N=41), provider interviews (N=122), client exit interviews (N=425), and mystery client visits (N=58). This study found that contrary to clinical protocols, only 14% of clients at the antiretroviral therapy (ART) clinic had reported being asked about their family planning\/fertility intentions during the visit that day. Only 24% of providers at the facility had received training on family planning-HIV integration, and 21% had no family planning training at all. Overwhelmingly, ART clients relied on condoms to meet their family planning needs. Only 24% of ART clinics had injectables available, and only 15% of ART clinics had a full range of family planning methods (short- and long-acting, hormonal and non-hormonal) available to clients. These findings suggest that Malawi's strong national policies on family planning-HIV integration, and specifically PIFP, are not being implemented in practice and thus not adequately addressing the family planning needs of clients with HIV. To improve PIFP, Malawi requires targeted systems changes. Facilities need to broaden their family planning method mix offerings. Furthermore, providers need more training on family planning and the importance of HIV clients having access to family planning services, and referral services need to be strengthened so providers can ensure clients have access to their method of choice in a timely manner.","250":"","251":"","252":"","253":"For many women, convenient access to family planning in their communities provides the impetus they need to start and maintain use of a family planning method. The benefits of family planning task shifting, which allows community health workers (CHWs) to provide methods such as oral contraceptive pills and injectables within communities, were publicly recognized by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2009. WHO's 2012 global guidelines on task sharing recommended CHW provision of injectable contraception, accompanied by targeted monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E); however, the term \"targeted\" was not defined. To fill this gap, we undertook a literature review, technical consultation, and case studies in Malawi, Senegal, and Uganda to inform our development of a list of M&amp;E indicators, supporting guidance, and job aids to help strengthen community-based access to injectable contraception programs and their ability to follow WHO recommendations. We identified 4 essential indicators: there are enough CHWs certified to provide injectables to meet project goals, CHWs are being appropriately supervised to ensure client safety, the stock of injectables is reliable and can meet project goals, and clients are receiving injections.","254":"Health facilities managed by faith-based organizations (FBOs) are important providers of health care in Kenya but provide only a small proportion of family planning services in the country. From 2013 to 2017, the Christian Health Association of Kenya (CHAK) implemented a project with 6 FBO-managed health facilities to increase voluntary family planning services in western Kenya, in partnership with religious leaders and community health volunteers (CHVs). The project aimed to build capacity of FBO-managed health facilities, increase religious leaders' knowledge of family planning, mobilize communities, improve family planning access and referrals for services, and advocate for improved family planning commodity security from the public sector. Project impact was evaluated using facility-level service statistics, project records and reports, and feedback from religious leaders and CHVs who implemented the project. Facility service statistics showed large increases in family planning visits. Phase 1 (2013-2014) was implemented at 2 health facilities, where client visits for family planning increased sixfold (from 705 to 4,286 visits) with tenfold increases seen in client visits for pills, intrauterine devices, and implants. In Phase 2 (2015-2017), the project was expanded to an additional 4 health facilities and total client visits for family planning nearly doubled (from 7,925 to 14,832 visits). During Phase 2, new client visits for implants increased threefold, making implants the most popular family planning method. Religious leaders who implemented the project reported reaching nearly 700,000 people with family planning messages and referring more than 87,000 clients to health facilities for family planning services. The religious leaders expressed confidence in the effectiveness of the project and in their role in enhancing access to voluntary family planning. Health facilities, religious leaders, and CHVs also reported multiple challenges to implementation, including inconsistent supply of family planning commodities from county health departments. This project demonstrates the potential of FBO-managed facilities and faith leaders to increase family planning demand and service provision, as well as the importance of coordination with the public sector to ensure supply of commodities and support for FBO-managed facilities.","255":"Recent studies of Indian men who have sex with men (MSM) have shown widespread use of social media for seeking sex partners. We piloted a peer mobilization approach to explore the feasibility of engaging previously unreached MSM online to link them to HIV testing services (HTS). MSM were encouraged to seek HTS through messages posted on a popular dating website. Those who visited the designated HTS site and tested for HIV were recruited as peer mobilizers and given coupons with unique identifying codes to distribute to other men in their virtual networks. If a network member presented at the site with a coupon and tested for HIV, the peer mobilizer was given a small monetary incentive. Network members presenting at the testing site were also recruited as peer mobilizers and given coupons. In a 6-month period, 247 MSM were recruited and tested for HIV and syphilis, of whom 244 (99%) were first-time testers. Two-thirds were less than 25 years old and about half reported inconsistent or no condom use during the last 10 anal sex acts. Eight individuals (3.2%) tested positive for HIV, and 22 (8.9%) had a high titer for syphilis; all were referred to tertiary hospitals for treatment. Our approach was modestly successful in reaching and providing HTS to previously unreached MSM, but challenges included lower-than-expected recruitment, individuals not returning for posttest counseling, and loss to follow-up of individuals with HIV. The next phase of peer mobilization will aim to scale up these services through government-supported targeted interventions for this subpopulation of primarily young, unreached MSM at high risk. The challenges will be addressed by targeting more dating sites, increasing access to testing using rapid HIV tests at several community-based facilities, and offering peer navigation support for people living with HIV.","256":"The governments of Tanzania and Zambia identified key data-related challenges affecting immunization service delivery including identifying children due for vaccines, time-consuming data entry processes, and inadequate resources. To address these challenges, since 2014, the countries have partnered with PATH's Better Immunization Data Initiative to design and deploy a suite of data quality and use interventions. Two key aspects of the interventions were an electronic immunization registry and tools and practices to strengthen a culture of data use. As both countries deployed the interventions, 3 distinct changes in data use emerged organically. This article provides a detailed summary of these 3 phases or waves, based mostly on qualitative data or observation: (1) strengthening data collection using new data collection tools and processes and increasing efficiency of health workers; (2) improving data quality regarding accuracy and completeness; and (3) increasing use of data to take action to strengthen their work and for programmatic decision making. These waves clearly demonstrated the growing ability of health workers to move from data collectors to data analyzers who began to focus on the data quality and then the value of using the data in their day-to-day activities.","257":"Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) ages 15-24 years are disproportionately affected by HIV\/AIDS, particularly in East and Southern Africa. One strategy to reduce HIV among AGYW, proposed through the Determined, Resilient, Empowered, AIDS-free, Mentored, and Safe (DREAMS) Initiative, is to prevent and manage HIV among their male sexual partners. To implement this strategy and reach men, programs need information about AGYW's potential sexual partners at the local level. To support DREAMS programming in Mozambique, we undertook a study to characterize this population of men in 3 districts with ongoing DREAMS programming. In mid-2017 we conducted 15 focus group discussions with AGYW (N=102) and a venue-based intercept survey of men (N=1,140). Male sexual partners of AGYW who took the survey were diverse in age, education level, and socioeconomic status. Older AGYW focus group participants sought partners who could provide for them financially. Multiple sexual partnerships and inconsistent condom use were widely reported, with AGYW emphasizing that gender norms disempowered them from negotiating condom use. Reported condom use varied by AGYW and male-partner demographic characteristics, as well as by their relationship type. Condom use rates were much higher than national and regional estimates. AGYW who were less educated\/not-in-school, were pregnant, or single mothers were particularly disempowered in sexual relationships. Less educated men were less likely to use condoms than educated men, and condom use was least likely in marriage. Study findings underscore the importance of reaching the diversity of male sexual partners of AGYW with HIV services as part of a strategy to reduce HIV risk among AGYW. They also support an enhanced focus on female-controlled HIV prevention methods that do not require negotiation with a male partner and special efforts to reach out-of-school\/less educated AGYW, as well as pregnant AGYW and single mothers.","258":"Integration of family planning and immunization services provides an opportunity to meet women's need for postpartum family planning and infants' vaccination needs through client-centered care, while reducing financial and opportunity costs for families. The United States Agency for International Development's Maternal and Child Survival Program (MCSP) supported the Liberia Ministry of Health to scale up integrated family planning and immunization services as part of a broader service delivery and health systems recovery program after the Ebola epidemic. We conducted a mixed-methods program evaluation in 22 health facilities in Grand Bassa and Lofa counties. Family planning uptake and immunization dropout rates at project sites were compared to rates at 18 matched health facilities in the same counties. We conducted 34 focus group discussions with community members and 43 key informant interviews with health care providers and managers to explore quality of care and contextual factors affecting provision and use of integrated services including postpartum family planning. From November 2016 to July 2017, 1,066 women accepted referrals from immunization to family planning counseling (10% of all vaccinator-caregiver interactions); the majority of women who were referred (75%) accepted a family planning method the same day. Trends indicated slightly higher family planning uptake in intervention over nonintervention facilities, but differences were not statistically significant. Pentavalent vaccine dropout rates did not increase in intervention compared to nonintervention facilities indicating no negative impact on utilization of immunization services. Clients and providers expressed that the integrated services reduced costs and time for the clients, educated mothers about postpartum family planning, and ensured infants were completing their vaccinations. Providers expressed the need for increased human resources to meet the elevated demand for family planning counseling services and additional focus on community-level social and behavior change activities. Both groups emphasized that social stigma and norms about postpartum sexual abstinence prevented many women from seeking postpartum family planning services. Although scaling up integrated family planning-immunization services may be programmatically feasible and acceptable to clients and providers, the intervention's success and ability to understand and quantify impact are driven by the effect of contextual factors and fidelity to the intervention approach. Contextual factors need to be understood before implementation, measured during implementation, and addressed throughout implementation to maximize the approach's impact on service utilization and health outcomes. ","259":"Since the 2015 Zika outbreak in Latin America and the Caribbean, a plethora of behavior change messages have been promoted to reduce Zika transmission. One year after the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) initiated its Zika response, more than 30 variants of preventive behaviors were being promoted. This situation challenged social and behavior change (SBC) programming efforts that require a coordinated response and agreed upon set of focus behaviors to be effective. To support USAID implementing partners in harmonizing prevention efforts to reduce Zika infection, we developed an evidence-based process to identify behaviors with the highest potential to reduce Zika infection and transmission. We compiled a full list of behaviors and selected the most promising for a full evidence review. The review included systematic keyword searches on Google Scholar, extraction of all relevant published articles on Aedes-borne diseases between 2012 and 2018, review of seminal papers, and review of gray literature. We examined articles to determine each behavior's potential effectiveness in preventing Zika transmission or reducing the Aedes aegypti population. We also developed assessment criteria to delineate the ease with which the target population could adopt each behavior, including: (1) required frequency; (2) feasibility of the behavior; and (3) accessibility and cost of the necessary materials in the setting. These behaviors were refined through a consensus-building process with USAID's Zika implementing partners, considering contextual factors. The resulting 7 evidence-based preventive behaviors have high potential to strengthen SBC programming's impact in USAID's Zika response: (1) apply mosquito repellent, (2) use condoms during pregnancy, (3) remove standing water, (4) cover water storage containers, (5) clean\/remove mosquito eggs from water containers, (6) seek antenatal care, and (7) seek family planning counseling. This case study documents a flexible process that can be adapted to inform the prioritization of behaviors when there is limited evidence available, as during many emergency responses.","260":"Mobile phones for health (mHealth) hold promise for delivering behavioral interventions. We evaluated the effect of automated interactive voice messages promoting contraceptive use with a focus on long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) among women in Bangladesh who had undergone menstrual regulation (MR), a procedure to \"regulate the menstrual cycle when menstruation is absent for a short duration.\" We recruited MR clients from 41 public- and private-sector clinics immediately after MR. Eligibility criteria included having a personal mobile phone and consenting to receive messages about family planning by phone. We randomized participants remotely to an intervention group that received at least 11 voice messages about contraception over 4 months or to a control group (no messages). The primary outcome was LARC use at 4 months. Adverse events measured included experience of intimate partner violence (IPV). Researchers recruiting participants and 1 analyst were blinded to allocation groups. All analyses were intention to treat. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov (NCT02579785). Between December 2015 and March 2016, 485 women were allocated to the intervention group and 484 to the control group. We completed follow-up on 389 intervention and 383 control participants. Forty-eight (12%) participants in the intervention group and 59 (15%) in the control group reported using a LARC method at 4 months (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] using multiple imputation=0.95; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.49 to 1.83; P=.22). Reported physical IPV was higher in the intervention group: 42 (11%) intervention versus 25 (7%) control (aOR=1.97; 95% CI=1.12 to 3.46; P=.03) when measured using a closed question naming acts of violence. No violence was reported in response to an open question about effects of being in the study. The intervention did not increase LARC use but had an unintended consequence of increasing self-reported IPV. Researchers and health program designers should consider possible negative impacts when designing and evaluating mHealth and other reproductive health interventions. IPV must be measured using closed questions naming acts of violence. ","261":"","262":"","263":"","264":"Eclampsia-related conditions are the second leading direct cause of obstetric deaths in Bangladesh. Efforts to prevent such deaths in low- and middle-income countries are increasingly focused on task shifting at the primary care level to enable frontline providers to screen and initiate treatment for women with preeclampsia, severe preeclampsia, and eclampsia (PE\/SPE\/E). The MaMoni Health Systems Strengthening project (funded by the United States Agency for International Development) implemented a magnesium sulfate intervention at primary care facilities in 4 Bangladesh districts in 2016 and 2017. The project trained frontline providers through a cascade approach from the national to the union level. A PE\/SPE\/E patient algorithm, digital blood pressure machines, and eclampsia kits with magnesium sulfate were supplied to service providers at each facility. We conducted a retrospective record review of facility-level data to assess the degree to which newly trained frontline providers adhered to a protocol that incorporated the use of magnesium sulfate for SPE\/E in primary care settings. In total, 283 women were found to have PE\/SPE\/E. Fifty-four percent were managed according to the protocol. The required supplies were present at each facility, but some issues existed with regard to availability and functionality of blood pressure apparatuses. Challenges related to recordkeeping and service quality limited the analysis. Frontline providers need refresher trainings, ongoing supervision, properly calibrated blood pressure devices, and performance monitoring support in order to improve screening and management of PE\/SPE\/E in primary care facilities. ","265":"Family planning programs are guided by the principle of informed choice as well as the goal of providing a broad choice of contraceptive methods to clients. Provider bias is an important barrier to realizing this goal, but it must be clearly defined and understood to be effectively addressed. This review presents an overview of the concept of provider bias in family planning, focusing on the following issues: (1) what it is, (2) how widespread it is, (3) its underlying causes, (4) its impacts, and (5) how it can be effectively addressed. The definitions of provider bias include common themes about providers creating barriers to choice, typically based on the characteristics of either a client or a contraceptive method. However, an agreed-upon definition is lacking. Measurement of provider bias has often relied on self-reports by providers but has also included observation and use of mystery clients for supplemental data. The general trend in the data is clear: large numbers of providers impose barriers and restrictions beyond those that are in guidelines or are necessary for any medical reasons. This trend indicates the presence of bias. Providers have shown bias based on age, parity, marital status, and other criteria, with a bias against provision of various contraceptive methods to youth being the most common. Provider bias often stems from broader social norms, particularly judgments about sexual activity among youth and concerns about the impact of hormonal methods on future fertility. Little documentation of the impact of provider bias exists, although method mix skew has been identified as a possible red flag for bias. Newer approaches to address bias that have moved beyond traditional training and guidelines development to more fundamental behavior change efforts show promise, and learning from their lessons will be important. A major question is how to scale up such approaches.","266":"Family planning counseling and provision of a variety of contraceptive methods during postabortion care (PAC) can increase voluntary contraceptive use and prevent unintended pregnancies, helping to reduce maternal morbidity and mortality. Youth in Togo, however, face many barriers to accessing contraceptives during PAC including provider bias, parental consent policies, stigma, and pressure on young people to have children. This article describes the lessons learned from follow-up with providers who were trained on PAC to build their willingness and skills in offering youth-friendly PAC. With assistance from the Evidence to Action (E2A) Project, Togo's Division for Maternal and Infant Health and Family Planning (DSMI\/PF) systematically applied IntraHealth International's Optimizing Performance and Quality (OPQ) approach to improve the quality of PAC at 5 health facilities from 2014 to 2016. OPQ identified gaps and helped establish solutions to shortcomings that hinder youth's access to contraceptive choice during PAC. To address these shortcomings, staff trained providers to improve their knowledge, attitudes, and skills with regard to (1) medical eligibility criteria for contraceptive use to remove age as justification for denying contraceptives; (2) AFPAC to increase the ability to consider gender-based violence and to encourage client-focused and age-sensitive counseling; and (3) monitoring through disaggregation of data by age, method, and parity for data-driven planning and delivery of AFPAC. Providers reported improved attitudes and empathy toward young PAC clients, efforts to screen for exposure to sexual and gender-based violence, and willingness to explore reproductive health needs and assist clients in choosing contraceptive methods. Previously, no youth PAC clients chose contraceptives during PAC or returned to the facility for routine follow-up. After providers received OPQ training, they treated 775 PAC clients in 5 health facilities between June and December 2016; 351 were ages 14-24, of whom 142 (40.5%) chose a modern contraceptive. The most common method selected by youth was oral contraceptive pills (44%), followed by implants (41%) and injectables (15%). Of the 142 youth PAC clients who chose a method, 86 (58.5%) returned for the 7-day follow-up. Training providers to offer AFPAC along with the application of OPQ to improve the quality of PAC increases voluntary contraceptive uptake, including implants, among youth who make up a substantial portion of all PAC clients. Incorporating AFPAC in family planning\/reproductive health policies, norms, protocols, and PAC training, as Togo's DSMI\/PF did, is an important element to ensuring institutionalization of the practice. ","267":"Based on research conducted in 2017, we estimated the cost to the Tanzanian health care system of providing postabortion care (PAC). PAC is an integrated service package that addresses the curative and preventive needs of women experiencing complications from abortion. PAC services include treating complications of miscarriage and incomplete abortion, providing voluntary family planning counseling and services, and engaging the community to reduce future unintended pregnancies and repeat abortions. Thirty-one public and private health facilities, representing 3 levels of health care, were selected for data collection from key care providers and administrators in 3 regions. We gathered data on the direct costs of PAC startup (i.e., training and capital costs), as well as the recurrent costs of medicines, supplies, hospitalization, and personnel, and the indirect costs of PAC provision. We also gathered data to estimate PAC clients' out-of-pocket expenses. Estimates of the average cost per client (i.e., unit cost) were calculated for treatment of routine and severe abortion complications, treatment at different levels of health care, postabortion contraception, and various available treatment methods. We found that the unit cost of PAC training per provider was US$163.43. The total unit cost was $72.91. The unit recurrent cost of treating routine complications, which included 81% of the cases in our sample, was $36.23. The cost of treating incomplete abortion through manual vacuum aspiration was $22.63, while the cost of treatment with misoprostol was $18.74. The average cost of providing voluntary postabortion family planning was $11.56. We estimated an average client out-of-pocket expenditure on PAC of $22.96. We applied our unit cost estimates to those on PAC utilization and provision and unmet need for PAC that were derived from research conducted in Tanzania in 2013-2016, and we estimated an annual national cost of PAC of $4,170,476. We estimated the cost of providing PAC for all women who have abortion complications, including those who do not access PAC, at $10,426,299. Investing more resources in voluntary family planning and PAC treatment of routine complications at the primary level would likely reduce health system costs. ","268":"In 2015, the government of Tanzania launched an effort to strengthen the quality of postabortion care (PAC), an integrated health service that includes treatment for abortion complications and provision of family planning counseling and voluntary services, in 25 facilities in mainland Tanzania and in Zanzibar. To help guide the government's initiative, we conducted a mixed-method study in 2016 using health facility surveys and in-depth interviews with health care workers that offer PAC. Surveys of the 25 facilities assessed the current use of services and readiness to deliver them. Provider performance in PAC was assessed through direct observation of client-provider interactions. In-depth interviews (IDIs) with 30 staff from the facilities provided qualitative information on priorities for PAC quality improvement. In the 6 months preceding the study, 2,175 PAC clients sought care at the facilities. Of these PAC clients, 55% chose a family planning method, of whom 6% chose a voluntary long-acting reversible contraceptive. The median facility PAC readiness scores were 45% for health centers, 49% for district hospitals, and 61% for regional referral hospitals. Direct observations of manual vacuum aspiration provision for PAC revealed that providers implemented, on average, 69% of the critical clinical steps. For misoprostol provision, PAC providers implemented, on average, 42% of the critical steps. Multilevel influences affected PAC providers' work, often adversely, by shaping their confidence in their technical competency, confusing their role as health care workers and as clients' peers, and coloring their attitudes toward clientele. The PAC providers also felt that their ability to implement their responsibilities was shaped by lapses in essential support and functionality of the health care system, as well as by social and cultural norms. Technical assistance approaches that blend training, clinical quality improvement, systems strengthening, and social interventions that address demand-side barriers are needed to ensure providers achieve their potential and are able to deliver high-quality PAC. ","269":"In 2015, the government of Tanzania began to strengthen the quality of postabortion care (PAC). Limited research has been conducted to understand clients' perceptions of public sector provision of PAC. Accordingly, we carried out a mixed-method study between April and July 2016, using client surveys and in-depth interviews, both implemented immediately following PAC. Results were used to help guide the government's initiative. We assessed the quality of PAC in 25 public-sector facilities through a client survey of 412 women. Questions included satisfaction with client-staff interaction, counseling, provider competence, postabortion family planning, accessibility of care, and the facility environment. Based on responses, we developed and validated a scale representing women's overall satisfaction with the quality of care. We conducted bivariate analysis to identify the levels of care associated with clients' ranking of individual and composite measures of the quality of care. We used multivariate ordinal logistic models to assess the relative influence of multilevel factors on clients' overall satisfaction. We coupled our survey with qualitative analysis of in-depth interviews with 30 PAC clients. Clients reported moderately high levels of satisfaction with the quality of PAC, with an overall mean score of 2.6 on a 4-point scale. Bivariate analysis identified several areas for improvement, including family planning counseling and provision, especially at regional hospitals; pain management; and reduced use of sharp curettage. The factors most strongly associated with satisfaction were advanced parity, receiving care at lower-level facilities, brief waiting periods, and manual vacuum aspiration for treatment of incomplete abortion. Qualitative analysis illuminated how client-provider interactions; pain; desire for counseling and information, especially on family planning; and congested facility environments shape clients' perceptions of the care they received. Although clear areas for improvement in public-sector provision of PAC existed at all sites, women were less likely to report satisfaction with care at referral facilities owing primarily to inadequate counseling, delays in receiving PAC treatment after admission, and poor emphasis on postabortion fertility, family planning information, and contraceptive provision. PAC programs should ensure availability of a wide range of contraceptive methods and high-quality family planning counseling, especially at tertiary facilities. ","270":"Postabortion care (PAC) is a lifesaving intervention that, when accessible and of good quality, can prevent the majority of abortion-related deaths. However, these services are only sporadically available and often of poor quality in humanitarian settings. CARE International, the International Rescue Committee, and Save the Children strengthened the Congolese Ministry of Health to provide PAC, including voluntary contraceptive services, in North and South Kivu, DRC. We aimed to gain understanding of the demographic and clinical characteristics of PAC clients, the experiences of women who sought PAC at supported health facilities, and the women's perceptions of the quality of care received. We also explored how client perspectives can inform future PAC programming. A PAC register review extracted sociodemographic and clinical data on all PAC clients during a 12-month period between 2015 and 2016 at 69 supported facilities in 6 health zones. In-depth interviews were conducted between September 2016 and April 2017 with 50 women who sought PAC in the preceding 3 months at supported health facilities. Interviews were recorded, transcribed, and translated into French for analysis. Thematic content analysis was subsequently used as the data analytic approach. In 12 months, 1,769 clients sought PAC at supported facilities; 85.2% were at less than 13 weeks gestation. Over 80% of PAC clients were treated for incomplete abortion, and of these, 90% were treated with manual vacuum aspiration. The majority (75.2%) of PAC clients chose voluntary postabortion contraception. All but one interview participant reported seeking PAC for a spontaneous abortion, although most also reported their pregnancy was unintended. Clients were mostly made aware that PAC was available by community health workers or other community members. Experiences at the supported facilities were mostly positive, particularly in regards to client-provider interactions. Most women received contraceptive counseling during PAC and selected a modern method of contraception immediately after treatment. However, knowledge about different methods of contraception varied. Nearly all women said that they would advise another woman experiencing abortion complications to seek PAC at a supported health facility. The findings demonstrate the successful implementation of good-quality, respectful PAC in North and South Kivu. Overall, they suggest that the organizations' support of health workers, including competency-based training and supportive supervision, was successful. ","271":"Integrating voluntary family planning into postabortion care (PAC) presents a critical opportunity to reduce future unintended pregnancies. Although Guinea has low contraceptive prevalence overall, acceptance of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) among PAC clients is higher than among interval LARC users and higher than the national average. In 2014, we assessed the extent of LARC provision within PAC services and the factors influencing integration. Primary and secondary data collected from 143 interviews, 75 provider assessments, and facility inventories and service statistics from all 38 public facilities providing PAC in Guinea allowed exploration of voluntary family planning uptake in the context of PAC. Study findings showed that 38 of 456 (8.3%) public health facilities or 38 of 122 (31.1%) facilities with a mandate to manage obstetric complications provided PAC services. Service statistics from 4,544 PAC clients in 2013 indicate that 95.2% received counseling and 73.0% voluntarily left the facility with contraception, with 29.6% of acceptors choosing a LARC. Family planning within PAC was emphasized in advocacy, policy and guidelines, quality improvement, and supervision, and the range of contraceptive options for postabortion clients was expanded to enable them to avoid a second unintended pregnancy. Factors that influenced provision of family planning within PAC included (1) the ability of champions both within and outside the Ministry of Public Health to advocate for PAC and leverage donor resources, (2) the incorporation of PAC with postabortion family planning into national policies, standards, and guidelines, (3) training of large numbers of providers in PAC and LARCs, and (4) integration of LARCs within PAC into quality improvement and supervision tools and performance standards. Guinea has gradually scaled up provision of PAC services nationwide and its experience may offer learning opportunities for other countries; however, continued advocacy for further expansion to more rural areas of the country and among private health facilities is necessary.","272":"In Tanzania, limited access to postabortion care (PAC) contributes to high rates of maternal mortality. To address the issue, Pathfinder International and the Tanzania Ministry of Health, Community Development, Gender, Elderly and Children (MOHCDGEC) introduced and expanded coverage of PAC in 64 public health facilities in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. During a 30-month period, we implemented a multifaceted approach to introduce and expand PAC, including clinical training and mentorship for health care providers; service reorganization, equipment provision, and an expanded method mix offering; standardization of PAC reporting tools; and community engagement and referral. We assessed outcomes using PAC service statistics from 64 public health facilities in 4 districts of Dar es Salaam and health care provider mentorship data from 385 observed PAC visits. From January 2016 to June 2018, voluntary postabortion contraceptive uptake increased steadily. A total of 6,636 PAC clients, including 2,731 young people (ages 10-24), adopted a method post-procedure. Average semesterly client volume per facility increased from 27 to 52.4 manual vacuum aspiration clients and 17.6 to 43.9 postabortion contraceptors between the first and last periods. Overall postabortion contraceptive uptake was 80.6% (6,636\/8,230), with a method mix of 58.3% implant, 18.9% intrauterine device, 13.7% pills, 8.6% injectables, and 0.5% permanent methods. Adults and young people had comparable method mix. Mentored providers showed improvements in service quality indicators. During the last period, 92% counseled the client on contraception, 93% considered the client's sexual and reproductive health intentions, 94% provided correct method information and supply, and 96% documented services on the client's family planning card. Different provider types (mid- and senior-level) performed comparably. Expanding PAC coverage to primary- and secondary-level facilities led to high uptake of voluntary contraception among postabortion clients. Key interventions included PAC clinical training and mentorship; service reorganization, equipment provision, and an expanded method mix offering; use of standardized PAC registers; and community engagement for awareness building and linkage to PAC. ","273":"Unsafe abortion remains a problem in Rwanda, where abortion is highly restricted by law. To reduce mortality and morbidity from unsafe abortion, Rwanda implemented a national postabortion care (PAC) program in 2012, which included using misoprostol to treat incomplete abortion. Key components of PAC are offering and providing voluntary contraceptive methods and counseling on their use, but little is known about contraceptive uptake among PAC clients treated with misoprostol. The objectives of the current study were (1) to assess the contraceptive uptake of PAC clients treated with misoprostol, including whether extended bleeding hinders uptake; and (2) to assess providers' knowledge of contraception and their willingness to counsel PAC clients on contraception, provide methods, or refer for contraceptive services. We surveyed 68 PAC clients treated with misoprostol and 43 providers (84% nurses) in 17 health facilities across 3 districts in Rwanda where misoprostol for PAC had been introduced recently. PAC clients were recruited into the study prior to facility discharge and surveyed between 10 days and 1 month after discharge. We asked PAC clients and providers about demographic characteristics and attitudes toward contraception. We also asked PAC clients about contraceptive counseling received and postabortion contraceptive uptake or reasons for nonuse, and providers about their knowledge about return to fertility, pregnancy and contraceptive counseling, practices related to contraceptive method provision, and their knowledge and potential biases about PAC clients using contraception. We used descriptive statistics for analysis. PAC clients were 19-46 years old, and most (69%) had at least 1 child. Almost all PAC clients (94%) reported being counseled on contraception, but only 47% reported choosing and receiving a method before being discharged from the facility. Nevertheless, by the time of the survey, 71% reported using a method. PAC clients' main reason for not using contraception was wanting to become pregnant. Only 1 woman reported nonuse because of bleeding. Among providers, more than half (56%) reported there are contraceptive methods PAC clients should never use and about a quarter (26%) reported incorrect information on when PAC clients' fertility could return. We found no evidence that bleeding associated with misoprostol for PAC influenced women's contraceptive uptake. However, as PAC programs expand to include misoprostol as a treatment option, accurate and high-quality postabortion contraception counseling and method provision at both treatment and follow-up visits must be strengthened. ","274":"Unsafe abortion contributes to maternal mortality worldwide and disproportionately affects the most disadvantaged women and girls; thus, improving the treatment of complications of abortion is essential. Shifting PAC treatment from sharp dilation and curettage (D&amp;C) to the use of aspiration techniques, notably manual vacuum aspiration (MVA), and medical treatment with misoprostol improves health outcomes. Equally critical is ensuring that women have access to voluntary contraception after an abortion to prevent future unintended pregnancies. In humanitarian settings, access to voluntary family planning to disrupt the cycle of unsafe abortion is even more critical because access to quality services cannot be guaranteed due to security risks, migration, and devastation of infrastructure. Save the Children applied a multipronged postabortion care (PAC) approach in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Somalia, and Yemen that focused on capacity building; assurance of supplies and infrastructure; community collaboration and mobilization; and monitoring and evaluation. Program-level data were extracted for each of the 3 countries from the inception of their program through 2017. The sources of information included monthly service delivery reports that tracked key PAC indicators as well as qualitative data from evaluations of community mobilization activities. The number of PAC clients increased in all countries. In the DRC in 2012, 19% of PAC clients requiring treatment received D&amp;C; in 2017 the percentage was reduced to 3%. In 2013, 25% of all PAC clients in Yemen were treated with D&amp;C; this percentage was reduced to 3% in 2017. The proportion of women choosing contraception after an abortion increased. In 2012, only 42% of all PAC clients in the DRC chose a contraceptive method; by 2017, the proportion had increased to 70%. Somalia had substantial increases in PAC demand, with the percentage of all PAC clients electing contraception increasing from 64% in 2012 to 82% in 2017. In Yemen, where the health system has been constrained due to severe conflict, the percentage of PAC clients choosing voluntary contraception rose from 17% in 2013 to 38% in 2017. Uptake and demand for PAC was mobilized through targeted community outreach in each context. These data demonstrate that providers can effectively shift away from D&amp;C as treatment for PAC and that contraceptive uptake by PAC clients can increase substantially, even in settings where the use of contraception after abortion is often stigmatized.

Drawing from a content analysis of performance-based financing (PBF) implementation manuals, we quantify the extent to which these manuals use a rights perspective to frame family planning services. PBF is an adaptable service purchasing strategy that aims to improve equity and quality of health service provision. PBF can contribute toward achieving global family planning goals and has institutional support from multiple development partners including the Global Financing Facility in support of Every Woman Every Child. A review of 23 PBF implementation manuals finds that all documents are focused largely on the implementation of quality and accountability mechanisms, but few address issues of accessibility, availability, informed choice, acceptability, and\/or nondiscrimination and equity. Notably, operational inclusion of agency, autonomy, empowerment, and\/or voluntarism of health care clients is absent. Based on these findings, we argue that current PBF programs incorporate some mention of rights but are not systematically aligned with a rights-based approach. If PBF programs better reflected the importance of client-centered, rights-based programming, program performance could be improved and risk of infringing rights could be reduced. Given the mixed evidence for PBF benefits and the risk of perverse incentives in earlier PBF programs that were not aligned with rights-based approaches, we argue that greater attention to the rights principles of acceptability, accessibility, availability, and quality; accountability; agency and empowerment; equity and nondiscrimination; informed choice and decision making; participation; and privacy and confidentiality would improve health service delivery and health system performance for all stakeholders with clients at the center. Based on this review, we recommend making the rights-based approach explicit in PBF; progressively operationalizing rights, drawing from local experience; validating rights-based metrics to address measurement gaps; and recognizing the economic value of aligning PBF with rights principles. Such recommendations anchor an aspirational rights agenda with a practical PBF strategy on the need and opportunity for validated metrics.","280":"While measuring, monitoring, and improving supply chain management (SCM) for antiretrovirals (ARVs) is understood at many levels of health systems, a gap remains in the identification and measurement of facility-level practices and behaviors that affect SCM. This study identifies practices and behaviors that are associated with SCM of ARVs at the hospital level and proposes new indicators for measurement. We performed an in-depth literature review to identify facility-level practices and behaviors and existing indicators that are associated with SCM. We used the United States Agency for International Development's 2013 National Supply Chain Assessment Toolkit to define 7 supply chain function areas to frame the study. Qualitative, semistructured key informant and focus group interviews were conducted in hospitals with health professionals from Cameroon, Namibia, and Swaziland to understand facility-level practices and behaviors. Using the results from 54 key informant and focus group interviews from 12 hospitals, we identified 30 practices and behaviors that may affect ARV SCM at the facility level. The following practice areas were particularly associated with SCM: order verification, actions taken when ARV stock is received, changes in prescription and dispensing due to ARV stock-out, actions to ensure patient adherence, and communication with other affiliated facilities and higher-level SCM. We subsequently developed measurable indicators for future research. This study characterizes facility-level practices and behaviors that can affect ARV SCM. It also identifies gaps in their measurement. While this study uses ARVs as a tracer medicine to understand gaps in practices at the facility level, many of the findings are more broadly applicable to other medicines in an integrated setting. This study provides real-world evidence and the groundwork for further research to characterize the link between 30 facility-level practices and behaviors and ARV SCM at the facility and central levels. ","281":null,"282":"Contraceptive prevalence in Nigeria remains among the lowest in the world, which substantially contributes to the country's high maternal and child mortality. Mobile phone technology penetration has increased considerably in Nigeria, opening opportunities for programs to use this medium for reaching their intended audience with health-protective information. In 2017, the Health Communication Capacity Collaborative conducted a cluster-randomized control trial in Kaduna City to assess the efficacy of the digital health tool Smart Client on ideational and behavioral variables related to family planning. Twelve wards in the city were randomly assigned to intervention (6 wards) and control (6 wards) arms of the study. A total of 565 women aged 18-35 years were randomly selected from study wards and consented to participate in the study. At recruitment, the women completed a baseline survey. The women in the intervention group were registered to receive 1 welcome call, 13 program calls, and 3 quiz calls on their mobile phones. Each of the program calls had several segments, including introduction, drama episode, and friend-to-friend chat. The last quiz call included evaluation questions. Women in the control arm received no intervention. The efficacy of the intervention was assessed using both per-protocol and intent-to-treat differences-in-differences techniques. The intervention and control arms were equivalent in terms of key sociodemographic characteristics, with the exception of religion. Attrition was a major challenge in the study. On average, participants receiving the intervention listened to 7.2 drama episodes but only 2.6 personal stories and 1.1 sample dialogues. The results of both per-protocol and intent-to-treat analyses show that the intervention was efficacious in improving relevant ideational and behavioral outcomes. For example, the intent-to-treat results show that the intervention increased women's perceived level of confidence to discuss family planning with a provider by 27.7 percentage points and modern contraceptive prevalence by 14.8 percentage points. This efficacy assessment showed that using an interactive voice response-based digital tool that includes drama is a viable option for promoting positive ideation about family planning and increasing contraceptive use in Nigeria. Significant lessons learned from this efficacy trial include informing participants at the time of recruitment of what the opening segment of the calls will sound like to avoid the calls being mistaken for telemarketing calls and intensive testing prior to scale-up to avoid potential attrition due to technical issues. ","283":"In the era of declining development assistance for health, transitioning externally funded programs to governments becomes a priority for donors. However, the process requires a careful approach not only to preserve the public health gains that have already been achieved but also to expand on them. In the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region, countries are expected to graduate from support from the Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria in or before 2025. We aim to describe transition risks and identify possible means to address them. Using a theory-based conceptual framework-Transition Preparedness Assessment of Tuberculosis and HIV\/AIDS programs-we investigated transition-related challenges through a health systems lens in 10 countries of the Eastern Europe and Central Asia region during 2015-2017. Study findings were derived from systematic collection of quantitative data on socioeconomic indicators and disease epidemics as well as qualitative data from in-depth interviews with 264 stakeholders. These findings were then compared with other donor transition experiences documented elsewhere. We found numerous common transition challenges, such as poor monitoring of a country's macroeconomic performance along with weakness in estimating financial needs for successful transition; limited political will of governments to replace donor-funded programs; punitive legislation criminalizing certain behaviors and constraining the government's ability to allocate funds and contract civil society organizations essential to providing services for key populations; limited coordination function of governments and weak decision-making power of coordinating mechanisms obscuring the latter's future role; and inadequate function of national procurement and supply chain management systems undermining an uninterrupted supply of quality-assured drugs and commodities. These challenges are compounded by the risks related to health workforce management leading to specialist shortages and\/or inadequately skilled and qualified professionals and by limited funding for critical surveillance activities. The complex and multidimensional transition process requires a multipronged approach through well-planned collective and coordinated responses from global, bilateral, and national partners in coming years. Other similar transition processes may provide guidance. Although no \"one-size-fits-all\" approach exists, previous experiences highlight a need for both early planning and monitoring of the transition along several key dimensions. Issues that could threaten the maintenance of health gains include ongoing stigma against key populations; continued heavy reliance on external funding in some countries, especially for preventive services; the institutional viability of the country coordinating mechanisms; and emerging difficulties with procurement of quality drugs at reasonable prices. ","284":"Donors and others are concerned that implants procured under the Family Planning 2020 Initiative exceed the number sought by clients, resulting in accumulating stocks. To explore this issue, we examined 3 questions across 9 countries: (1) How accurate were procurement quantities given requirements for filling supply chains for the rapidly growing implant programs? (2) Is there a standard factor that can be applied to consumption data to predict procurement volumes required? (3) How accurately do demographic estimates mirror dispensed-to-client data? We created a model incorporating public-sector supply chain system parameters to calculate system \"imputed\" inventory and the system \"filled-to-max\" inventory. Comparing results determined the adequacy of the procurement quantities. The proportion of consumption that the filled-to-max inventory represented through time suggests whether a standard factor can be applied to consumption to predict necessary procurement volumes. We compared demographic estimates to consumption data to determine the usability of the former in predicting demand. According to model results, 3 of the 9 countries came close to procuring accurate quantities over the study period between 2010 and 2017, 4 had procurement volumes lower than what was required to fill the supply chain to maximum inventory requirement levels, and 2 had volumes that exceeded the need. We found no standard factor for relating inventory quantities to consumption rates across countries, given that inventory needs can vary based on system design parameters and the rates of growth or decline in consumption. Finally, we observed that our demographic estimates were on average lower than the dispensed-to-client data in the 6 countries for which these data were available. Study results show that the significant investments in procurement quantities for the rapidly growing implant programs were justified based on consumption and system design. This research should assure observers that rapid increases in implant procurement quantities (where data are available) have generally not resulted in overstocks of the system to date. It suggests that the relationship between procurement quantities and consumption levels cannot be accurately assessed without understanding the country supply chain, inventory control parameters, and current and future demand.","285":"Preterm birth, a leading cause of neonatal mortality, has the highest burden in low-income countries. In 2015, the World Health Organization (WHO) published recommendations for interventions to improve preterm outcomes. Our analysis uses the Maternal and Neonatal Directed Assessment of Technology (MANDATE) model to evaluate the potential effects that WHO-recommended interventions could have had on preterm mortality in sub-Saharan Africa in 2015. We modeled preterm birth subconditions causing mortality (respiratory distress syndrome, intraventricular hemorrhage, necrotizing enterocolitis, sepsis, birth asphyxia, and low birth weight). For each subcondition, models were populated with estimates of WHO-recommended intervention prevalence, case fatality, coverage, and efficacy. Various scenarios modeled improved coverage of single and combined interventions compared with baseline. In 2015, approximately 500,000 neonatal deaths due to preterm birth occurred in sub-Saharan Africa. Single interventions with the greatest impact on preterm mortality included oxygen\/continuous positive airway pressure (44,000 lives saved), cord care (38,500 lives saved), and breastfeeding (30,200 lives saved). Combined with improved diagnosis\/transfer to a hospital, the impact of interventions showed greater reductions in mortality (oxygen\/continuous positive airway pressure, 134,100 lives saved; antibiotics, 28,600 lives saved). Combined interventions had the greatest impact. Together, hospital delivery with comprehensive care for respiratory distress syndrome saved 190,600 lives, and comprehensive thermal care, breastfeeding, and prevention\/treatment for sepsis saved 94,400 lives. In 2015, WHO-recommended interventions could have saved the lives of nearly 300,000 infants born preterm in sub-Saharan Africa. Combined interventions are necessary to maximize impact. Mathematical models such as MANDATE can estimate effects on health outcomes to allow health officials to prioritize implementation strategies. ","286":"Sub-Saharan African correctional facilities concentrate large numbers of people who are living with HIV or at risk for HIV infection. Universal test and treat (UTT) is widely recognized as a promising approach to improve the health of individuals and a population health strategy to reduce new HIV infections. In this study, we explored the feasibility and sustainability of implementing UTT in correctional facilities in Zambia and South Africa. Nested within a UTT implementation research study, our qualitative evaluation of feasibility and sustainability used a case-comparison design based on data from 1 Zambian and 3 South African correctional facilities. Primary data from in-depth interviews with incarcerated individuals, correctional managers, health care providers, and policy makers were supplemented by public policy documents, study documentation, and implementation memos in both countries. Thematic analysis was informed by an empirically established conceptual framework for health system analysis. Despite different institutional profiles, we were able to successfully introduce UTT in the South Africa and Zambian correctional facilities participating in the study. A supportive policy backdrop was important to UTT implementation and establishment in both countries. However, sustainability of UTT, defined as relevant government departments' capacity to independently plan, resource, and administer quality UTT, differed. South Africa's correctional facilities had existing systems to deliver and monitor chronic HIV care and treatment, forming a \"scaffolding\" for sustained UTT despite some human resources shortages and poorly integrated health information systems. Notwithstanding recent improvements, Zambia's correctional health system demonstrated insufficient material and technical capacity to independently deliver quality UTT. In the correctional facilities of both countries, inmate population dynamics and their impact on HIV-related stigma were important factors in UTT service uptake. Findings demonstrate the critical role of policy directives, health service delivery systems, adequate resourcing, and population dynamics on the feasibility and likely sustainability of UTT in corrections in Zambia and South Africa. ","287":null,"288":"","289":"","290":"Observational studies raise concern about a potential link between injectable progestin contraceptive use and HIV acquisition risk. This possible link is particularly relevant in sub-Saharan Africa where HIV risk is high and the method mix is skewed toward injectables. We developed the Planning for Outcomes (P4O) model (https:\/\/planning4outcomes.ctiexchange.org\/) to predict changes in maternal and child health (MCH) and HIV outcomes that could occur if the proportion of injectables in the method mix is changed. P4O incorporates evidence-based assumptions to predict yearly changes in unintended pregnancies, morbidity\/mortality, HIV infections (women and infants), and anticipated health care costs associated with changing the proportions of injectable users in 22 selected countries. Users of this model designate all countries or a subset and adjust inputs including percentage of injectable users who discontinue, percentage of discontinuers who begin use of an alternative method, hazard ratio for HIV infection with injectable use, method mix used by injectable discontinuers, annual probabilities of method-specific pregnancy and mother-to-child transmission of HIV, condom effectiveness against HIV, risk of HIV during pregnancy, and HIV incidence among women of reproductive age. Illustrative results from all sub-Saharan African countries combined and from selected countries demonstrate the potential of P4O to inform program planning and procurement decisions. In countries with high use of long-acting reversible contraception, the removal of injectables from the method mix is associated with improvement in MCH and HIV indicators if most injectable users switch to more effective methods (e.g., implants). In countries with high use of short-acting methods (e.g., condoms), the model predicts mostly negative MCH outcomes. Policy makers and program planners may use P4O to inform programming and policy decisions. In all scenarios, programmatic preparation to accommodate changes to the contraceptive method mix, considerations of how the individual desires of women will be addressed, and potential burden of anticipated MCH-related costs warrant advanced consideration. ","291":null,"292":"The Republic of Benin faces high maternal, newborn, and child mortality; low modern contraceptive use; and a critical shortage of health workers. In 2013, the Government of Benin made 3 reproductive health commitments to improve national health indicators, including expanding provision of family planning services at the community level through task sharing. Since 2016, the Advancing Partners &amp; Communities (APC) project has been helping the Benin Ministry of Health (MOH) provide subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC; brand name Sayana Press) through facility-based health care providers and community health workers known as relais communautaires (RCs). DMPA-SC is an easy-to-administer, discreet injectable contraceptive that provides 3 months of protection from pregnancy. Beginning in May 2017, the government introduced DMPA-SC through a phased approach in 10 health zones, which encompassed 149 health centers and 614 villages. Between June 2017 and June 2018, the MOH and APC trained 278 facility-based providers and 917 RCs to provide DMPA-SC, and nearly 11,000 doses were subsequently administered to 7,997 women at facilities and in communities. This article presents findings from an assessment of community-level and health facility service data collected during the first 13 months of DMPA-SC introduction in Benin. Because of this intervention, nearly 35,000 women received family planning counseling and 7,997 women chose DMPA-SC. At the community level, 3,111 DMPA-SC users were first-time users of modern contraception. The initial success of the DMPA-SC rollout in Benin shows promise for helping the country meet its reproductive health commitments.","293":"We evaluated the effectiveness of a cell phone counseling intervention to promote retention in care and HIV testing of infants among women with HIV accessing prevention of mother-to-child services in Kisumu, Kenya. Between May 2013 and September 2015, we recruited 404 pregnant women with HIV who were between 14 and 36 weeks of gestation and randomly assigned them to the intervention (n=207) or control arm (n=197). Retention was assessed at delivery and at 6 and 14 weeks postpartum. We also measured uptake of infant HIV testing. The intervention comprised a fixed protocol of counselor-delivered phone calls to provide one-to-one need-based support. The number of calls made varied depending on when participants presented for antenatal care services; the maximum number was 42. The control group received routine care. We evaluated retention at 3 time points using the complementary log-log regression model taking into account factors associated with retention and loss to follow-up time. We calculated the incidence rate for HIV transmission among infants and used binary logistic regression to identify predictors of HIV infection among infants. Participants attended on average 63% of the required number of counseling calls during the study period. Retention was higher in the intervention arm than the control arm at delivery (95.2% vs. 77.7%, respectively); 6 weeks postpartum (93.9% vs. 72.9%, respectively); and 14 weeks postpartum (83.3% vs. 66.5%, respectively) (P&lt;.001). The counseling intervention (hazard ratio [HR]=0.29; 95% confidence interval [CI]=0.12, 0.69) and positive health perceptions (HR=0.99; 95% CI=0.98, 1.00) were associated with lower hazards of being lost to follow-up. HIV testing of infants was higher in the intervention than control arm (93% vs. 68%, respectively; P&lt;.001). In total, 9 of 308 (2.9%) infants tested positive for HIV infection (incidence rate=0.39 infections\/100 infant-weeks). Medication Possession Ratio (MPR) &gt;90%, used to assess adherence to ART, was associated with lower odds of a positive HIV test among infants (adjusted odds ratio=0.20; 95% CI=0.04, 0.99). Attendance at antenatal and postnatal care visits was higher among participants in the intervention arm than the control arm. The one-on-one tailored counseling delivered via cell phone was effective in retaining mothers with HIV infection in care and promoting uptake of infant HIV testing and antenatal and postnatal care services. Phone counseling offers a practical approach to reach and retain pregnant women with HIV infection and postpartum mothers in care, but greater emphasis on collection of medications and adherence is required. ","294":"","295":"Employing voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) within traditional settings may increase patient safety and help scale up male circumcision efforts in sub-Saharan Africa. In Zimbabwe, the VaRemba are among the few ethnic groups that practice traditional male circumcision, often in suboptimal hygienic environments. ZAZIC, a local consortium, and the Zimbabwe Ministry of Health and Child Care (MoHCC) established a successful, culturally sensitive partnership with the VaRemba to provide safe, standardized male circumcision procedures and reduce adverse events (AEs) during traditional male circumcision initiation camps. The foundation for the VaRemba Camp Collaborative (VCC) was established over a 4-year period, between 2013 and 2017, with support from a wide group of stakeholders. Initially, ZAZIC supported VaRemba traditional male circumcisions by providing key commodities and transport to help ensure patient safety. Subsequently, 2 male VaRemba nurses were trained in VMMC according to national MoHCC guidelines to enable medical male circumcision within the camp. To increase awareness and uptake of VMMC at the upcoming August-September 2017 camp, ZAZIC then worked closely with a trained team of circumcised VaRemba men to create demand for VMMC. Non-VaRemba ZAZIC doctors were granted permission by VaRemba leaders to provide oversight of VMMC procedures and postoperative treatment for all moderate and severe AEs within the camp setting. Of 672 male camp residents ages 10 and older, 657 (98%) chose VMMC. Only 3 (0.5%) moderate infections occurred among VMMC clients; all were promptly treated and healed well. Although the successful collaboration required many years of investment to build trust with community leaders and members, it ultimately resulted in a successful model that paired traditional circumcision practices with modern VMMC, suggesting potential for replicability in other similar sub-Saharan African communities.","296":"In Colombia, as in many Latin American countries, decision making and development of effective strategies for vector control of urban diseases such as dengue, Zika, and chikungunya is challenging for local health authorities. The heterogeneity of transmission in urban areas requires an efficient risk-based allocation of resources to control measures. With the objective of strengthening the capacity of local surveillance systems to identify variables that favor urban arboviral transmission, a multidisciplinary research team collaborated with the local Secretary of Health officials of 3 municipalities in Colombia (Giron, Yopal, and Buga), in the design of an integrated information system called VECTOS from 2015 to 2018. Information and communication technologies were used to develop 2 mobile applications to capture entomological and social information, as well as a web-based system for the collection, geo-referencing, and integrated information analysis using free geospatial software. This system facilitates the capture and analysis of epidemiological information from the Colombian national surveillance system (SIVIGILA), periodic entomological surveys-mosquito larvae and pupae in premises and peridomestic breeding sites-and surveys of knowledge, attitudes, and practices (KAP) in a spatial and temporal context at the neighborhood level. The data collected in VECTOS are mapped and visualized in graphical reports. The system enables real-time monitoring of weekly epidemiological indicators, entomological indices, and social surveys. Additionally, the system enables risk stratification of neighborhoods, using selected epidemiological, entomological, demographic, and environmental variables. This article describes the VECTOS system and the lessons learned during its development and use. The joint analysis of epidemiological and entomological data within a geographic information system in VECTOS gives better insight to the routinely collected data and identifies the heterogeneity of risk factors between neighborhoods. We expect the system to continue to strengthen vector control programs in evidence-based decision making and in the design and enhanced follow-up of vector control strategies.","297":"The emergence of the Zika virus (ZIKV) in Latin America and the Caribbean during the 2015-2016 outbreak has required local health systems to adapt, suddenly and continuously. This field action report explores the outbreak's sexual and reproductive health (SRH) complexities and the experience of the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF) and 4 of its member associations as part of the United States Agency for International Development's rapid response in the region. It outlines approaches and actions that IPPF and its member associations undertook over 3 broad programmatic phases-developing ZIKV protocols and training personnel; delivering ZIKV-integrated services and information; and providing screening, care, and support for children and families affected by congenital Zika syndrome (CZS)-as the project worked to integrate ZIKV prevention, screening, and response within SRH service delivery models. It also describes the challenges and lessons learned in implementing a ZIKV response program in the region and recommendations from a service delivery perspective that can be useful in informing the responses to future rapid onset epidemics with SRH relevance. Challenges identified include adapting to a rapidly evolving evidence base during the early stages of the epidemic; traditional and restrictive regional social norms around gender, sex, and sexuality; the lack of focus on sexual transmission in national ZIKV public health messaging; and a lack of services, government support, and referral pathways for supporting children and families affected by CZS. Some of the key recommendations include finding ways to share rapidly evolving clinical updates conveniently and frequently, such as through digital technologies and platforms; partnering with multidisciplinary organizations, such as disability rights and services organizations, that can fill gaps in needed services; and leveraging the need for urgent action as a catalyst of change around more inclusive and gender-transformative social norms and services.","298":"Among the many challenges facing health systems grappling with the explosive growth of chronic disease in Africa are continuity of care, particularly in poor, rural areas. We report the strategy, field experience, and results of an ongoing 6-year follow-up program operating in a rural district hospital in Kisoro, Uganda, that attempts to locate and reengage patients lost to follow-up (LTFU) from communities that are largely without phones, addresses, or paved roads. The program works with diverse hospital clinics, including chronic diseases, HIV, tuberculosis (TB), nutrition, and women's health, to identify patients who have not returned to care, employing a modest staff who spend about 20 days monthly making outreach visits by motorcycle in search of approximately 130 patients. We describe the organization of this unique \"horizontal\" program and report on follow-up outcomes between November 2015 to October 2016. Between 30% and 60% of patients were found to have lapses in care. The follow-up program was able to locate 64% of patients, with a reengagement rate of 54% to 92% (average, 69%) depending on the clinic. The program costs approximately US$5 per patient LTFU but about US$40 per patient maintained in care. The hospital-based follow-up program that cuts across diverse clinics and wards was novel and feasible in this rural sub-Saharan African setting.","299":"Mozambique has a high maternal mortality ratio, and postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) is a leading cause of maternal deaths. In 2015, the Mozambican Ministry of Health (MOH) commenced a program to distribute misoprostol at the community level in selected districts as a strategy to reduce PPH. This case study uses the ExpandNet\/World Health Organization (WHO) scale-up framework to examine the planning, management, and outcomes of the early expansion phase of the scale-up of misoprostol for the prevention of PPH in 2 provinces in Mozambique. Qualitative semistructured interviews were conducted between February and October 2017 in 5 participating districts in 2 provinces. Participants included program stakeholders, health staff, community health workers (CHWs), and traditional birth attendants (TBAs). Interviews were analyzed using the ExpandNet\/WHO framework alongside national policy and planning documents and notes from a 2017 national Ministry of Health maternal, newborn, and child health workshop. Outcomes were estimated using misoprostol coverage and access in 2017 for both provinces. The study revealed a number of barriers and facilitators to scale-up. Facilitators included a supportive political and legal environment; a clear, credible, and relevant innovation; early expansion into some Ministry of Health systems and a strong network of CHWs and TBAs. Barriers included a reduction in reach due to a shift from universal distribution to application of eligibility criteria; fear of misdirecting misoprostol for abortion or labor induction; limited communication and understanding of the national PPH prevention strategy; inadequate monitoring and evaluation; challenges with logistics systems; and the inability to engage remote TBAs. Lower coverage was found in Inhambane province than Nampula province, possibly due to NGO support and political champions. This study identified the need for a formal review of the misoprostol program to identify adaptations and to develop a systematic scale-up strategy to guide national scale-up. ","300":"Private physicians in India see and treat more than half of all people with tuberculosis (TB) each year and thus have potential to make significant contributions to TB control. The EQUIP project was designed as a prospective cohort study to assess the potential of private providers to diagnose and appropriately treat drug-resistant TB (DR-TB) in the Central and South districts of Chennai, India. The private-sector engagement model consisted of free access to rapid diagnostics; choice of free daily or thrice-weekly treatment regimens; support for notification of patients; and patient support including directly observed therapy through EQUIP centers staffed by a community-based interface agency. Data were collected on provider participation; referral results; treatment regimens prescribed; and treatment outcomes. From October 2015 through June 2017, 227 of the 466 (48.7%) private providers approached referred at least 1 patient to an EQUIP center for evaluation. A total of 2,621 patients received testing and 1,232 (47.0%) were diagnosed with TB. Of those, 727 (59.0%) were bacteriologically confirmed, including 694 (56.3%) using GeneXpert and 33 (2.7%) using smear microscopy. A total of 26 (3.7% of GeneXpert diagnosed) patients were confirmed as rifampicin-resistant cases. EQUIP-related notifications comprised approximately 10% of TB and DR-TB notifications in Chennai during the project period. The project initiated 1,167 (96.8%) drug-sensitive TB patients on treatment. Of those, 691 (59.2%) received standard daily regimens with EQUIP support and 288 (24.7%) received standard intermittent regimens. At the time of writing, 89.4% of 868 drug-susceptible TB patients receiving EQUIP support had treatment success. Of the 26 rifampicin-resistant TB cases notified, 20 (77%) started and continued on second-line treatment; 2 died and 4 were lost to follow-up prior to treatment initiation. Private providers can make a substantial contribution to detection and appropriate treatment of patients with TB and DR-TB in India when provided with access to rapid diagnostics, support for notification and patient treatment through interface agencies, and free, quality anti-TB drugs.

Saving Mothers, Giving Life (SMGL) was designed in 2011 within the Global Health Initiative as a public-private partnership between the U.S. government, Merck for Mothers, Every Mother Counts, the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the government of Norway, and Project C.U.R.E. SMGL's initial aim was to dramatically reduce maternal mortality in low-resource, high-burden sub-Saharan African countries. SMGL used a district health systems strengthening approach combining both supply- and demand-side interventions to address the 3 key delays to accessing effective maternity care in a timely manner: delays in seeking, reaching, and receiving quality obstetric services. The SMGL approach was piloted from June 2012 to December 2013 in 8 rural districts (4 each) in Uganda and Zambia with high levels of maternal deaths. Over the next 4 years, SMGL expanded to a total of 13 districts in Uganda and 18 in Zambia. SMGL built on existing host government and private maternal and child health platforms, and was aligned with and guided by Ugandan and Zambian maternal and newborn health policies and programs. A 35% reduction in the maternal mortality ratio (MMR) was achieved in SMGL-designated facilities in both countries during the first 12 months of implementation. Maternal health outcomes achieved after 5 years of implementation in the SMGL-designated pilot districts were substantial: a 44% reduction in both facility and districtwide MMR in Uganda, and a 38% decrease in facility and a 41% decline in districtwide MMR in Zambia. Facility deliveries increased by 47% (from 46% to 67%) in Uganda and by 44% (from 62% to 90%) in Zambia. Cesarean delivery rates also increased: by 71% in Uganda (from 5.3% to 9.0%) and by 79% in Zambia (from 2.7% to 4.8%). The average annual rate of reduction for maternal deaths in the SMGL-supported districts exceeded that found countrywide: 11.5% versus 3.5% in Uganda and 10.5% versus 2.8% in Zambia. The changes in stillbirth rates were significant (-13% in Uganda and -36% in Zambia) but those for pre-discharge neonatal mortality rates were not significant in either Uganda or Zambia. A district health systems strengthening approach to addressing the 3 delays to accessing timely, appropriate, high-quality care for pregnant women can save women's lives from preventable causes and reduce stillbirths.

A total of 731 women presenting to clinic-based providers (CBPs) at 6 Ministry of Health clinics or to community health workers (CHWs) in rural communities were randomized to receive DMPA-SC administered by a provider or be trained to self-inject DMPA-SC. Data collectors contacted women after the reinjection window at 3, 6, and 9 months to collect data on discontinuation and women's experiences. Twelve months after enrollment or at early discontinuation, women had their final interview, including pregnancy testing. We compared continuation, pregnancy, and safety by whether DMPA-SC or self-injection training was provided by CHWs versus CBPs. We also conducted an exploratory analysis assessing the association between women's sociodemographic factors and the risk for discontinuation using stratified Cox proportional hazards models. The type of provider did not seem to influence continuation, pregnancy, or safety. As reported previously, women in the self-injection group were significantly less likely to discontinue the method compared with women in the provider-administered group (hazard ratio, 0.43; P&lt;.001). The risk for discontinuation was also different among health facility catchment sites (P&lt;.001). No other assessed sociodemographic factors were found to significantly influence the risk for discontinuation. Public-sector CHWs can safely and effectively provide DMPA-SC and train women to self-inject DMPA-SC in low-resource settings.

","306":"","307":"Saving Mothers, Giving Life (SMGL) significantly reduced maternal and perinatal mortality in Uganda and Zambia by using a district health systems strengthening approach to address the key delays women and newborns face in receiving quality, timely, and appropriate medical care. This article documents the transition of SMGL from pilot to scale in Uganda and Zambia and analyzes the sustainability of the approach, examining the likelihood of maintaining positive trends in maternal and newborn health in both countries. We analyzed the potential sustainment of SMGL achievements using a tool adapted from the HIV-focused domains and elements of the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief Sustainability Index and Dashboard for maternal and neonatal health pro-gramming adding a domain on community normative change. Information for each of the 5 resulting domains was drawn from SMGL and non-SMGL reports, individual stakeholder interviews, and group discussions. In both Uganda and Zambia, the SMGL proof-of-concept phase catalyzed commitment to saving mothers and newborns and a renewed belief that significant change is possible. Increased leadership and accountability for maternal and newborn health, particularly at the district and facility levels, was bolstered by routine maternal death surveillance reviews that engaged a wide range of local leadership. The SMGL district-strengthening model was found to be cost-effective with cost of death averted estimated at US$177-206 per year of life gained. When further considering the ripple effect that saving a mother has on child survival and the household economy, the value of SMGL increases. Ministries of health and donor agencies have already demonstrated a willingness to pay this amount per year of life for other programs, such as HIV and AIDS. As SMGL scaled up in both Uganda and Zambia, the intentional integration of SMGL interventions into host country systems, alignment with other large-scale programs, and planned reductions in annual SMGL funding all contributed to increasing host government ownership of the interventions and set the SMGL approach on a path more likely to be sustained following the close of the initiative. Lessons from the learning districts resulted in increased efficiency in allocation of resources for maternal and newborn health, better use of strategic information, improved management capacities, and increased community engagement. ","308":"Uganda's maternal and newborn mortality remains high at 336 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births and 27 newborn deaths per 1,000 live births. The Saving Mothers, Giving Life (SMGL) initiative launched in 2012 by the U.S. government and partners, with funding from the U.S. President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief, focused on reducing maternal and newborn deaths in Uganda and Zambia by addressing the 3 major delays associated with maternal and newborn deaths. In Uganda, SMGL was implemented in 2 phases. Phase 1 was a proof-of-concept demonstration in 4 districts of Western Uganda (2012 to 2014). Phase 2 involved scaling up best practices from Phase 1 to new sites in Northern Uganda (2014 to 2017). The SMGL project used a systems-strengthening approach with quality improvement (QI) methods applied in targeted facilities with high client volume and high maternal and perinatal deaths. A QI team was formed in each facility to address the building blocks of the World Health Organization's health systems framework. A community component was integrated within the facility-level QI work to create demand for services. Above-site health systems functions were strengthened through engagement with district management teams. The institutional maternal mortality ratio in the intervention facilities decreased by 20%, from 138 to 109 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births between December 2014 and December 2016. The institutional neonatal mortality rate was reduced by 30%, while the fresh stillbirth rate declined by 47% and the perinatal mortality rate by 26%. During this period, over 90% of pregnant women were screened for hypertension and 70% for syphilis during antenatal care services. All women received a uterotonic drug to prevent postpartum hemorrhage during delivery, and about 90% of the women were monitored using a partograph during labor. Identifying barriers at each step of delivering care and strengthening health systems functions using QI teams increase partcipation, resulting in improved care for mothers and newborns. ","309":"Interventions for the Saving Mothers, Giving Life (SMGL) initiative aimed to ensure all pregnant women in SMGL-supported districts have timely access to emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC). Spatial travel-time analyses provide a visualization of changes in timely access. We compared travel-time estimates to EmONC health facilities in SMGL-supported districts in western Uganda in 2012, 2013, and 2016. To examine EmONC access, we analyzed a categorical variable of travel-time duration in 30-minute increments. Data sources included health facility assessments, geographic coordinates of EmONC facilities, geolocated population estimates of women of reproductive age (WRA), and other road network and geographic sources. The number of EmONC facilities almost tripled between 2012 and 2016, increasing geographic access to EmONC. Estimated travel time to EmONC facilities declined significantly during the 5-year period. The proportion of WRA able to access any EmONC and comprehensive EmONC (CEmONC) facility within 2 hours by motorcycle increased by 18% (from 61.3% to 72.1%, P &lt; .01) and 37% (from 51.1% to 69.8%, P &lt; .01), respectively from baseline to 2016. Similar increases occurred among WRA accessing EmONC and CEmONC respectively if 4-wheeled vehicles (14% and 31% increase, P &lt; .01) could be used. Increases in timely access were also substantial for nonmotorized transportation such as walking and\/or bicycling. Largely due to the SMGL-supported expansion of EmONC capability, timely access to EmONC significantly improved. Our analysis developed a geographic outline of facility accessibility using multiple types of transportation. Spatial travel-time analyses, along with other EmONC indicators, can be used by planners and policy makers to estimate need and target underserved populations to achieve further gains in EmONC accessibility. In addition to increasing the number and geographic distribution of EmONC facilities, complementary efforts to make motorized transportation available are necessary to achieve meaningful increases in EmONC access. ","310":"Saving Mothers, Giving Life (SMGL), a health systems strengthening approach based on the 3-delays model, aimed to reduce maternal and perinatal mortality in 6 districts in Zambia between 2012 and 2017. By 2016, the maternal mortality ratio in SMGL-supported districts declined by 41% compared to its level at the beginning of SMGL-from 480 to 284 deaths per 100,000 live births. The 10.5% annual reduction between the baseline and 2016 was about 4.5 times higher than the annual reduction rate for sub-Saharan Africa and about 2.6 times higher than the annual reduction estimated for Zambia as a whole. While outcome measures demonstrate reductions in maternal and perinatal mortality, this qualitative endline evaluation assessed community perceptions of the SMGL intervention package, including (1) messaging about use of maternal health services, (2) access to maternal health services, and (3) quality improvement of maternal health services. We used purposive sampling to conduct semistructured in-depth interviews with women who delivered at home (n=20), women who delivered in health facilities (n=20), community leaders (n=8), clinicians (n=15), and public health stakeholders (n=15). We also conducted 12 focus group discussions with a total of 93 men and women from the community and Safe Motherhood Action Group members. Data were coded and analyzed using NVivo version 10. Delay 1: Participants were receptive to SMGL's messages related to early antenatal care, health facility-based deliveries, and involving male partners in pregnancy and childbirth. However, top-down pressure to increase health facility deliveries led to unintended consequences, such as community-imposed penalty fees for home deliveries. Delay 2: Community members perceived some improvements, such as refurbished maternity waiting homes and dedicated maternity ambulances, but many still had difficulty reaching the health facilities in time to deliver. Delay 3: SMGL's clinician trainings were considered a strength, but the increased demand for health facility deliveries led to human resource challenges, which affected perceived quality of care. While SMGL's health systems strengthening approach aimed to reduce challenges related to the 3 delays, participants still reported significant barriers accessing maternal and newborn health care. More research is needed to understand the necessary intervention package to affect system-wide change. ","311":"Public-private partnerships (PPPs) have garnered appeal among governments around the world, making impressive contributions to health resource mobilization and improved health outcomes. Saving Mothers, Giving Life (SMGL), a PPP aimed at reducing maternal deaths, was born out of the need to mobilize new actors, capitalize on diverse strengths, and marshal additional resources. A qualitative study was initiated to examine how the SMGL partnership functioned to achieve mortality reduction goals and foster country ownership and sustainability. We purposively selected 57 individuals from U.S. and global public and private partner organizations engaged in SMGL in Uganda and Zambia for qualitative in-depth interviews. Representative selection was based on participant knowledge of partner activities and engagement with the partnership at various points in time. Of those invited, 46 agreed to participate. Transcripts were double-coded, and discordant codes were resolved by consensus. Several recurring themes emerged from our study. Perceived strengths of the partnership included goal alignment; diversity in partner expertise; high-quality monitoring, evaluation, and learning; and strong leadership and country ownership. These strengths helped SMGL achieve its goals in reducing maternal and newborn mortality. However, uncertainty in roles and responsibilities, perceived power inequities between partners, bureaucratic processes, a compressed timeline, and limited representation from ministries of health in the SMGL governance structure were reported impediments. While SMGL faced many of the same challenges experienced by other PPPs, local counterparts and the SMGL partners were able to address many of these issues and the partnership was ultimately praised for being a successful model of interagency coordination. Efforts to facilitate country ownership and short-term financial sustainability have been put in place for many elements of the SMGL approach; however, long-term financing is still a challenge for SMGL as well as other global health PPPs. Addressing key impediments outlined in this study may improve long-term sustainability of similar PPPs. ","312":"The primary objective of this study was to estimate the costs and the incremental cost-effectiveness of maternal and newborn care associated with the Saving Mothers, Giving Life (SMGL) initiative-a comprehensive district-strengthening approach addressing the 3 delays associated with maternal mortality-in Uganda and Zambia. To assess effectiveness, we used a before-after design comparing facility outcome data from 2012 (before) and 2016 (after). To estimate costs, we used unit costs collected from comparison districts in 2016 coupled with data on health services utilization from 2012 in SMGL-supported districts to estimate the costs before the start of SMGL. We collected data from health facilities, ministerial health offices, and implementing partners for the year 2016 in 2 SMGL-supported districts in each country and in 3 comparison non-SMGL districts (2 in Zambia, 1 in Uganda). Incremental costs for maternal and newborn health care per SMGL-supported district in 2016 was estimated to be US$845,000 in Uganda and $760,000 in Zambia. The incremental cost per delivery was estimated to be $38 in Uganda and $95 in Zambia. For the districts included in this study, SMGL maternal and newborn health activities were associated with approximately 164 deaths averted in Uganda and 121 deaths averted in Zambia in 2016 compared to 2012. In Uganda, the cost per death averted was $10,311, or $177 per life-year gained. In Zambia, the cost per death averted was $12,514, or $206 per life-year gained. The SMGL approach can be very cost-effective, with the cost per life-year gained as a percentage of the gross domestic product (GDP) being 25.6% and 16.4% in Uganda and Zambia, respectively. In terms of affordability, the SMGL approach could be paid for by increasing health spending from 7.3% to 7.5% of GDP in Uganda and from 5.4% to 5.8% in Zambia.","313":"Saving Mothers, Giving Life (SMGL) is a 5-year initiative implemented in participating districts in Uganda and Zambia that aimed to reduce deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth by targeting the 3 delays to receiving appropriate care: seeking, reaching, and receiving. Approaches to addressing the third delay included adequate health facility infrastructure, specifically sufficient equipment and medications; trained providers to provide quality evidence-based care; support for referrals to higher-level care; and effective maternal and perinatal death surveillance and response. SMGL used a mixed-methods approach to describe intervention strategies, outcomes, and health impacts. Programmatic and monitoring and evaluation data-health facility assessments, facility and community surveillance, and population-based mortality studies-were used to document the effectiveness of intervention components. During the SMGL initiative, the proportion of facilities providing emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) increased from 10% to 25% in Uganda and from 6% to 12% in Zambia. Correspondingly, the delivery rate occurring in EmONC facilities increased from 28.2% to 41.0% in Uganda and from 26.0% to 29.1% in Zambia. Nearly all facilities had at least one trained provider on staff by the endline evaluation. Staffing increases allowed a higher proportion of health centers to provide care 24 hours a day\/7 days a week by endline-from 74.6% to 82.9% in Uganda and from 64.8% to 95.5% in Zambia. During this period, referral communication improved from 93.3% to 99.0% in Uganda and from 44.6% to 100% in Zambia, and data systems to identify and analyze causes of maternal and perinatal deaths were established and strengthened. SMGL's approach was associated with improvements in facility infrastructure, equipment, medication, access to skilled staff, and referral mechanisms and led to declines in facility maternal and perinatal mortality rates. Further work is needed to sustain these gains and to eliminate preventable maternal and perinatal deaths. ","314":"Between June 2011 and December 2016, the Saving Mothers, Giving Life (SMGL) initiative in Uganda and Zambia implemented a comprehensive approach targeting the persistent barriers that impact a woman's decision to seek care (first delay), ability to reach care (second delay), and ability to receive adequate care (third delay). This article addresses how SMGL partners implemented strategies specifically targeting the second delay, including decreasing the distance to facilities capable of managing emergency obstetric and newborn complications, ensuring sufficient numbers of skilled birth attendants, and addressing transportation challenges. Both quantitative and qualitative data collected by SMGL implementing partners for the purpose of monitoring and evaluation were used to document the intervention strategies and to describe the change in outputs and outcomes related to the second delay. Quantitative data sources included pregnancy outcome monitoring data in facilities, health facility assessments, and population-based surveys. Qualitative data were derived from population-level verbal autopsy narratives, programmatic reports and SMGL-related publications, and partner-specific evaluations that include focus group discussions and in-depth interviews. The proportion of deliveries in any health facility or hospital increased from 46% to 67% in Uganda and from 63% to 90% in Zambia between baseline and endline. Distance to health facilities was reduced by increasing the number of health facilities capable of providing basic emergency obstetric and newborn care services in both Uganda and Zambia-a 200% and 167% increase, respectively. Access to facilities improved through integrated transportation and communication services efforts. In Uganda there was a 6% increase in the number of health facilities with communication equipment and a 258% increase in facility deliveries supported by transportation vouchers. In Zambia, there was a 31% increase in health facilities with available transportation, and the renovation and construction of maternity waiting homes resulted in a 69% increase in the number of health facilities with associated maternity waiting homes. The collective SMGL strategies addressing the second delay resulted in increased access to delivery services as seen by the increase in the proportion of facility deliveries in SMGL districts, improved communication and transportation services, and an increase in the number of facilities with associated maternity waiting homes. Sustaining and improving on these efforts will need to be ongoing to continue to address the second delay in Uganda and Zambia. ","315":"Saving Mothers, Giving Life (SMGL), a 5-year initiative implemented in selected districts in Uganda and Zambia, was designed to reduce deaths related to pregnancy and childbirth by targeting the 3 delays to receiving appropriate care at birth. While originally the \"Three Delays\" model was designed to focus on curative services that encompass emergency obstetric care, SMGL expanded its application to primary and secondary prevention of obstetric complications. Prevention of the \"first delay\" focused on addressing factors influencing the decision to seek delivery care at a health facility. Numerous factors can contribute to the first delay, including a lack of birth planning, unfamiliarity with pregnancy danger signs, poor perceptions of facility care, and financial or geographic barriers. SMGL addressed these barriers through community engagement on safe motherhood, public health outreach, community workers who identified pregnant women and encouraged facility delivery, and incentives to deliver in a health facility. SMGL used qualitative and quantitative methods to describe intervention strategies, intervention outcomes, and health impacts. Partner reports, health facility assessments (HFAs), facility and community surveillance, and population-based mortality studies were used to document activities and measure health outcomes in SMGL-supported districts. SMGL's approach led to unprecedented community outreach on safe motherhood issues in SMGL districts. About 3,800 community health care workers in Uganda and 1,558 in Zambia were engaged. HFAs indicated that facility deliveries rose significantly in SMGL districts. In Uganda, the proportion of births that took place in facilities rose from 45.5% to 66.8% (47% increase); similarly, in Zambia SMGL districts, facility deliveries increased from 62.6% to 90.2% (44% increase). In both countries, the proportion of women delivering in facilities equipped to provide emergency obstetric and newborn care also increased (from 28.2% to 41.0% in Uganda and from 26.0% to 29.1% in Zambia). The districts documented declines in the number of maternal deaths due to not accessing facility care during pregnancy, delivery, and the postpartum period in both countries. This reduction played a significant role in the decline of the maternal mortality ratio in SMGL-supported districts in Uganda but not in Zambia. Further work is needed to sustain gains and to eliminate preventable maternal and perinatal deaths.","316":"Maternal and perinatal mortality is a global development priority that continues to present major challenges in sub-Saharan Africa. Saving Mothers, Giving Life (SMGL) was a multipartner initiative implemented from 2012 to 2017 with the goal of improving maternal and perinatal health in high-mortality settings. The initiative accomplished this by reducing delays to timely and appropriate obstetric care through the introduction and support of community and facility evidence-based and district-wide health systems strengthening interventions. SMGL-designated pilot districts in Uganda and Zambia documented baseline and endline maternal and perinatal health outcomes using multiple approaches. These included health facility assessments, pregnancy outcome monitoring, enhanced maternal mortality detection in facilities, and district population-based identification and investigation of maternal deaths in communities. Over the course of the 5-year SMGL initiative, population-based estimates documented a 44% reduction in the SMGL-supported district-wide maternal mortality ratio (MMR) in Uganda (from 452 to 255 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births) and a 41% reduction in Zambia (from 480 to 284 maternal deaths per 100,000 live births). The MMR in SMGL-supported health facilities declined by 44% in Uganda and by 38% in Zambia. The institutional delivery rate increased by 47% in Uganda (from 45.5% to 66.8% of district births) and by 44% in Zambia (from 62.6% to 90.2% of district births). The number of facilities providing emergency obstetric and newborn care (EmONC) rose from 10 to 26 in Uganda and from 7 to 13 in Zambia, and lower- and mid-level facilities increased the number of EmONC signal functions performed. Cesarean delivery rates increased by more than 70% in both countries, reaching 9% and 5% of all births in Uganda and Zambia districts, respectively. Maternal deaths in facilities due to obstetric hemorrhage declined by 42% in Uganda and 65% in Zambia. Overall, perinatal mortality rates declined, largely due to reductions in stillbirths in both countries; however, no statistically significant changes were found in predischarge neonatal death rates in predischarge either country. MMRs fell significantly in Uganda and Zambia following the introduction of the SMGL interventions, and SMGL's comprehensive district systems-strengthening approach successfully improved coverage and quality of care for mothers and newborns.

","318":"","319":"Quality of family planning counseling is likely associated with whether or not women continue to use the same contraceptive method over time. The Method Information Index (MII) is a widely available measure of contraceptive counseling quality but little is known about its association with rates of method continuation. The index ranges from 0 to 3 based on a client's answer to whether she was told about other methods, potential side effects with her chosen method, and what to do if she experienced side effects. Using data from a prospective cohort study of 1,998 social franchise clients in Pakistan and Uganda, we investigated the relationship between reported baseline MII and the risk of method continuation over 12 months using survival analysis and Cox proportional hazard models. At baseline, about 65% of women in Pakistan and 73% of women in Uganda reported receiving information about all 3 MII aspects. In Pakistan, 59.4% of the 165 women who stopped using their modern method did so while still in need of contraception. In Uganda, of the 77 women who stopped modern method use, 64.9% discontinued while in need. Despite important differences in the demographics and method mix between the 2 countries, we found similar associations between baseline MII and discontinuation: in both countries as the MII score increased, the risk of discontinuation while in need decreased. In Pakistan, the risk of contraceptive discontinuation was 64% lower (crude hazard ratio [HRcrude]=0.36; P=.03), and 72% lower (HRcrude=0.28; P=.007), among women who were told about any 2, or any 3 aspects of MII, respectively. After adjusting for additional covariates, only the difference in the risk of contraceptive discontinuation between MII=3 and MII=0 remained statistically significant (HRadj=0.35; P=0.04). In Uganda, women who reported being informed about all aspects of MII were 80% less likely to discontinue while in need (HRadj=0.20; P&lt;.001), women informed about any 2 aspects of MII were 90% less likely (HRadj=0.10; P&lt;.001), and women who were informed about any 1 aspect of MII were 68% less likely (HRadj=0.32; P&lt;.02) to discontinue contraceptive use while in need as compared to women who reported not being informed about any aspect of MII. Baseline MII scores were positively associated with method continuation rates in our sample of clients from social franchises in both Pakistan and Uganda and could potentially be used as an indicator of contraceptive counseling quality.","320":"","321":"Resistance of malaria vectors to different classes of insecticides has been reported in malaria-endemic areas. Identifying new indoor residual spray (IRS) compounds that are effective against resistant vector populations is a high priority in managing insecticide resistance. A biological efficacy trial was conducted in the field from August 2016 to February 2017 to determine the efficacy of SumiShield 50WG, a new insecticide class, against wild Anopheles arabiensis. Indoor surfaces of 20 houses in Mabogini ward in the rural district of Moshi in northern Tanzania were sprayed with SumiShield 50WG. Bio-efficacy monitoring was conducted monthly for 6 months after the spray application. In addition, susceptibility tests were conducted by exposing mosquitoes to papers treated with permethrin 0.75%, pirimiphos-methyl 0.25%, and clothianidin 2% (SumiShield 50WG). Representatives from each household included in the study were surveyed about possible side effects or problems faced since the spray. Regression probit analysis was used to calculate knock-down times while the chi-square test was used to compare the mortality effect for mosquitoes. The SumiShield 50WG insecticide maintained optimal efficacy in the field setting for the duration of the 6-month study period, with 100% mortality of mosquitoes by 144 to 168 hours post-exposure to treated surfaces. Susceptibility tests showed some variation in tolerance to the tested insecticide-treated papers, particularly between SumiShield 50WG and pirimiphos-methyl. The knock-down times for 50% and 95% of the mosquitoes when exposed to SumiShield 50WG-treated test paper were 45.81 minutes and 83.85 minutes, respectively, and 67.77 minutes and 105.81 minutes, respectively, for the pirimiphos-methyl-treated papers. There were no short-term adverse side effects reported by households sprayed with SumiShield 50WG. The findings of this study suggest that SumiShield 50WG is a viable IRS insecticide for malaria vector control in Tanzania, especially in areas where pyrethroid resistance is a concern. ","322":"","323":"In Zambia, nurses and nurse-midwives lead more than half of rural facilities and guide primary health care delivery. Based on a formative assessment, the Ministry of Health (MOH) determined that improved leadership capacity and management skills of facility heads would help maximize the potential of Zambia's community-level investments. In support of these efforts, the Primary Health Care to Communities (PHC2C) initiative designed and tested a 12-month blended learning program for a certificate in leadership and management practice (CLMP) to build leadership and management competencies of rural facility heads, including increasing their ability to lead frontline teams and strengthening their skills and confidence in technology use. The CLMP was created with leadership from the MOH, technical guidance from the University of Zambia, and expertise from PHC2C partners IntraHealth International, Johnson &amp; Johnson, and mPowering Frontline Health Workers. In total, 20 nurse facility heads and 5 district nurse supervisors in 20 rural facilities across 5 districts were selected to test the course content and delivery approach. A mixed-methods approach, including evaluation of facility heads' presentations on community health improvement projects, focus group discussions with community members, and key informant interviews with nurses, clinical officers, and other stakeholders, was used to assess the results. Findings suggested that the facility heads had successfully strengthened their leadership and management competencies, increased their ability to lead frontline teams, and strengthened their skills and confidence in use of technology, including using a WhatsApp community of practice for support and consultation with other colleagues, with demonstrated improvements in the quality and accessibility of services. Based on assessment results and lessons from the test intervention, the Zambian government has committed to institutionalize CLMP as a national continuing professional development program, required for nurses posted to lead rural facilities. The planning, design, and implementation of this program offer an example to other countries and global actors of how nurses empowered with competence and confidence can play a significant role in coordinating the maze of community actors and navigating the complexities of community health systems to advance primary health care and universal health coverage.","324":"The success of the Namibian government's \"treatment for all\" approach to control and stop the country's HIV epidemic is dependent on an uninterrupted supply of antiretrovirals (ARVs) for people living with HIV. The public health system in Namibia, however, was constrained by an inefficient paper-based pharmaceutical information system resulting in unreliable and inaccessible data, contributing to persistent stock-outs of ARVs and other essential pharmaceuticals. This article describes the incremental implementation of an integrated pharmaceutical management information system to provide timely and reliable commodity and patient data for decision making in Namibia's national antiretroviral therapy (ART) program and the Ministry of Health and Social Services (MoHSS). The system has 4 interlinked information tools: (1) the Electronic Dispensing Tool (EDT) that manages the dispensing and inventory of antiretrovirals at service delivery points; (2) the EDT national database, which facilitates the flow, storage, and collation of ART data at the central level; (3) the Facility Electronic Stock Card used to manage pharmaceutical stocks and report inventory movement data to the national level; and (4) the Pharmaceutical Management Information Dashboard that integrates all 3 tools plus the warehouse management tool used by the central and regional medical stores into 1 dashboard that serves as a platform for the analysis and dissemination of pharmaceutical information throughout the health system. Implementing the pharmaceutical management information system was a prolonged and complicated process, with key challenges related to user acceptance and human resource constraints. The integrated pharmaceutical management information system enables Namibia to collect more than 90% of transactional commodity and patient dispensing data from more than 85% of all ART sites. Health managers use information from the system for medicine quantification decisions and to improve pharmaceutical service delivery. The MoHSS and its partners in the national ART program use the information for monitoring the World Health Organization early warning indicators for HIV drug resistance; ART defaulter tracing; and for planning, reporting, and research purposes. Namibia's pharmaceutical management information system demonstrates the feasibility and benefits of integrating related tools while maintaining their specialized functionality to address country-specific information and inventory management needs.","325":"Substandard delivery care has been widely documented as a major cause of maternal mortality in health facilities globally. Health worker learning via mobile devices is increasing rapidly; however, there is little evidence of mLearning effectiveness. This study sought to determine the feasibility, acceptability, and potential effect of the Safe Delivery App (SDA) on health workers' practices in basic emergency obstetric and newborn care (BEmONC) in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). The Theoretical Domains Framework was used to guide this research. Eight BEmONC facilities in central DRC were randomized to either an mLearning intervention or to standard practice (control). Maternal and newborn health workers in intervention facilities (n=64) were trained on the use of smartphones and the French version of the SDA. The SDA is an evidence-based BEmONC training resource with visual guidance using animated videos and clinical management instructions developed by the Maternity Foundation and the Universities of Copenhagen and Southern Denmark. Knowledge on postpartum hemorrhage (PPH) and neonatal resuscitation (NR) and self-confidence in performing 12 BEmONC procedures were assessed at baseline and at 3 months post-intervention. Eighteen qualitative interviews were conducted with app users and key stakeholders to assess feasibility and acceptability of mLearning and the use of the SDA. Maternal mortality was compared in intervention and control facilities using a smartphone-based Open Data Kit (ODK) data application. One smartphone with SDA and ODK was entrusted to intervention facilities for the study period, whereas control facilities received smartphones with ODK only. The analysis included 62 heath workers. Knowledge scores on postpartum hemorrhage and neonatal resuscitation increased significantly from baseline among intervention participants compared with controls at 3 months post-intervention (mean difference for PPH knowledge, 17.4 out of 100; 95% confidence interval [CI]=10.7 to 24.0 and 19.4 for NR knowledge; 95% CI=11.4 to 27.4), as did self-confidence scores on 12 essential BEmONC procedures (mean difference, 4.2 out of 48; CI=0.7 to 7.7). Increases were unaffected by health worker cadre and previous smartphone use. Qualitative interviews supported the feasibility and acceptability of the SDA and mLearning, and the potential for it to impact maternal and neonatal mortality in the DRC. Use of the Safe Delivery App supported increased health worker knowledge and self-confidence in the management of obstetric and newborn emergencies after 3 months. SDA and mLearning were found to be feasible and acceptable to health workers and key stakeholders in the DRC. ","326":"The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG IUS) is one of the most effective contraceptive methods, and it has noncontraceptive health benefits, including treatment for women with heavy menstrual bleeding. In 2016, Marie Stopes International Organisation Nigeria (MSION) expanded LNG IUS provision through training and support to 9 mobile outreach teams, 105 social franchise clinics, and 20 public-sector providers in 17 states. Information about the LNG IUS was added to awareness-raising materials, and community mobilizers provided information on the LNG IUS alongside other voluntary family planning methods. In 2016, Marie Stopes International, MSION, and FHI 360 examined clients' and providers' experiences with the LNG IUS to assess the potential for further scale-up of the method as part of a comprehensive approach to family planning in Nigeria. A mixed-methods approach was used including analysis of routine service data, supplemental data specific to LNG IUS clients, and in-depth interviews with LNG IUS clients, providers, and key opinion leaders. Just under 1,000 LNG IUS were inserted from September 2016 to December 2017 in 16 states in channels supported by MSION, representing 0.4% of all long-acting and reversible contraceptive (LARC) services provided by the participating providers during this time frame. The vast majority (82%) of LARCs provided were implants. A small pool of providers was responsible for providing almost half of the LNG IUS services. Common reasons for women choosing the LNG IUS were reduced menstrual bleeding (61%), long-acting duration (52%), effectiveness (49%), and discreetness (42%). Almost 80% of the users first heard about the method from a provider. Almost all users and providers reported positive experiences with the method, noting the noncontraceptive benefits and fewer side effects compared with other methods. All providers who were interviewed said they would continue offering the LNG IUS. Several key opinion leaders mentioned a total market approach incorporating both public and private sectors would be needed to successfully scale up the LNG IUS. Reduced menstrual bleeding and fewer side effects compared with other methods were identified as important attributes of the LNG IUS by clients, providers, and key opinion leaders. Challenges to uptake of the LNG IUS include difficulty with introducing a new method within a busy service delivery infrastructure and limited awareness and demand-generation activities on the LNG IUS specifically. A comprehensive product introduction approach with coordinated demand- and supply-side activities may be required for this method to reach its full potential. ","327":null,"328":"In a context where distance, user fees, and health staff shortages constitute significant barriers to accessing facility-based family planning services, the use of community-based distributors (CBDs) as counseling and contraceptive providers has been tested in several resource-constrained environments to increase family planning uptake. In the capital city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Kinshasa, a massive CBD program (AcQual) has been implemented since 2014, with lackluster results measured in terms of the low volume of contraceptives provided. A process evaluation conducted in 2017 assessed the fidelity of implementation of the program compared with the original AcQual design and analyzed gaps in provider training and motivation, contraceptive supplies, and reporting and monitoring processes. Its objective was to identify both theory and implementation failures in order to propose midcourse corrections for the program. The mixed-method data collection focused on the CBDs as a pivotal component of the AcQual program with 700 active CBDs interviewed. In addition, 10 in-depth interviews were conducted with clinical personnel, local health program managers, and project partners to identify gaps in the AcQual implementation environment. Issues with CBDs' performance, knowledge retention, and commitment to program activities, as well as gaps in contraceptive supply chains and insufficient monitoring and supervision processes, were the main implementation failures identified. Inappropriate method mix offered by the CBDs (condoms, pills, and CycleBeads only) and chronic overburdening of health care staff at the local level compounded these issues and explained the low volume of contraceptives provided through AcQual. Midcourse corrections included a more structured schedule of activities, stronger integration of CBDs with clinical providers and health zone managers, expansion of the mix of contraceptives offered to include subcutaneous injectables and emergency contraceptive pills, and clarifying reporting and monitoring responsibilities among all partners. Findings from this process evaluation contribute to the limited knowledge base regarding \"unwelcome results\" by examining all the intervention components and their relationships to highlight areas of potential failures, both in design and implementation, for similar CBD programs.","329":"","330":"","331":"","332":"","333":"Every year approximately 15 million babies are born prematurely and nearly 1 million die due to preterm birth complications. Evidence shows that antenatal corticosteroids (ACS) can be used to improve preterm birth outcomes in particular clinical settings. We conducted a policy and implementation landscape analysis of ACS use for women at risk of imminent preterm birth in 7 low-income countries. A study framework and situation analysis tool were developed based on the World Health Organization (WHO) recommendation for ACS use among women at risk of preterm birth. The study was conducted in the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Ethiopia, Malawi, Nigeria, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, and Uganda. Primary data were collected through key informant interviews. Secondary data were gathered from publicly available sources, a survey of health management information system indicators, and demographic data from the Every Preemie-SCALE country profiles for preterm and low birth weight prevention and care. All 7 countries are using ACS for women at risk of imminent preterm birth. The majority of countries include language on ACS use in clinical protocols or standard treatment guidelines; however, none include language on accurately measuring gestational age. For 2 of the 5 countries with national standards for ACS use, the upper gestational age limit for ACS use exceeded the WHO recommendation of 34 weeks. There are gaps in national guidance on how to determine if a woman is at risk of imminent preterm birth. Few countries include guidance that indicates ACS is contraindicated in the presence of infection. The majority of countries reported that facilities providing ACS meet comprehensive emergency obstetric and newborn care standards, and all countries reported the availability of some form of special newborn care or neonatal intensive care units at facilities providing ACS. Countries recognize challenges to access to high-quality maternal and newborn care that fulfill clinical care preconditions required for safe and effective ACS use. Key informants recommended support for clinical guidelines and provider training on ACS use, inclusion of obstetric indications for dexamethasone and betamethasone in national essential medicine lists, collecting and using ACS-related data, and improving the quality of maternal and newborn care, including specialized newborn care. ","334":"Universal health coverage reforms are complex and impact numerous processes, institutions, and individuals. To know whether reforms are being implemented as planned and working as envisioned, policy makers and managers need information and insights on bottlenecks. The United States Agency for International Development (USAID) provided support to build implementation research (IR) capacity and to conduct cycles of research to help Indonesia understand how its single-payer national insurance reform, Jaminan Kesehatan Nasional (JKN), was affecting primary care. Two cycles of IR in Indonesia focused on effects of JKN financing on primary care, as determined through a consultative process with stakeholders at national and district levels. This process generated questions relevant for implementers and policy makers and strengthened government interest in findings. Research was conducted in 5 diverse districts, and methods included key informant interviews, focus groups, document review, health worker surveys, and analysis of service delivery data. Cycle 1 findings showed an uneven understanding of JKN regulations, unequal implementation readiness, and limited evidence of improved productivity. JKN capitation payments did not increase health worker satisfaction or motivate additional effort. Informed by these findings, regulations were rewritten and the capitation payment formula was redesigned to include payment conditional on performance. Cycle 2 found that health workers experienced increased workloads because of increased enrollment in JKN and the requirement that people access primary care before being referred to higher levels of care. In addition, health workers indicated they did not experience the payment system to be fair. Instead of payment being conditional on performance, they indicated it was primarily determined by education and tenure, with only some districts incorporating a small payment component based on behaviors, such as attendance, and performance. The health workers said they preferred to be paid based on achieving primary care targets. Conducting IR so that questions are relevant and the process of finding and sharing answers is timely and cost-effective requires high-level skills, but support to build IR capacity has potential to make a lasting impact.","335":"","336":"Reproductive Health Uganda (RHU), a local NGO, introduced subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA-SC, brand name Sayana Press) in 4 districts of Uganda between April 2016 and March 2017. RHU trained public and private facility providers on all family planning methods including DMPA-SC; trained community health workers (known as village health teams, VHTs) to give family planning counseling, provide short-acting methods including DMPA-SC, and make referrals for long-acting and permanent methods; conducted mobile outreach and raised awareness of family planning; and provided family planning commodities. We used a retrospective cross-sectional evaluation design drawing on data from (1) in-depth interviews with 32 facility- and community-based providers; (2) key informant interviews with 7 policy makers and program staff; and (3) family planning program statistics from 4 RHU clinics, 26 mobile outreach sites, and 40 VHTs in 4 study districts. Data collection took place between April and June 2017. Over 12 months, 14,273 units of DMPA-SC were provided in RHU clinics, by mobile outreach teams, and by VHTs. DMPA-SC units were mostly administered in community settings either by VHTs (70%) or at mobile outreach events (26%). A substantial proportion (43%) of DMPA-SC units were administered to young people (&lt;25 years), a significantly higher proportion compared with other methods provided to this age group through the project (P&lt;.001), except condoms. In addition, a greater proportion of DMPA-SC units provided at the community level by VHTs were used by young people (45%) compared with units provided at outreach (36%) or in clinics (35%). Overall, injectables (DMPA-SC and intramuscular DMPA combined) came to represent 43% of all contraceptive methods provided, up from a baseline of 20%. This shift occurred despite significant increases in the volume of all other methods provided (P&lt;.001). Qualitative data revealed various factors that facilitated introduction, including comprehensive training, commodity availability, strong referral links, and early community engagement. RHU's experience supports the viability of community-based delivery of DMPA-SC and identifies opportunities to strengthen this approach. There is further evidence that DMPA-SC may be popular with young people, especially in community settings.","337":"Delivery of high-quality efficient health services is a cornerstone of the global agenda to achieve universal health coverage. According to the World Health Organization, health service delivery is considered good when equitable access to a comprehensive range of high-quality health services is ensured within an integrated and person-centered continuum of care. However, good health service delivery can be challenging in low-resource settings. In this review, we summarize and discuss key advances in health service delivery, particularly in the context of using digital health strategies for mitigating human resource constraints. The review updates the foundational systematic review conducted by Agarwal et al. in 2015. We used PubMed, EMBASE, and CINAHL to find relevant English-language peer-reviewed articles published 2018. Our search strategy for MEDLINE was based on MeSH (medical subject headings) terms and text words of key articles that we identified a priori. Our search identified 92 articles. After screening, we selected 24 articles for abstract review, of which only 6 met the eligibility criteria and were ultimately included in this review. Despite encouraging advances in the evidence base on digital strategies for health service delivery, the current body of evidence is still quite limited in 3 main areas: the effectiveness of interventions on health outcomes, improvement in health system efficiencies for service delivery, and the human capacity required to implement and support digital health strategies at scale. Two particular areas, digital health-enhanced referral coordination and mobile clinical decision support systems, demonstrate considerable potential to improve the quality and comprehensiveness of care received by patients, but they require a greater level of standardization and an expanded scope of health worker engagement across the health system in order to scale them up effectively. Additional research is urgently needed to inform the effectiveness of interventions on health outcomes, improvement in health system efficiencies, and cost-effectiveness of service delivery. In particular, more documentation and research on ways to standardize and engage health workers in digital referral and clinical decision support systems can provide the foundation needed to scale these promising approaches in low- and middle-income settings. ","338":"The recent introduction of digital health into generating demand for health commodities and services has provided practitioners with an expanded universe of potential tools to strengthen demand and ensure service delivery receipt. However, considerable gaps remain in our understanding of which interventions are effective, which characteristics mediate their benefit for different target populations and health domains, and what is necessary to ensure effective deployment. This paper first provides an overview of the types of digital health interventions for demand generation, including untargeted client communication, client-to-client communication, on-demand information services, personal health tracking, client financial transactions, and targeted client communication. It then provides a general overview of 118 studies published between January 1, 2010, and October 3, 2017, that used digital interventions to generate demand for health interventions. The majority (61%) of these studies used targeted client communication to provide health education or reminders to improve treatment adherence, and the most frequently (27%) studied health condition was HIV\/AIDS. Intervention characteristics that have been found to have some effect on gains in demand generation include modality, directionality, tailoring, phrasing, and schedule. The paper also explores new emergent digital approaches that expand the potential effect of traditional demand generation in terms of personalization of content and services, continuity of care, and accountability tracking. Applying existing frameworks for monitoring and evaluation and reporting, research on emerging approaches will need to consider not only their feasibility but also their effectiveness in achieving demand generation outcomes. We propose a research agenda to help guide the field of digital demand generation studies and programs within a broader health systems strengthening agenda, including establishing and documenting the influence of intervention characteristics within different populations and health domains and examining the long-term effects and cost-effectiveness of digital demand generation interventions, as well as equity in access to such interventions.","339":"The collection of journal articles, systematic reviews, and reports published over the last decade that attest to the potential of digital technologies to achieve health workforce improvements across all aspects of the health system is vast. As a capacity-building mechanism, digital technology has potential for low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to support development of the health workforce, including those health workers based in remote or rural areas, to train, motivate, support, monitor, and pay them. The purpose of this scoping review to present, at a high level, the state of the evidence and best practices in digital strategies for human resources for health and to propose a roadmap for a research agenda to fill identified gaps in the evidence. A variety of peer-reviewed and gray literature sources were searched using selected key terms related to digital health and health workforce, limited to materials published from 2010 to 2018. More than 70 articles, reports, and blog posts were reviewed, with in-depth analysis of 29 articles. Findings show that a range of digital health solutions for health workforce development have been tested and used, such as for health worker training, provider-to-provider communication and professional networking, and supervision of and performance feedback to health workers. There is some evidence of improved efficiency and effectiveness, at least at the level of pilots or small-scale projects. There is, however, a growing urgency in global health to move beyond small-scale demonstration projects and to define the capital and recurring costs of implementation and scale up of digital health interventions, including the return on investment. The next frontier is to select, adapt, and implement at scale those digital health interventions for health worker development and management found to be most promising.","340":"Countries finance health care using a combination of 3 main functions: raising resources for health, pooling resources, and purchasing health services. In this paper, we examine how digital health technologies can be used to enhance these health financing functions in low- and middle-income countries and can thus contribute to progress toward universal health coverage. We illustrate our points by presenting some recent innovations in digital technologies for financing health care, identifying their contributions and their limits. Some examples include a mobile-health wallet application used in Kenya that encourages households to put money aside for future health expenses; an online software platform developed by a startup in Tanzania in partnership with a private insurance provider to give individuals and families the opportunity to choose among different health coverage options; and digital maps by a number of startups that bring together data on health facility locations and capacity, including equipment, staff, and types of services offered. We also sketch an agenda for future research and action for digital strategies for health financing. The development and adoption of effective solutions that align well with the universal health coverage agenda will require strong partnerships between stakeholders and enough proactive stewardship by authorities.","341":"Digital innovations have evolved over the last 15 years to support health activities, and their introduction in low- and middle-income countries has shown the potential to catalyze gains in health systems and service delivery. Despite widespread efforts to roll out these technologies, standardized approaches for formalizing national stewardship responsibilities and ensuring that digital health is a routine, mature, sustainable, and country-owned component of the health system are lacking. In this paper, we define digital health stewardship, with a focus on the ministry of health's role; describe practices undertaken to date; and identify gaps where increased attention could improve sustainability, impact, and local ownership. We conducted a purposeful review of peer-reviewed and gray literature. Of the 404 identified resources from the peer-reviewed literature, 12 met all of the inclusion criteria. After searching various online gray literature repositories, we identified 6 sources based on their quality, source, and relevance. Selected resources were abstracted for relevance to our stewardship themes and synthesized. Findings are presented in 4 broad thematic areas: strategic direction, policies and procedures, roles and responsibilities, and health service delivery implications. Evidence related to strategic direction offers guidance on the main responsibilities under digital health stewardship, including regulations and incentives to promote compliance with standards, mechanisms for oversight, and structures to support evidence-based decisions, and the potential institutional structures and goals that could be used to achieve them. A number of examples of high-level policies and implementation-oriented procedures, such as from the European Commission and the World Health Organization, demonstrate how to operationalize the strategic direction. Available evidence for the remaining themes was sparse, drawing attention to key areas for future work. Despite the importance of country-owned stewardship of digital health, the guidance available is limited and aspirational. Concrete recommendations, including how to adapt existing innovations to the local context, are needed. In particular, the role of external partners needs to be oriented toward building and supporting country capacity to achieve digital health stewardship's potential to support health systems into the future.

With the rapid increase in DR-TB notifications through GeneXpert technology, it was imperative to come up with a new treatment strategy that could keep up with the increase of patients diagnosed. Intervention was designed to support national transition of DR-TB management of World Health Organization-approved long course (20-to-24-month regimen) treatment from a hospital-based approach to the decentralized model of community-based programmatic management of DR-TB (cPMDT). In close coordination with the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare and National TB Program, patients were initiated into treatment at hospitals and then transferred to community-based care. A cadre of directly observed therapy providers supported treatment at the household level, supervised by the outpatient DR-TB teams. We conducted a descriptive pre- and post-intervention study of all 1,946 DR-TB patients enrolled in treatment nationwide between May 2012 and June 2015. Data were collected from hospitals, patient cards, district records, and diagnostic laboratories through the National TB Program. Intervention results were assessed in comparison with the baseline (2011) indicators. During the intervention period, treatment enrollment of 1,946 diagnosed DR-TB patients through the national program increased from 50% in 2011 to 100% in 2015. The delay between diagnosis and treatment initiation decreased from 69 days in 2011 to 6 days in 2014. Most (95%) of the patients completed all scheduled follow-up smear and culture tests. By the sixth month of treatment, 99% of patients had negative smear conversion and 98% had negative culture conversion. The treatment success rate increased from 70% in 2011 to 76% in 2015 at the end of the intervention period. The results also indicate a decline between baseline and end line from 14% to 9% for patients died, 14% to 10% for loss to follow-up, and 1.7% to 0% for treatment failure. Community-based management is an effective approach for increasing access to quality-assured DR-TB treatment.

Data from the study will help inform policy changes needed to support the introduction of evidence-based childbirth and early newborn care practices effectively and to inform further scale up of EENC nationwide. Ten randomly selected hospitals in 4 early-introducing provinces participated in the study. We collected data from 20 simulated delivery scenario observations and focus group discussions and individual interviews with 10 hospital management staff. Policies, protocols, and guidelines related to childbirth and newborn care practice were also collected and reviewed at each hospital. Additionally, a survey was emailed to 15 childbirth and newborn experts from the 4 selected provinces and completed by 13. Data were compared with WHO EENC evidence-based standards to calculate the agreement rates. Barriers to introducing evidence-based guidelines were identified in focus groups and key informant interviews, then combined into common categories. Hospital policies were not consistent with WHO recommendations in 10 (59%) of the 17 delivery and early newborn care practices. Delayed cord clamping was recommended by 30% of hospital protocols and prolonged skin-to-skin contact by 13%, neither of which were observed in the delivery simulations. Kangaroo mother care (KMC) for stable preterm babies was required in only 17% of the hospitals; no preterm babies had KMC initiated, with all immediately separated from their mothers and admitted to neonatal intensive care units. Newborn resuscitation equipment was required to be placed within 2 meters of the delivery bed in 84% of hospital protocols, but was prepared in only 40% of cases. Immediate drying after birth was required in 48% of hospital protocols, but was initiated in only 20% of observed cases. Current childbirth and early newborn care policy and practice in China is not aligned with WHO recommendations for some major interventions. To make it easier and safer for hospital workers to practice EENC, expert working groups and national policies must be established to address inconsistencies and cultural beliefs and provide a strong, evidence-based set of guidelines for hospitals and health workers to follow.

The 2015 Neonatal Resuscitation Consensus on Science and Treatment Recommendations by the International Liaison Committee on Resuscitation informed scientific updates, which were harmonized with the 2012 World Health Organization Basic Newborn Resuscitation Guidelines. Published literature and program reports, consensus guidelines on reprocessing equipment, systematic collection of suggestions from frontline users, and responses to a semistructured online questionnaire informed educational\/implementation revisions. Links to maternal care were added. Draft materials underwent Delphi review and field testing in India and Sierra Leone. An Utstein-style meeting of stakeholders identified key actions for successful implementation. Scientific revisions included expectant management of infants with meconium-stained amniotic fluid, limitation of suctioning, and initiating and continuing effective ventilation until spontaneous respirations. Frontline users (N=102) suggested augmented simulation methods to build confidence and competence and additional guidance for facilitators on implementation. Users identified a need for sufficient practice during the workshop, systematized ongoing practice, and enough simulators for participants. Field trials refined approaches to self-reflection, feedback and debriefing, and quality improvement. Utstein meeting stakeholders validated the importance of quality improvement and use of data to improve outcomes. The second edition of HBB provides a newer paradigm of learning for providers that incorporates workshop practice, self-reflection, and feedback and debriefing to reinforce learning as well as the promotion of mentorship and development of facilitators, systems for low-dose high-frequency practice in facilities, and quality improvement related to neonatal resuscitation. ","358":"Global health education in tertiary institutions worldwide is at an all-time high. Until recently, most evaluations of student learning from a global exposure was in the form of a reflective paper with little information that would enable standardized assessment of the competencies gained. In 2015, the Consortium of Universities for Global Health (CUGH) published a set of interprofessional global health competencies that were drawn upon to create a Global Health Competency Self-Confidence Scale and workbook. This study reports the development and validation of the scale and its implications for global health education. In total, 126 graduate students from a university in New York State participated in the validation process of the Global Health Competency Self-Confidence Scale-an 11-domain, 22-item competency self-assessment to measure the level of confidence of students before and after undertaking a global learning experience. The team used factor analysis to compare the scale to the Global Health Competency Survey for content validity and reliability. Reliability and validity of the scale was determined. An exploratory factor analysis identified 4 standalone components as: (1) Ethical and Professional Practice, (2) Capacity Strengthening and Planning, (3) Structural and Social Determinants of Health, and (4) Strategic Analysis. The scale showed excellent internal consistency (Cronbach's alpha=0.92) and test-retest reliability (reliability (r)=0.455; P&lt;.001). Concurrent validity was established. The Global Health Competency Self-Confidence Scale contributes to a further consolidation and refinement of competency groupings into components of global health education and offers a scale to assess student learning in global placements. ","359":"Despite the many supply- and demand-side interventions aimed at increasing contraceptive uptake, the modern contraceptive prevalence rate in Nigeria has remained very low (9.8%). Religion is an important part of the sociocultural fabric of many communities. As such, religious leaders have the power to inhibit or facilitate effective adoption of contraceptive methods to support family health. We assess the association of exposure to religious leaders' tailored scriptural family planning messages with contraceptive use in Nigeria. This cross-sectional study used data from a Measurement, Learning and Evaluation Project survey conducted in 2015 in 4 Nigerian states-Federal Capital Territory, Kaduna, Kwara, and Oyo. The final study sample was restricted to 9,725 non-pregnant women aged 15 to 49 years. Data analysis included descriptive statistics and binary logistic regression analysis to explore significant relationships between current use of a modern contraceptive method, exposure to family planning messages from religious leaders, and selected background characteristics. About 2 in 5 women reported being exposed to family planning messages from religious leaders in the past year. Bivariate results revealed a higher uptake of modern contraceptives among women with high exposure to different NURHI interventions (35.5%) compared with respondents in the low or medium exposure categories (14.5% and 24.5%, respectively). The multivariable analysis revealed significantly higher contraceptive uptake among women who had exposure to family planning messages from religious leaders relative to those with no exposure (odds ratio=1.70; 95% confidence interval, 1.54 to 1.87; P&lt;.001). This association remained significant after adjustment for background characteristics and other selected variables. Interventions that engage clerics of different faiths as change agents for shaping norms and informing behaviors about family planning and contraceptive use are crucial for increasing contraceptive uptake in Nigeria. ","360":"Most women worldwide do not desire another pregnancy within a year after giving birth, but uptake of modern contraception during this time period is low. We independently tested 2 approaches to increasing contraceptive uptake and the 2 approaches combined using a quasi-experimental study design in Kinshasa, the Democratic Republic of the Congo. The primary analytic data came from client exit interviews conducted post-intervention (N=563) from 4 study groups. The first arm (n=150) received free family planning, and the second arm (n=113) a quality inputs intervention involving systematic screening, referral, and immediate provision of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) after labor and delivery. The third arm (n=150) received a combination of the 2 interventions, and the fourth (n=150) no intervention. Family planning service statistics were also collected throughout the intervention period. Women in the quality arm (odds ratio [OR]=4.5; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.8 to 10.9) and free\/quality arm (OR=6.7; 95% CI, 2.8 to 16.1) were more likely to be properly screened for family planning than women in the control group, but paper referral was seldom implemented in any group. Women in the free arm (OR=3.8; 95% CI, 1.6 to 9.0) and in the free\/quality arm (OR=11.0; 95% CI, 4.3 to 27.9) were more likely than the control group to report being properly counseled on family planning. Clients were more likely to be modern contraceptive users (excluding condoms) in the free arm (OR=3.2; 95% CI, 1.4 to 7.2) and in the free\/quality arm (OR=8.6; 95% CI, 3.9 to 19.0) than in the control group. Clients in all study arms were more likely to use a LARC compared with the control group (Quality arm: OR=2.9; 95% CI, 1.1 to 7.9. Free arm: OR=5.6; 95% CI, 2.3 to 13.7. Free\/quality arm: OR=8.4; 95% CI, 3.4 to 20.6). Service statistics from the combined intervention arm showed that a significantly greater proportion of family planning adoption occurred within the immediate postpartum period (0 to 2 days) in the quality arm (P&lt;.001) and free\/quality arm (P&lt;.001) than in the control arm. Quality inputs, free contraceptives, and the combined intervention had positive impacts on aspects of screening and contraceptive uptake. The combined intervention performed best by all measures. Providing family planning, including LARCs, in the immediate postpartum period, implementing a systematic screening and referral system, and providing free methods may improve family planning access and uptake in the extended perinatal period in this environment. ","361":null,"362":"","363":"","364":"Mali has one of the highest maternal mortality ratios in the world coupled with one of the lowest modern contraceptive use rates. Nearly a quarter of the country's 750,000 annual births occur within 24 months of a previous birth, increasing the risks for mothers and babies. Nearly 70% of postpartum women have an unmet need for family planning. In 2016, Population Services International Mali (PSI-Mali) introduced a dedicated postpartum intrauterine device (PPIUD) inserter to replace the technique of using forceps for PPIUD insertion, with the aim of helping to address this substantial family planning gap. A mixed-methods approach was used to assess program results and the experiences of PSI-trained providers using the dedicated PPIUD inserter in 5 health facilities in Bamako. We conducted 10 key informant interviews with providers and 4 key informant interviews with operational and clinical staff involved in training and supporting providers. Further data were collected from district health surveys and facility registers. Secondary data encompassed documentation from 2011 through 2017, with the service delivery figures of PPIUD using the dedicated inserter focused on the pilot period of March 2016 through December 2017. Primary data were collected in Mali in July 2017. Between March 2016 and December 2017, PSI-Mali trained 134 providers on the dedicated PPIUD inserter and provided more than 3,500 voluntary PPIUDs. Of the 1,840 voluntary PPIUDs provided in 2017 alone, 67% were provided by facilities trained to use the dedicated PPIUD inserter. Providers stated a preference for the inserter (compared with the use of forceps) due to its ease, speed, and perceived lower associated risks of infection. Service data from the 5 facilities visited showed an overall average PPIUD uptake of 7.3% of deliveries in 2017. Although private facilities had considerably fewer deliveries than public facilities (600-900 compared with 20-30, respectively), a much higher proportion of women delivering in the private facilities chose a PPIUD. The acceptance of the dedicated PPIUD inserter by providers may help reduce some of the supply-side barriers that inhibit women's access to postpartum family planning methods. With continued support to providers, coupled with ongoing efforts to address differences in service trends between sectors and demand-side barriers to the PPIUD and family planning more broadly, the dedicated PPIUD inserter could play an important role in responding to the high unmet need among postpartum women in Mali. ","365":"Access to family planning services and appropriate contraceptive methods is crucial for ensuring good health outcomes for women and adolescent girls. The World Health Organization worked with the U.S. Agency for International Development to develop the Service Availability and Readiness Assessment (SARA) survey to measure health facility capacity to provide end users with appropriate, high-quality health care. In this study, we looked at the service availability and readiness of health facilities to provide contraception in 10 African countries: Benin, Burkina Faso, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Mauritania, Niger, Sierra Leone, Tanzania, Togo, and Uganda. This study compared SARA survey data on family planning services from each of the 10 countries. We conducted a descriptive analysis of variations in facility readiness and the availability of services, contraceptive methods, trained staff, family planning guidelines, and basic health care equipment. Overall, many of the countries surveyed had a relatively high availability of at least 1 contraceptive method. Rural facilities tended to have more availability of contraception than urban facilities, and government facilities tended to have higher availability of family planning than other providers. The countries differed in their particular dominant contraceptive method, and stock-outs of contraceptive methods were observed. Countries had overall low levels of all 6 tracer items (availability of family planning guidelines, staff trained in family planning, blood pressure apparatuses, combined oral contraceptive, injectable contraceptives, and male condoms on the day of the assessment), indicating low health system readiness. There were discrepancies between reported and observed availability of blood pressure apparatuses and family planning guides and having at least 1 staff member trained to use these tools. In all countries, unmarried adolescents appeared to have less access to family planning than the general population. Stock-outs and logistics management problems were common among the countries surveyed. Critical gaps between reported and actual availability of products and services often makes it difficult for end users to access appropriate family planning methods. To address many of the issues, additional health worker training is needed and more effort to target and support adolescents should be undertaken. To achieve universal health coverage targets for family planning, gaps in the availability and readiness of health systems to provide contraceptive products and services must be reduced. ","366":"A stubborn persistence of child severe acute malnutrition (SAM) and continued gaps in program coverage have made identifying methods for expanding detection, diagnosis, and treatment of SAM an urgent public health need. There is growing consensus that making mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) use more widely accessible among caregivers and community health workers (CHWs) is an important next step in further decentralizing SAM care and increasing program coverage, including the ability of CHWs to treat uncomplicated SAM in community settings. We conducted a systematic review to summarize published and operational evidence published since 2000 describing the use of MUAC for detection and diagnosis of SAM in children aged 6-59 months by caregivers and CHWs, and of management of uncomplicated SAM by CHWs, all outside of formal health care settings. We screened 1,072 records, selected 43 records for full-text screening, and identified 22 studies that met our eligibility criteria. We extracted data on a number of items, including study design, strengths, and weaknesses; intervention and control; and key findings and operational lessons. We then synthesized the qualitative findings to inform our conclusions. The issue of treating children classified as SAM based on low weight-for-height, rather than MUAC, at household level, is not addressed in this review. We found evidence that caregivers are able to use MUAC to detect SAM in their children with minimal risk and many potential benefits to early case detection and coverage. We also found evidence that CHWs are able to correctly use MUAC for SAM detection and diagnosis and to provide a high quality of care in the treatment of uncomplicated SAM when training, supervision, and motivation are adequate. However, the number of published research studies was small, their geographic scope was narrow, and most described intensive, small-scale interventions; thus, findings are not currently generalizable to public-sector health care systems. Scaling up the use of MUAC by caregivers and CHWs to detect SAM in household and community settings is a promising step toward improving the coverage of SAM detection, diagnosis, and treatment. Further research on scalability, applicability across a wider range of contexts, coverage impact, and cost is needed. The primary use of MUAC for SAM detection should also be explored where appropriate. ","367":"Tanzania and Uganda have high total fertility and maternal mortality rates, and low contraceptive prevalence rates. High-quality preservice family planning education for nurses and midwives can improve the quality of sexual and reproductive health care, thereby improving health outcomes. In 2015, we worked with relevant stakeholders in Tanzania and Uganda through a series of surveys, assessments, and workshops to adapt modules of the Training Resource Package for Family Planning (TRP), an evidence-based global resource, to improve the quality of preservice family planning education for nurses and midwives. With support, a wide range of stakeholders, including policy makers, program managers, educators from nursing and midwifery training institutions, and representatives from professional associations, identified relevant TRP modules and adapted them to each country's context to inform and develop their own lesson plans in accordance with national policies, guidelines, and standardized preservice education templates. Important lessons from the adaptation process include the following: (1) engage relevant ministries of health and education, professional associations, and regulatory councils at each step of the process to increase the acceptability and utility of the TRP; (2) use a context-specific process for adaptation of the TRP, as not one process will fit the needs of all countries; and (3) include nursing and midwifery educators in the adaptation process to create an established pool of trainers who can then cascade the TRP to other educators in their respective schools. Overall, participants in both countries expressed challenges with incorporating competency-based teaching methods into their curricula because they were unfamiliar with such approaches themselves and with reducing the extensive TRP content to fit within the time constraints for preservice education. Adaptation of an evidence-based global family planning training resource in Tanzania and Uganda resulted in substantive changes to the curricula of the reproductive health preservice course unit that will support nurses and midwives to provide quality, rights-based family planning services. ","368":null,"369":"Tubal occlusion by minilaparotomy is a safe, highly effective, and permanent way to limit childbearing. We aimed to establish whether the safety of the procedure provided by trained clinical officers (COs) was not inferior to the safety when provided by trained assistant medical officers (AMOs), as measured by major adverse event (AE) rates. In this randomized, controlled, open-label noninferiority trial, we enrolled participants at 7 health facilities in Arusha region, Tanzania, as well as during outreach activities conducted in Arusha and neighboring regions. Consenting, eligible participants were randomly allocated by a research assistant at each site to minilaparotomy performed by a trained CO or by a trained AMO, in a 1:1 ratio. We asked participants to return at 3, 7, and 42 days postsurgery. The primary outcome was the rate of major AEs following minilaparotomy performed by COs versus AMOs, during the procedure and through 42 days follow-up. The noninferiority margin was 2%. The trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, Identifier NCT02944149. We randomly allocated 1,970 participants between December 2016 and June 2017, 984 to the CO group and 986 to the AMO group. Most (87%) minilaparotomies were conducted during outreach services. In the intent-to-treat analysis, 0 of 978 participants had a major AE in the CO group compared with 1 (0.1%) of 984 in the AMO group (risk difference: -0.1% [95% confidence interval: -0.3% to 0.1%]), meeting the criteria for noninferiority. We saw no evidence of differences in measures of procedure performance, participant satisfaction, or provider self-efficacy between the groups. Tubal occlusion by minilaparotomy performed by trained COs is safe, effective, and acceptable to women, and the procedure can be safely and effectively provided in outreach settings. Our results provide evidence to support policy change in resource-limited settings to allow task shifting of minilaparotomy to properly trained and supported COs, increasing access to female sterilization and helping to meet the rising demand for the procedure among women wanting to avoid pregnancy. They also suggest high demand for these services in Tanzania, given the large number of women recruited in a relatively short time period. ","370":"","371":"The Net Promoter Score (NPS) metric, commonly used by Fortune 500 companies to measure the customer experience, is calculated using a 0-to-10 scale to answer 1 question: \"How likely is it that you would recommend [company X] to a friend or colleague?\" Despite the value of this methodology as a predictor of growth and indicator of customer satisfaction in for-profit industries, uptake of the NPS has been slower in the social sector due to concerns about its applicability and acceptability in noncommercial settings, particularly among low-literacy populations. To address these concerns, we conducted a series of small-scale pilots in El Salvador, India, Kenya, and Nigeria to test different implementation approaches of the NPS in sexual and reproductive health clinics-including face-to-face interviews, a guided drop box, integration of the NPS question into an existing client exit interview, and self-administered and volunteer-assisted online surveys using tablets in clinics-and compared the traditional 0-to-10 number scale with an emoji-face scale. Findings showed that the NPS can be effectively adapted for use in low-resource health clinics among low-literacy clients using the number scale. There was no statistically significant difference in mean likeliness to recommend services when using the emoji versus numerical scales in India; however, there was a statistically significant difference when using the guided drop box approach versus face-to-face interviews. When combined with demographic and service-use questions, the NPS generated useful insights on client groups that were more or less likely to recommend the services. While providing an online survey on tablets can be an efficient methodology for implementing the NPS, self-administered approaches may be limited by a client's level of literacy or comfort with technology. For those client populations with a lower NPS, we advise using a qualitative feedback process that can elicit critical feedback to identify actions to improve their experience. Our experience with testing and implementing the NPS in SRH clinics in diverse settings suggests it is a promising approach to gaining insight into the client experience in nonprofit health care settings.","372":"Equality is a central component of the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs). We took one SDG indicator and benchmark-percent of family planning demand met with modern contraceptives, with a benchmark of at least 75% in all countries-as a case study to illuminate recommendations for monitoring equality. Specifically, we assessed levels, patterns, and trends in disparity by key background characteristics and identified disparity measures that are programmatically relevant and easy to interpret. Data were from the Demographic and Health Surveys in 55 countries that have conducted at least 2 surveys since 1990. We calculated absolute difference among subgroups, disaggregated by age, education, household wealth quintile, urban\/rural residence, subnational region\/administrative unit, and marital status. Our unit of analysis was survey, and we conducted largely descriptive analyses. To understand trends in disparity, we used a fixed-effect linear regression model to estimate an annual rate of change in absolute differences. A significant level of disparity existed across various background characteristics, ranging from a median difference of 5 percentage points by marital status to 32 percentage points by administrative unit. On average across the study countries, national level of met demand has increased over time while disparity has declined in most disaggregates including by education, wealth, residence, and age. We found statistically significant positive correlations among 4 disparity measures-education, wealth, residence, and administrative unit. Disparities by wealth quintile were easiest to interpret over time and across countries. At the global level, we recommend monitoring disparity in met demand by wealth quintile, which is strongly correlated with disparity by education, residence, and region and comparable across countries and over time. For monitoring by individual countries and for programmatic purposes, we further recommend monitoring disparity by first-level administrative unit, which can provide direct programmatic relevance. ","373":"Pregnancy among women of advanced maternal age (those 35 years or older) or among women of high parity (those having had 5 or more births) is linked to maternal and infant mortality. Yet little is known about the drivers of these pregnancies as they are often neglected in existing family planning and reproductive health programs. To better understand the context in which advanced maternal age and high parity pregnancies occur and the acceptability of discussing associated pregnancy risks, the Health Communication Capacity Collaborative (HC3) conducted formative qualitative research between January and March 2015 on the perception and determinants of such pregnancies in rural and urban areas of Niger and Togo. We supplemented this research with secondary analyses of data from Demographic and Health Surveys and a 2014 Niger survey. Our formative research showed that urban Togolese participants demonstrated more knowledge about advanced maternal age and high parity pregnancy risks than did participants in Niger as a whole. We found that such pregnancies were generally seen as part of reproductive norms in situations where fertility rates remain exceptionally high, especially in Niger. Social, gender, and religious norms, including competition between co-wives, also drove women into high parity and advanced maternal age situations, particularly in Niger, highlighting the need to bring men and community and religious leaders into family planning conversations to increase acceptance. The study also provided important insights needed to address these high-risk pregnancies through culturally appropriate health communication interventions. A main insight was that providers often had incomplete information about advanced maternal age and high parity pregnancies and lacked communication skills, protocols, and tools to appropriately discuss such pregnancy risks with clients. HC3 used these and additional findings to create an Implementation Kit (I-Kit) for family planning and maternal and child health program managers with guidance and tangible tools to address advanced maternal age and high parity pregnancy through social and behavior change communication. The I-Kit includes health communication materials to engage women, men, decision makers, communities, health care providers, journalists, and others. In 2016 and 2017, one organization each in Niger and Togo piloted the I-Kit, integrated selected I-Kit tools into their unique programs, and documented their experiences. Both organizations credited the I-Kit with expanding the scope of their programs to now address advanced maternal age and high parity pregnancy and provided concrete suggestions for adapting the materials according to activity and intended audience.","374":"Analyze the content of documents used to guide mandatory fortification programs for cereal grains. Legislation, standards, and monitoring documents, which are used to mandate, provide specifications for, and confirm fortification, respectively, were collected from countries with mandatory wheat flour (n=80), maize flour (n=11), and\/or rice (n=6) fortification as of January 31, 2015, yielding 97 possible country-grain combinations (e.g., Philippines-wheat flour, Philippines-rice) for the analysis. After excluding countries with limited or no documentation, 72 reviews were completed, representing 84 country-grain combinations. Based on best practices, a criteria checklist was created with 44 items that should be included in fortification documents. Two reviewers independently scored each available document set for a given country and food vehicle (a country-grain combination) using the checklist, and then reached consensus on the scoring. We calculated the percentage of country-grain combinations containing each checklist item and examined differences in scores by grain, region, and income level. Of the 72 country-grain combinations, the majority of documentation came from countries in the Americas (46%) and Africa (32%), and most were from upper and lower middle-income countries (73%). The majority of country-grain combinations had documentation stating the food vehicle(s) to be fortified (97%) and the micronutrients (e.g., iron) (100%), fortificants (e.g., ferrous fumarate) (88%), and fortification levels required (96%). Most (78%) stated that labeling is required to indicate a product is fortified. Many country-grain combinations described systems for external (64%) monitoring, and stated that industry is required to follow quality assurance\/quality control (64%), though detailed protocols (33%) and roles and responsibilities (45%) were frequently not described. Most country-grain combinations have systems in place for internal, external, and import monitoring. However, documentation of other important items that would influence product compliance to national standard, such as roles and responsibilities between agencies, the cost of regulating fortification, and enforcement strategies, are often lacking. Countries with existing mandatory fortification can improve upon these items in revisions to their documentation while countries that are beginning fortification can use the checklist to assist in developing new policies and programs. ","375":"The Millennium Villages Project facilitated technology-based health interventions in rural under-resourced areas of sub-Saharan Africa. Our study examined whether data entry using SMS compared with paper forms by community health workers (CHWs) led to higher proportion of timely follow-up visits for malnutrition screening in under-5 children in Ghana, Rwanda, Senegal, and Uganda. Children under 5 years were screened for malnutrition every 90 days by CHWs using mid-upper arm circumference (MUAC) readings. CHWs used either SMS texts or paper forms to enter MUAC data. Reminder texts were sent at 15 days before follow-up was needed. Chi-square tests assessed proportion of timely follow-up visits within 90 days between SMS and paper groups. Logistic regression analysis was conducted in a step-wise multivariate model. Post-hoc power calculations were conducted to verify strength of associations. SMS data entry was associated with a higher proportion of timely malnutrition follow-up visits compared with paper forms across all sites. The association was strongest with consistent SMS use over consecutive visits. SMS use at the first of 2 consecutive visits was most effective, highlighting the importance of SMS reminder alerts. SMS technology with reminders increased timely CHW malnutrition screening visits for under-5 children in Ghana, Rwanda, Senegal, and Uganda, highlighting the importance of such technology for improving health worker behavior in low-resource settings. ","376":"Evidence on effective behavior change programming for sexual and reproductive health among married youth aged 15-24 in developing countries is lacking. To address this gap, we examined monitoring, evaluation, and special study data from the Promoting Change in Reproductive Behavior of Adolescents (PRACHAR) Project, which was implemented between 2001 and 2012 in Bihar, India, over 3 phases using 2 different implementation models (NGO- and government-led). We conducted a synthesis of evidence from multiple PRACHAR studies to identify key findings on intervention effectiveness, scalability, and sustained effects on behaviors. Data were triangulated from quantitative population-based quasi-experimental evaluations from each project phase; the project's performance monitoring database; and qualitative studies with beneficiaries. PRACHAR's original comprehensive NGO-led model, which included behavior change elements and multiple overlapping communication channels (including home visits and small-group meetings), increased contraceptive use among young married couples, and these outcomes were sustained 4-8 years after project interventions ended. Several program elements were critical to the effectiveness of PRACHAR, including use of a socioecological intervention model with emphasis on behavior change efforts; use of a gender-synchronized approach that engages both male and female partners; and intensity of interventions calibrated to different moments in the life cycle of adolescents and youth. While the hybrid government-NGO model of PRACHAR implementation reached greater scale than the original NGO-led model, comparison of results suggests trade-offs in effectiveness of interventions and sustained impacts. A decade of learning from the PRACHAR Project in Bihar, India, finds that comprehensive programming with gender-synchronized interventions tailored to specific life stages and aimed at different levels of the socioecological model can effectively increase contraceptive use among married young people in a conservative context. Shifting from a more intensive NGO-led model to less intensive government implementation enhances scalability but may have diminished impact on reach and long-lasting effectiveness. ","377":"Cervical cancer accounts for 23% of cancer incidence and 22% of cancer mortality among women in Burkina Faso. These proportions are more than 2 and 5 times higher than those of developed countries, respectively. Before 2010, cervical cancer prevention (CECAP) services in Burkina Faso were limited to temporary screening campaigns. Between September 2010 and August 2014, program implementers collaborated with the Ministry of Health and professional associations to implement a CECAP program focused on coupling visual inspection with acetic acid (VIA) for screening with same-day cryotherapy treatment for eligible women in 14 facilities. Women with larger lesions or lesions suspect for cancer were referred for loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). The program trained providers, raised awareness through demand generation activities, and strengthened monitoring capacity. Data on program activities, service provision, and programmatic lessons were analyzed. Three data collection tools, an individual client form, a client registry, and a monthly summary sheet, were used to track 3 key CECAP service indicators: number of women screened using VIA, proportion of women who screened VIA positive, and proportion of women screening VIA positive who received same-day cryotherapy. Over 4 years, the program screened 13,999 women for cervical cancer using VIA; 8.9% screened positive; and 65.9% received cryotherapy in a single visit. The proportion receiving cryotherapy on the same day started at a high of 82% to 93% when services were provided free of charge, but dropped to 51% when a user fee of $10 was applied to cover the cost of supplies. After reducing the fee to $4 in November 2012, the proportion increased again to 78%. Implementation challenges included difficulties tracking referred patients, stock-outs of key supplies, difficulties with machine maintenance, and prohibitive user fees. Providers were trained to independently monitor services, identify gaps, and take corrective actions. Following dissemination of the results that demonstrated the acceptability and feasibility of the CECAP program, the Burkina Faso Ministry of Health included CECAP services in its minimum service delivery package in 2016. Essential components for such programs include provider training on VIA, cryotherapy, and LEEP; provider and patient demand generation; local equipment maintenance; consistent supply stocks; referral system for LEEP; non-prohibitive fees; and a monitoring data collection system.

Migrants often have limited knowledge of public health, including malaria, services in the area, and many seek care from unregulated, private vendors. Between October 2012 and August 2016, we implemented malaria case finding and treatment in Tanintharyi Region, Kayin State, and Rakhine State of Myanmar through 3 entry points: village malaria workers (VMWs), mobile malaria clinics, and screening points. A total of 1,000 VMWs provided passive case detection and treatment services to residents in malaria-endemic villages. Active case finding through mobile malaria clinics was conducted by staff in 354 remote villages and work sites, where regular monitoring and supervision of VMWs would be difficult to maintain. Malaria screening points were a hybrid combination of active and passive case finding in which screening points were set up at fixed locations in Tanintharyi Region and Kayin State, such as bus stops, ferry docks, or informal border crossing points, and migrants entering into or departing from endemic areas could voluntarily receive malaria testing and treatment. Using routine monitoring data, we assessed and compared the malaria positive rate-the number of positive malaria cases out of those tested-across the 3 approaches as an indication of the programmatic effectiveness in identifying malaria cases in the population. Most testing was conducted with rapid diagnostic tests. Mobile teams (169,859) and VMWs (157,048) tested a higher number of community members than screening points (3,676) as they covered a wider geographical area. However, the malaria positive rate was higher among VMWs (7.29%) and screening points (7.10%) than mobile teams (2.64%). VMWs were located in hard-to-access areas that have higher malaria prevalence and are difficult to reach by vehicle while screening points specifically targeted mobile populations and migrant workers. Mobile teams also screened non-fever patients during their visits, which may explain their lower malaria positive rate. A combination of malaria testing approaches helps achieve both maximum reach and high case finding as it allows access to a range of migrant communities and provides an opportunity for continuity of service delivery as the migrants travel to their destinations. ","385":"In 2013, the World Health Organization recommended distribution through schools, health facilities, community health workers, and mass campaigns to maintain coverage with insecticide-treated nets (ITNs). We piloted school distribution in 3 local government areas (LGAs) of Cross River State, Nigeria. From January to March 2011, all 3 study sites participated in a mass ITN campaign. Baseline data were collected in June 2012 (N=753 households) and school distribution began afterward. One ITN per student was distributed to 4 grades once a year in public schools. Obubra LGA distributed ITNs in 2012, 2013, and 2014 and Ogoja LGA in 2013 and 2014 while Ikom LGA served as a comparison site. Pregnant women in all sites were eligible to receive ITNs through standard antenatal care (ANC). Endline survey data (N=1,450 households) were collected in March 2014. Data on ITN ownership, population access to an ITN, and ITN use were gathered and analyzed. Statistical analysis used contingency tables and chi-squared tests for univariate analysis, and a concentration index was calculated to assess equity in ITN ownership. Between baseline and endline, household ownership of at least 1 ITN increased in the intervention sites, from 50% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 44.7, 54.3) to 76% (95% CI: 71.2, 81.0) in Ogoja and from 51% (95% CI: 35.3, 66.7) to 78% (95% CI: 71.5, 83.1) in Obubra, as did population access to ITN, from 36% (95% CI: 32.0, 39.5) to 53% (95% CI: 48.0, 58.0) in Ogoja and from 34% (95% CI: 23.2, 45.6) to 55% in Obubra (95% CI: 48.4, 60.9). In contrast, ITN ownership declined in the comparison site, from 64% (95% CI: 56.4, 70.8) to 43% (95% CI: 37.4, 49.4), as did population ITN access, from 47% (95% CI: 40.0, 53.7) to 26% (95% CI: 21.9, 29.9). Ownership of school ITNs was nearly as equitable (concentration index 0.06 [95% CI: 0.02, 0.11]) as for campaign ITNs (-0.03 [95% CI: -0.08, 0.02]), and there was no significant oversupply or undersupply among households with ITNs. Schools were the most common source of ITNs at endline and very few households (&lt;2%) had nets from both school and ANC. ITN distribution through schools and ANC provide complementary reach and can play an effective role in achieving and maintaining universal coverage. More research is needed to evaluate the cost-effectiveness of such continuous distribution channels in combination with, or as a potential replacement for, subsequent mass campaigns. ","386":"","387":"Many countries rely on standard recipes for accelerating progress toward universal health coverage (UHC). With limited generalizable empirical evidence, expert confidence and consensus plays a major role in shaping country policy choices. This article presents an exploratory attempt conducted between April and September 2016 to measure confidence and consensus among a panel of global health experts in terms of the effectiveness and feasibility of a number of policy options commonly proposed for achieving UHC in low- and middle-income countries, such as fee exemptions for certain groups of people, ring-fenced domestic health budgets, and public-private partnerships. To ensure a relative homogeneity of contexts, we focused on French-speaking sub-Saharan Africa. We initially used the Delphi method to arrive at expert consensus, but since no consensus emerged after 2 rounds, we adjusted our approach to a statistical analysis of the results from our questionnaire by measuring the degree of consensus on each policy option through 100 (signifying total consensus) minus the size of the interquartile range of the individual scores. Seventeen global health experts from various backgrounds, but with at least 20 years' experience in the broad region, participated in the 2 rounds of the study. The results provide an initial \"mapping\" of the opinions of a group of experts and suggest interesting lessons. For the 18 policy options proposed, consensus emerged only on strengthening the supply of quality primary health care services (judged as being effective with a confidence score of 79 and consensus score of 90), and on fee exemptions for the poorest (judged as being fairly easy to implement with a confidence score of 66 and consensus score of 85). For none of the 18 common policy options was there consensus on both potential effectiveness and feasibility, with very diverging opinions concerning 5 policy options. The lack of confidence and consensus within the panel seems to reflect the lack of consistent evidence on the proposed policy options. This suggests that experts' opinions should be framed within strengthened inclusive and \"evidence-informed deliberative processes\" where the trade-offs along the 3 dimensions of UHC-extending the population covered against health hazards, expanding the range of services and benefits covered, and reducing out-of-pocket expenditures-can be discussed in a transparent and contextualized setting.","388":"Formative research is essential to designing both study instruments and interventions in global health. While formative research may employ many qualitative methods, focus group discussions and in-depth interviews are the most common. Observation is less common but can generate insights unlikely to emerge from any other method. This article presents 4 case studies in which observation revealed critical insights: corralling domestic poultry to reduce childhood diarrhea, promoting insecticide-treated bed nets (ITNs) to prevent malaria, evaluating skilled birth attendant competency to manage life-threatening obstetric and neonatal complications, and assessing community health worker (CHW) ability to use malaria rapid diagnostic tests (RDTs). Observation of Zambian CHWs to design malaria RDT training materials revealed a need for training on how to take finger-stick blood samples, a procedure second nature to many health workers but one that few CHWs had ever performed. In Lima, Peru, study participants reported keeping their birds corralled \"all the time,\" but observers frequently found them loose, a difference potentially explained by an alternative interpretation of the phrase \"all the time\" to mean \"all the time (except at some specific seemingly obvious times).\" In the Peruvian Amazon, observation revealed a potential limitation of bed net efficacy due to the built environment: In houses constructed on stilts, many people sleep directly on the floor, allowing mosquitoes to bite from below through gaps in the floorboards. Observation forms and checklists from each case study are included as supplemental files; these may serve as models for designing new observation guides. The case studies illustrate the value of observation to clearly understanding clinical practices and skills, details about how people carry out certain tasks, routine behaviors people would most likely not think to describe in an interview, and environmental barriers that must be overcome if an intervention is to succeed. Observation provides a way to triangulate for social desirability bias and to measure details that interview or focus group participants are unlikely to recognize, remember, or be able to describe with precision.","389":null,"390":"","391":"","392":"","393":"Palm oil consumption is potentially deleterious to human health, and its production has resulted in 11 million hectares of deforestation globally. Importing roughly 394,000 metric tons of palm oil in 2012 alone, the Burmese government has recently pushed for intensive oil palm development to sate domestic demand for consumption and become international market players. Given well-studied linkages between biodiversity loss and ecosystem instability, this study aims to characterize the nature of deforestation for oil palm production in Myanmar, its relationship to increased biodiversity loss, and contextualize the potential impacts of this loss on diets and human health in rural Myanmar. First, a GIS land suitability analysis overlaying spatial data on rainfall, elevation, and slope was conducted in order to identify areas of Myanmar best suited to oil palm tree growth. Second, after narrowing the geographic range, vegetation indices using varying spectral band models in ENVI (Environment for Visualizing Images) allowed a more granular examination of changes in vegetation phenology from 1975 to 2015. Lastly, ground truthing permitted an in-person verification of GIS and ENVI results and provided contextual understanding of oil palm development in Myanmar. GIS analysis revealed that the Tanintharyi Region, one of the most biodiverse regions in Myanmar, is highly suitable for oil palm growth. Next, vegetation indices revealed a progressive shift from smallholder farming, with little observable deforestation between 1975 and 1990, to industrial oil palm plantations all throughout Tanintharyi starting around 2000-a shift concomitant with biodiversity loss of primary forestland. Ground truthing indicated that plantation development has advanced rapidly, though not without barriers to growth. If these trends of Burmese oil palm intensification continue, 4 key outcomes may follow: (1) even higher levels of biodiversity loss, (2) increased access and affordability of edible palm oil, (3) decreased importing of palm oil, and (4) large profits made from selling excess palm oil on the international market. Although the first 2 outcomes may adversely affect low-income Burmese populations, the latter 2 may bode well for the domestic economy and international trade partners, thus encouraging competing interests. This increased domestic access and affordability of palm oil may increase consumption and cause increased prevalence of cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and obesity. Finally, this biodiversity loss concurrent with industrial deforestation may disproportionately impact vulnerable, rural communities. ","394":"The global health field is replete with examples of cross-organizational collaborative partnerships, such as networks, alliances, coalitions, task forces, and working groups, often established to tackle a shared global health concern, condition, or threat affecting low-income countries or communities. The purpose of this article is to review factors influencing the effectiveness of a multi-agency global health collaborative effort using the Chlorhexidine Working Group (CWG) as our case study. The CWG was established to accelerate the introduction and global scale-up of chlorhexidine for umbilical cord care to reduce infection-related neonatal morbidity and mortality in low-income countries. Questions included: how current and past CWG members characterized the effectiveness, productivity, collaboration, and leadership of the CWG; what factors facilitated or hindered group function; institutional or individual reasons for participating and length of participation in the CWG; and lessons that might be relevant for future global collaborative partnerships. Data were collected through in-depth, semistructured individual interviews with 19 group members and a review of key guiding documents. Six domains of internal coalition functioning (leadership, interpersonal relationships, task focus, participant benefits and costs, sustainability planning, and community support) were used to frame and describe the functioning of the CWG. Collaboration effectiveness was found to depend on: (1) leadership that maintained a careful balance between discipline and flexibility, (2) a strong secretariat structure that supported the evolution of trust and transparent communication in interpersonal relationships, (3) shared goals that allowed for task focus, (4) diverse membership and active involvement from country-level participants, which created a positive benefit-cost ratio for participants, (5) sufficient resources to support the partnership and build sustainable capacity for members to accelerate the transfer of knowledge, and (6) support from the global health community across multiple organizations. Successful introduction and scale-up of new health interventions require effective collaboration across multiple organizations and disciplines, at both global and country levels. The participatory collaborative partnership approach utilized by the Chlorhexidine Working Group offers an instructive learning case.","395":"Unmet need for family planning in the conflict-affected area of eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) has been reported to be as high as 38%, and women in such conflict settings are often the most at risk for maternal mortality. The International Rescue Committee implements the Family Planning and Post-Abortion Care in Emergencies program in 3 provinces of eastern DRC to provide women and couples access to family planning, including long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs). This article presents routine program data from June 2011 through December 2013 from 2 health zones as well as results from a qualitative assessment of family planning clients and of male and female non-users, conducted in 2013. It then describes how these findings were used to make program adjustments to improve access to family planning services and client informed choice and assesses the effects of the program design changes on family planning uptake and method mix using routine program data from January 2014 through December 2016. Between 2011 and 2013, 8,985 clients adopted family planning, with an average 14 clients adopting a method per facility, per month. The method mix remained stable during this period, with implants dominating at 48%. Barriers to uptake identified from the qualitative research were both supply- and demand-related, including misconceptions about certain modern contraceptive methods on the part of providers, users, and other community members. The program implemented several program changes based on the assessment findings, including clinical coaching and supportive supervision to improve provider skills and attitudes, introduction of immediate postpartum insertion of the intrauterine device (IUD) and the levonorgestrel-releasing intrauterine system (LNG-IUS), and behavior change communication campaigns to raise awareness about family planning. After these program changes, the mean number of clients adopting modern family planning per facility, per month increased from 14 to 37 and the percentage of family planning adopters choosing LARCs increased from 50% to 66%. While implants continued to be the most dominant method, reaching 60% of the method mix in 2016, the percentage of clients adopting IUDs increased each year, from 3% in 2014 to 13% in 2016. In total, 39,399 clients started family planning methods during the post-program design change period (2014-2016). Our experience in eastern DRC demonstrates that women and their partners affected by conflict want family planning, and that it is feasible to deliver the full range of modern contraceptive methods when programs are adapted and sensitive to the local context.","396":"Since the 1930s, Mexico has made substantial progress in providing adolescents with sexuality education through an evolving national school-based program. As part of a broader effort to document strategies to build support for and deal with resistance to sexuality education, this analysis uses a historical lens to answer 2 key questions: (1) How has the nature of sexuality education in Mexico evolved from the 1930s to the 2010s? (2) How have the drivers, responses, support, and resistance to sexuality education impacted Mexico's experience implementing and sustaining school-based sexuality education? The analysis was informed by a review of peer-reviewed and gray literature as well as the personal experience and documents of one of the authors, who has played a central role in Mexico's sexuality education effort for 50 years. The findings were organized according to 4 time periods-the 1930s, the 1970s, the 1990s, and the first 2 decades of the 21st century-that emerged during the analysis as distinct periods with regard to the social and political context of school-based sexuality education. Within each of these time periods, the following 4 thematic aspects were assessed: drivers, responses, support, and resistance, with a particular focus on the rationales and strategies of resistance over time.Findings: This analysis identified determined support for school-based sexuality education in the 4 historical time periods from a range of governmental and nongovernmental stakeholders. However, opposition to sexuality education also steadily rose in the time period considered, with a growing range of more organized and well-financed actors. The Mexican government's commitment to delivering school-based sexuality education has driven its inclusion in public schools, along with expansion of its curricula from primarily biological content to a more comprehensive approach. Mexico's experience with sexuality education can inform other countries' efforts to consider the drivers, responses, support, and resistance that may be present in their own contexts. This type of analysis can contribute to strategic, well-informed, and well-conceived programmatic design and implementation to build support for sexuality education and deal with resistance. ","397":"We evaluated an adaptation of a large-scale community-based management of acute malnutrition program run by an NGO with government partnerships, in informal settlements of Mumbai, India. The program aimed to reduce the prevalence of wasting among children under age 3 and covered a population of approximately 300,000. This study used a mixed-methods approach including a quasi-experimental design to compare prevalence estimates of wasting in intervention areas with neighboring informal settlements. Cross-sectional data were collected from March through November 2014 for the baseline and October through December 2015 for the endline. Endline data were analyzed using mixed-effects logistic regression models, adjusting for child, maternal, and household characteristics. In addition, we conducted in-depth interviews with 37 stakeholders (13 staff and 24 mothers) who reported on salient features that contributed to successful implementation of the program. We interviewed 2,578 caregivers at baseline and 3,455 at endline in intervention areas. In comparison areas, we interviewed 2,082 caregivers at baseline and 2,122 at endline. At endline, the prevalence of wasting decreased by 28% (18% to 13%) in intervention areas and by 5% (16.9% to 16%) in comparison areas. Analysis of the endline data indicated that children in intervention areas were significantly less likely to be malnourished (adjusted odds ratio, 0.81; confidence interval, 0.67 to 0.99). Stakeholders identified 4 main features as contributing to the success of the program: (1) tailoring and reinforcement of information provided to caregivers in informal settings, (2) constant field presence of staff, (3) holistic case management of issues beyond immediate malnourishment, and (4) persistence of field staff in persuading reluctant families. Staff capabilities were enhanced through training, stringent monitoring mechanisms, and support from senior staff in tackling difficult cases. NGO-government partnerships can revitalize existing community-based programs in urban India. Critical to success are processes that include reinforced knowledge-building of caregivers, a high level of field support and encouragement to the community, and constant monitoring and follow-up of cases by all staff levels. ","398":"Sub-Saharan Africa has an inadequate number of health professionals, leading to a reduced capacity to respond to health challenges, including HIV\/AIDS. From 2010 to 2015, the Medical Education Partnership Initiative (MEPI)-sponsored by the U.S. Presidents Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief (PEPFAR) and the National Institutes of Health (NIH)-was enthusiastically taken up by the University of Zimbabwe College of Health Sciences (UZCHS) and 12 other sub-Saharan African universities to develop models of training to improve medical education and research capacity. In this article, we describe the outcomes and challenges of MEPI in Zimbabwe. UZCHS in partnership with the University of Colorado, Denver; Stanford University; University of Cape Town; University College London; and King's College London designed the Novel Education Clinical Trainees and Researchers (NECTAR) program and 2 linked awards addressing cardiovascular disease and mental health to pursue MEPI objectives. A range of medical education and research capacity-focused programs were implemented, including faculty development, research support, mentored scholars, visiting professors, community-based education, information and technology support, cross-cutting curricula, and collaboration with partner universities and the ministries of health and education. We analyzed quantitative and qualitative data from several data sources, including annual surveys of faculty, students, and other stakeholders; workshop exit surveys; and key informant interviews with NECTAR administrators and leaders and the UZCHS dean. Improved Internet connectivity and electronic resource availability were early successes of NECTAR. Over the 5-year period, 69% (115 of 166) of faculty members attended at least 1 of 15 faculty development workshops. Forty-one faculty members underwent 1-year advanced faculty development training in medical education and leadership. Thirty-three mentored research scholars were trained under NECTAR, and 52 and 12 in cardiovascular and mental health programs, respectively. Twelve MEPI scholars had joined faculty by 2015. Full-time faculty grew by 36% (122 to 166), annual postgraduate and medical student enrollment increased by 61% (75 to 121) and 71% (123 to 210), respectively. To institutionalize and sustain MEPI innovations, the Research Support Center and the Department of Health Professions Education were established at UZCHS. MEPI has synergistically revitalized medical education, research capacity, and leadership at UZCHS. Investments in creating a new research center, health professions education department, and, programs have laid the foundation to help sustain faculty development and research capacity in the country. ","399":"PATH partnered with the United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and country ministries of health (MOHs) to coordinate pilot introductions of subcutaneous depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (subcutaneous DMPA or DMPA-SC, brand name Sayana Press) in Burkina Faso, Niger, Senegal, and Uganda from July 2014 through June 2016 in order to expand the range of methods available to women, particularly in remote locations. The pilot introductions aimed to answer key questions that would inform decisions about future investments in DMPA-SC and scaling up product availability and service-delivery innovations nationally. These questions included the extent to which DMPA-SC would appeal to first-time users of modern contraception, as well as adolescent girls and young women; whether DMPA-SC would add value to family planning programs or simply replace DMPA-IM or other modern methods; and the trends in injectables use when introducing DMPA-SC (or any injectable) at the community level for the first time. We implemented a multicountry monitoring system to track key indicators, including the number of doses administered by category of user (e.g., new users, by client age group) or delivery channel. Providers generally collected these data using their national programs' standard family planning registers. Data were analyzed for cumulative information and to examine trends over time using Microsoft Power Query for Excel and Tableau. Across the 4 countries, nearly half a million DMPA-SC doses were administered and approximately 135,000 first-time users of modern contraception were reached. Furthermore, 44% of the doses administered in 3 of the countries with data were to adolescent girls and young women under age 25. Switching from DMPA-IM to DMPA-SC was not widespread, ranging from 7% in Burkina Faso to 16% in Uganda. Results from these pilot introductions demonstrate that DMPA-SC has the potential to expand community-level access to injectables, maximize task-sharing strategies, and reach young women and new acceptors of family planning. Considered within the context of each country's setting, training approach, and introduction strategy, these results can help stakeholders in other countries make informed decisions about whether and how to include this contraceptive option in their family planning programs.","400":"Momentum for family planning in the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) is evident in multiple ways: strong political will, increasing donor support, a growing number of implementing organizations, innovative family planning programming, and a cohesive family planning stakeholder group. Between 2013 and 2017, the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) in the capital city of Kinshasa increased from 18.5% to 26.7% among married women, but as of 2013-14, it was only 7.8% at the national level. The National Multisectoral Strategic Plan for Family Planning: 2014-2020 calls for achieving an mCPR of 19.0% by 2020, an ambitious goal in light of formidable challenges to family planning in the DRC. Of the 16,465 health facilities reporting to the national health information system in 2017, only 40% offer family planning services. Key challenges include uncertainty over the political situation, difficulties of ensuring access to family planning services in a vast country with a weak transportation infrastructure, funding shortfalls for procuring adequate quantities of contraceptives, weak contraceptive logistics and supply chain management, strong cultural norms that favor large families, and low capacity of the population to pay for contraceptive services. This article describes promising initiatives designed to address these barriers, consistent with the World Health Organization's framework for health systems strengthening. For example, the national family planning coordinating mechanism is being replicated at the provincial level to oversee the expansion of family planning service delivery. Promising initiatives are being implemented to improve the supply and quality of services and generate demand for family planning, including social marketing of subsidized contraceptives at both traditional and non-traditional channels and strengthening of services in military health facilities. To expand contraceptive access, family planning is being institutionalized in nursing schools, allowing students to operate as community-based distributors. While major challenges remain, significant progress in family planning has been made in the DRC, which should be judged not in comparison with sub-Saharan African countries with high mCPR and mature programs, but rather with those starting from much further behind.","401":"","402":"","403":"This article draws from national surveys of every sub-Saharan African country with at least 1 recent survey published between 2015 and 2017 and 2 prior surveys from 2003 to 2014. Twelve countries comprising over 60% of the region's population met these inclusion criteria. The analysis considers recent and longer-term changes in 3 key variables: modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR), method-specific prevalence, and a method's share of the current modern method mix. As recently as 2011, implant CPR in sub-Saharan Africa was only 1.1%. Since then, sizeable price reductions, much-increased commodity supply, greater government commitment to rights-based family planning, broader WHO eligibility guidance, and wider adoption of high-impact service delivery practices have resulted in expanded client access and marked increases in implant prevalence and share of the method mix. Ten of the 12 countries now have an implant CPR around 6% or higher, with 3 countries above 11%. Increased implant use has been the main driver of the increased mCPR attained by 11 countries, with gains in implant use alone exceeding combined gains in use of injectables, pills, and intrauterine devices. In countries as diverse as Burkina Faso and Ethiopia, Democratic Republic of the Congo and Ghana, Kenya and Senegal, implant use now accounts for one-fourth to one-half of all modern method use. Implants have become the first or second most widely used method in 10 countries. In the 7 countries with multiple surveys conducted over a 2- to 3-year span between 2013-14 and 2016-17, average annual gains in implant prevalence range from 0.97 to 4.15 percentage points; this contrasts to historical annual gains in use of all modern methods of 0.70 percentage points in 42 sub-Saharan African countries from 1986 to 2008. Implant use has risen substantially and fairly equitably across almost all sociodemographic categories, including unmarried women, women of lower and higher parity, women in all 5 wealth quintiles, younger and older women, and women residing in rural areas. A notable exception is the category of nulliparous married women, whose implant use is mostly below 1%. These attainments represent a major success story not often seen in family planning programming. With continued program commitment and donor support, these trends in implant uptake and popularity are likely to continue for the next few years. This implies even greater need for the international family planning community to maintain its focus on rights-based programming, ensuring reliable access to implant removal as well as insertion services, and addressing issues of financing and sustainability.","404":"","405":null,"406":"The need for annual family planning program tracking data under the Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) initiative has contributed to renewed interest in family planning service statistics as a potential data source for annual estimates of the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR). We sought to assess (1) how well a set of commonly recorded data elements in routine service statistics systems could, with some fairly simple adjustments, track key population-level outcome indicators, and (2) whether some data elements performed better than others. We used data from 22 countries in Africa and Asia to analyze 3 data elements collected from service statistics: (1) number of contraceptive commodities distributed to clients, (2) number of family planning service visits, and (3) number of current contraceptive users. Data quality was assessed via analysis of mean square errors, using the United Nations Population Division World Contraceptive Use annual mCPR estimates as the \"gold standard.\" We also examined the magnitude of several components of measurement error: (1) variance, (2) level bias, and (3) slope (or trend) bias. Our results indicate modest levels of tracking error for data on commodities to clients (7%) and service visits (10%), and somewhat higher error rates for data on current users (19%). Variance and slope bias were relatively small for all data elements. Level bias was by far the largest contributor to tracking error. Paired comparisons of data elements in countries that collected at least 2 of the 3 data elements indicated a modest advantage of data on commodities to clients. None of the data elements considered was sufficiently accurate to be used to produce reliable stand-alone annual estimates of mCPR. However, the relatively low levels of variance and slope bias indicate that trends calculated from these 3 data elements can be productively used in conjunction with the Family Planning Estimation Tool (FPET) currently used to produce annual mCPR tracking estimates for FP2020.","407":"Despite international recommendations and supportive evidence, there are few examples of scaled-up and sustained programs to provide adolescents with sexuality education. Moreover, despite acknowledgment that building community support and responding to resistance are key challenges, there is a lack of detailed discussion on specific programmatic strategies to address these issues. This article reviews the work of 2 organizations-Aahung and Rutgers Pakistan-that are successfully implementing large-scale sexuality education programs in Pakistan, collectively reaching more than 500,000 students. This review aims to answer the following questions: (1) How did Aahung and Rutgers Pakistan work to understand Pakistani society and culture and shape their programs to build community support? (2) How did Aahung and Rutgers Pakistan overcome resistance to their efforts? We reviewed program documents and publications, synthesized key themes, identified questions of interest, and engaged key informants from Aahung and Rutgers Pakistan's leadership. The success of Aahung and Rutgers Pakistan was grounded in their readiness to understand the nuanced context within the communities, collaborate with groups of stakeholders-including parents, school officials, religious leaders, media personnel, and adolescents themselves-to ensure support, and stand up to forces of resistance to pursue their goals. Specific strategies included working with communities to select content, tactfully selecting and framing issues with careful consideration for sensitivities, engaging adolescents' influencers, strengthening media presence, showcasing school programs to increase understanding and transparency, and choosing opportune times to introduce messages. The successful strategies used by Aahung and Rutgers Pakistan to promote adolescent sexual and reproductive health through sexuality education can inform programs worldwide. Additionally, the programmatic weaknesses identified can guide future planning and action by Aahung and Rutgers Pakistan. We call on other programs to continue sharing challenges, specifically related to resistance, with sexuality education programs in order to develop a toolbox of additional strategies for community uptake. ","408":"Visceral leishmaniasis (VL) is endemic to 54 districts in 4 states of India. Poor awareness of the disease and inappropriate health-seeking behavior are major challenges to eliminating the disease. Between February 2016 and March 2017, we implemented a behavior change communication (BCC) intervention in 33 districts of Bihar, 4 districts of Jharkhand, and 3 districts of West Bengal using a mix of channels, including group and interpersonal communication, to improve knowledge, attitudes, and practices of communities, frontline health workers, and opinion leaders. We conducted an impact assessment in October 2016, after the second indoor residual spraying (IRS) round, in Bihar and Jharkhand to evaluate the effect of the BCC intervention. Villages in 10 districts of Bihar and 4 districts in Jharkhand were selected for inclusion in the assessment. Selected villages were categorized as either intervention or control based on where project activities were conducted. Households were randomly selected proportional to caste composition, and interviewers surveyed the head of the household on whether the house was sprayed during the last IRS round and on knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to VL. We interviewed 700 households in intervention villages and 350 households in control villages and conducted correlation analysis to explore the association between IRS refusal and socioeconomic variables, and tested for association between IRS refusal and exposure to BCC activities. Odds ratios (ORs) were calculated. We reached an estimated 3.3 million contacts in Bihar and Jharkhand through the intervention's BCC activities. IRS refusal rates were significantly lower in intervention households than control households (mean=7.95% vs. 24.45%, respectively; OR, 0.27; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.11 to 0.62; P&lt;.001). Households in intervention villages were more aware than those in control villages that VL is spread by sand flies (68.4% vs. 7.4%, respectively; P&lt;.001) and of IRS as an effective control measure (82.3% vs. 41.7%, respectively; P&lt;.001). A greater percentage of households in intervention villages than control villages indicated they would encourage a patient to go to primary health centers for diagnosis and treatment of VL (77.0% vs. 39.4%, respectively) and to encourage others to accept IRS (78.6% vs. 44.6%, respectively; P&lt;.001). Households that were exposed to community-based BCC activities largely using group and interpersonal communication had better knowledge, attitudes, and practices related to VL, including acceptance of IRS as a preventive measure, than households not exposed. BCC activities are thus an important component of VL elimination strategies. ","409":"The subcutaneous (SC) injectable, widely known by its commercial name Sayana Press, has potential to improve access to contraceptive methods. In Burkina Faso, SC-injectables were first piloted in select regions in 2014 and introduced nationally in 2016. PMA2020 is the first national survey to track programmatic progress of SC-injectable introduction at both population and health facility levels in the country across 2 rounds of data collection: March-May 2016 and November 2016-January 2017. Over this 6-month period, SC-injectable availability at public service delivery points increased from 50% to 85%, largely driven by increases in availability among the non-pilot regions. In terms of use, while the modern contraceptive prevalence rate among all women remained constant at about 23%, SC-injectable prevalence nearly doubled from 1.1% to 2.0%, making up approximately 9% of all modern method users in Burkina Faso by late 2016, though the difference was not statistically significant. Increases were comparable between pilot and non-pilot regions. While the difference was not statistically significant, more rural women were using the method compared with their urban counterparts in the pilot regions, an interesting finding considering the opposite pattern is generally true for contraceptive prevalence nationally. In summary, following national scale-up, data show substantially improved availability of SC-injectables at service delivery points and potential for changes in the method mix in Burkina Faso. In order to further improve contraceptive access and choice, scale-up of community-based distribution of SC-injectables should be considered, especially among rural populations with higher unmet need for family planning.","410":"","411":"","412":null,"413":"The United Nations Population Fund (UNFPA) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID) DELIVER PROJECT work together to strengthen public health commodity supply chains by standardizing bar coding under a single set of global standards. From 2015, UNFPA and USAID collaborated to pilot test how tracking and tracing of bar coded health products could be operationalized in the public health supply chains of Ethiopia and Pakistan and inform the ecosystem needed to begin full implementation. Pakistan had been using proprietary bar codes for inventory management of contraceptive supplies but transitioned to global standards-based bar codes during the pilot. The transition allowed Pakistan to leverage the original bar codes that were preprinted by global manufacturers as opposed to printing new bar codes at the central warehouse. However, barriers at lower service delivery levels prevented full realization of end-to-end data visibility. Key barriers at the district level were the lack of a digital inventory management system and absence of bar codes at the primary-level packaging level, such as single blister packs. The team in Ethiopia developed an open-sourced smartphone application that allowed the team to scan bar codes using the mobile phone's camera and to push the captured data to the country's data mart. Real-time tracking and tracing occurred from the central warehouse to the Addis Ababa distribution hub and to 2 health centers. These pilots demonstrated that standardized product identification and bar codes can significantly improve accuracy over manual stock counts while significantly streamlining the stock-taking process, resulting in efficiencies. The pilots also showed that bar coding technology by itself is not sufficient to ensure data visibility. Rather, by using global standards for identification and data capture of pharmaceuticals and medical devices, and integrating the data captured into national and global tracking systems, countries are able to lay the foundation for interoperability and ensure a harmonized language between global health stakeholders.","414":"Poor blood pressure control results in tremendous morbidity and mortality in India where the leading cause of death among adults is from coronary heart disease. Despite having little formal education, community health workers (CHWs) are integral to successful public health interventions in India and other low- and middle-income countries that have a shortage of trained health professionals. Training CHWs to screen for and manage chronic hypertension, with support from trained clinicians, offers an excellent opportunity for effecting systemwide change in hypertension-related burden of disease. In this article, we describe the development of a program that trained CHWs between 2014 and 2015 in the tribal region of the Sittilingi Valley in southern India, to identify hypertensive patients in the community, refer them for diagnosis and initial management in a physician-staffed clinic, and provide them with sustained lifestyle interventions and medications over multiple visits. We found that after 2 years, the CHWs had screened 7,176 people over age 18 for hypertension, 1,184 (16.5%) of whom were screened as hypertensive. Of the 1,184 patients screened as hypertensive, 898 (75.8%) had achieved blood pressure control, defined as a systolic blood pressure less than 140 and a diastolic blood pressure less than 90 sustained over 3 consecutive visits. While all of the 24 trained CHWs reported confidence in checking blood pressure with a manual blood pressure cuff, 4 of the 24 CHWs reported occasional difficulty documenting blood pressure values because they were unable to write numbers properly. They compensated by asking other CHWs or members of their community to help with documentation. Our experience and findings suggest that a CHW blood pressure screening system linked to a central clinic can be a promising avenue for improving hypertension control rates in low- and middle-income countries.","415":null,"416":"Food and nutrition security in eastern Democratic Republic of the Congo are threatened by political instability and chronic poverty. The Jenga Jamaa II project, implemented between 2011 and 2016 in South Kivu Province, aimed to improve household food security and child nutritional status using various intervention strategies, including farmer field school (FFS) programs. To characterize the changes in agricultural production techniques, household food security, and child nutritional status associated with participation in FFS programs. We used a community-matched design to select FFS intervention and control households from 3 health zones in which the project was operating. Data on food security (Household Dietary Diversity Score [HDDS] and Household Food Insecurity Access Scale [HFIAS]) and child anthropometry were collected semiannually for 3.5 years in both groups. Additional data on agricultural practices were collected annually in the FFS group only. Focus groups with FFS staff and beneficiaries were conducted in the final project year. Statistical analyses included basic descriptive statistics such as paired t tests and analysis of covariance; regression models using a bootstrap were applied to generate P values and confidence intervals while accounting for differences between groups. The study enrolled 388 FFS beneficiaries and their households in the intervention group and 324 non-FFS households in the control group. FFS participants reported increasing the number of different agricultural techniques they used by an average of 2.7 techniques over the project period, from 5.1 in 2013 to 7.9 in 2016 (P&lt;.001). The mean HDDS and HFIAS improved more in the FFS group than in the control group (mean difference between intervention and control for HDDS was 0.9 points and for HFIAS was -4.6 points; P&lt;.001). However, the prevalence of child stunting (60.2% intervention vs. 58.8% control) and underweight (22.3% intervention vs. 29.8% control) were similar in both groups at endline (P&gt;.05). Although FFS participants diversified their agricultural production strategies and experienced improvements in household food security, there was not a positive impact on child nutritional status. In this food-insecure context, improvements in agricultural production alone are unlikely to significantly change child nutritional status-a health outcome with a complex, multilevel causal chain. ","417":"Health practitioners, researchers, and donors are stumped about Jordan's stalled fertility rate, which has stagnated between 3.7 and 3.5 children per woman from 2002 to 2012, above the national replacement level of 2.1. This stall paralleled United States Agency for International Development (USAID) funding investments in family planning in Jordan, triggering an assessment of USAID family planning programming in Jordan. This article describes the methods, results, and implications of the programmatic assessment. Methods included an extensive desk review of USAID programs in Jordan and 69 interviews with reproductive health stakeholders. We explored reasons for fertility stagnation in Jordan's total fertility rate (TFR) and assessed the effects of USAID programming on family planning outcomes over the same time period. The assessment results suggest that the increased use of less effective methods, in particular withdrawal and condoms, are contributing to Jordan's TFR stall. Jordan's limited method mix, combined with strong sociocultural determinants around reproduction and fertility desires, have contributed to low contraceptive effectiveness in Jordan. Over the same time period, USAID contributions toward increasing family planning access and use, largely focused on service delivery programs, were extensive. Examples of effective initiatives, among others, include task shifting of IUD insertion services to midwives due to a shortage of female physicians. However, key challenges to improved use of family planning services include limited government investments in family planning programs, influential service provider behaviors and biases that limit informed counseling and choice, pervasive strong social norms of family size and fertility, and limited availability of different contraceptive methods. In contexts where sociocultural norms and a limited method mix are the dominant barriers toward improved family planning use, increased national government investments toward synchronized service delivery and social and behavior change activities may be needed to catalyze national-level improvements in family planning outcomes.","418":"The association between increased risk of HIV acquisition and use of progestin-only injectables (POIs) is controversial. We sought to compare the competing risks of maternal mortality and HIV acquisition with use of POIs using updated data on this association and considering an expanded number of African countries. We designed a decision-analytic model to compare the benefits and risks of POIs on the competing risks of maternal mortality and HIV acquisition on life expectancy for women in 9 African countries. For the purposes of this analysis, we assumed that POIs were associated with an increased risk of HIV acquisition (hazards ratio of 1.4). Our primary outcome was life-years and the population was women of reproductive age (15-49 years) in these countries, who did not have HIV infection and were not currently planning a pregnancy. Probabilities for each variable included in the model, such as HIV incidence, access to antiretroviral therapy, and contraceptive prevalence, were obtained from the literature. Univariate and multivariate sensitivity analyses were performed to check model assumptions and explore how uncertainty in estimates would affect the model results. In all countries, discontinuation of POIs without replacement with an equally effective contraceptive method would result in decreased life expectancy due to a significant increase in maternal deaths. While the removal of POIs from the market would result in the prevention of some new cases of HIV, the life-years gained from this are mitigated due to the marked increase in neonatal HIV cases and maternal mortality with associated life-years lost. In all countries, except South Africa, typical-use contraceptive failure rates with POIs would need to exceed 39%, and more than half of women currently using POIs would have to switch to another effective method, for the removal of POIs to demonstrate an increase in total life-years. Women living in sub-Saharan Africa cope with both high rates of HIV infection and high rates of pregnancy-related maternal death relative to the rest of the world. Based on the most current estimates, our model suggests that removal of POI contraception from the market without effective and acceptable contraception replacement would have a net negative effect on maternal health, life expectancy, and mortality under a variety of scenarios. ","419":"Maternal, fetal, and neonatal mortality disproportionately impact low- and middle-income countries, and many current interventions that can save lives are often not available nor appropriate for these settings. Maternal and Neonatal Directed Assessment of Technologies (MANDATE) is a mathematical model designed to evaluate which interventions have the greatest potential to save maternal, fetal, and neonatal lives saved in sub-Saharan Africa and India. The MANDATE decision-support model includes interventions such as preventive interventions, diagnostics, treatments, and transfers to different care settings to compare the relative impact of different interventions on mortality outcomes. The model is calibrated and validated based on historical and current rates of disease in sub-Saharan Africa and India. In addition, each maternal, fetal, or newborn condition included in MANDATE considers disease rates specific to sub-Saharan Africa and India projected to intervention rates similar to those seen in high-income countries. Limitations include variance in quality of data to inform the estimates and generalizability of findings of the effectiveness of the interventions. The model serves as a valuable resource to compare the potential impact of multiple interventions, which could help reduce maternal, fetal, and neonatal mortality in low-resource settings. The user should be aware of assumptions in evaluating the model and interpret results accordingly.","420":"In 2017, of the 22.5 million parenting adolescents (ages 15-19) in 60 countries, approximately 4.1 million gave birth to a second or higher-order child. Adolescent pregnancy in general, and rapid repeat pregnancies specifically, expose young mothers and their children to multiple health and socioeconomic risks. The purpose of this article is to review the impact of interventions designed to prevent unintended, rapid repeat pregnancies among adolescents, including those aimed at changing norms to postpone \"intended\" closely spaced pregnancies to promote healthy spacing. We searched PubMed and other databases for evaluations of interventions published in English from 1990 through 2016. We included evaluations that assessed a programmatic intervention specifically designed to prevent rapid repeat pregnancy (occurring less than 24 months after the index birth) or birth (occurring less than 33 months after the index birth), or that reported on contraceptive continuation for at least 2 years. We first assessed the quality of the evaluations, then ranked the interventions based on the quality of the evaluation and the level of impact on repeat pregnancy or birth (statistically significant impact, positive trends but not statistically significant, or no impact) to identify the most effective interventions. Finally, we extracted program design and implementation lessons from the interventions included in the high-quality evaluations. Our search identified 2,187 articles, of which 40 evaluations met the inclusion criteria (24=high quality, 14=moderate quality, 2=less rigorous). We found 14 high-quality evaluations in which the intervention achieved a statistically significant impact on repeat pregnancy or birth. These interventions fell into 5 broad categories: (1) contraceptive services and information, with proactive monitoring of contraceptive use and outreach to families; (2) postpartum contraceptive counseling and services provided soon after delivery; (3) activities that help adolescents improve planning skills, including preparing contraceptive plans; (4) social and behavioral change activities that help adolescents understand the role contraception can play in determining positive life outcomes, and the implications of their reproductive health decisions for their future; and (5) activities that provide mentoring, goal setting, and motivation. Effective interventions that prevent rapid adolescent childbearing link clinical contraceptive services with non-clinical activities that build planning skills, enhance understanding of the role that contraceptives can play in determining positive life outcomes, and provide mentoring and goal setting. Recognizing potentially synergistic effects, we recommend testing various combinations of these interventions, with access to contraception as the foundational activity. ","421":"","422":"","423":"","424":"One of the primary control measures for malaria transmission is indoor residual spraying (IRS). Historically, few women have worked in IRS programs, despite the income-generating potential. Increasing women's roles in IRS requires understanding the barriers to women's participation and implementing measures to address them. The U.S. President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) Africa Indoor Residual Spraying (AIRS) Project is the largest implementer of IRS globally. To address gender inequity in IRS operations, PMI AIRS assessed the barriers to the participation of women and developed and implemented policies to address these barriers. The PMI AIRS Project initially identified barriers through a series of informal assessments with key stakeholders. PMI AIRS then implemented a series of gender-guided policies, starting in 2015, in Benin, Ethiopia, Ghana, Mali, Madagascar, Mozambique, Rwanda, Senegal, Zambia, and Zimbabwe. The policies included adapting physical work environments to ensure privacy for women; ensuring the safety of women in the workplace; guaranteeing safety and job security of women during pregnancy; and encouraging qualified women to apply for supervisory positions. The project collected routine programmatic data on staff, spray quality, and spray efficiency; data from 2012 through the end of 2015 were analyzed (up through 1 year after implementation of the gender policies). In addition, PMI AIRS conducted surveys in 2015, 2016, and 2017 before and after the spray campaigns in 4 countries to determine changes in gender norms among spray operators through questions about decision making and agency. The PMI AIRS Project increased women's employment with the program. Specifically, women's employment increased overall from 23% in 2012 to 29% in 2015, with a 2015 range from 16% (Mali) to 40% (Madagascar). Growth among supervisor roles was even stronger, with the percentage of women in supervisory roles increasing from 17% in 2012 to 46% in 2015, with a 2015 range from 9% (Mali) to 50% (Madagascar). While the data showed that in most countries women sprayed fewer houses per day than men in 2015, the differences were not meaningful, ranging from 0.1 to 1.2 households per day. Gender norms shifted toward more egalitarian views in 2 of the 4 countries with survey data. Preliminary results suggest the PMI AIRS Project gender policies are increasing the engagement of women in all aspects of spray operations, especially in supervisory roles. Expansion of these policies to all countries implementing IRS and to malaria control implementation more broadly is recommended. ","425":"In 2009, the Ethiopian Federal Ministry of Health launched an Implanon scale-up program with the goal of improving the availability of long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC) methods at the community level. The Integrated Family Health Program (IFHP) supported the ministry to train Health Extension Workers (HEWs), a cadre of frontline health workers, on Implanon insertion. Prior to this task-sharing initiative, HEWs were only permitted to provide short-acting contraceptive methods; Implanon insertion services were only available at higher-level health facilities, such as health centers and above. To train HEWs on Implanon insertion, IFHP followed a phase-based approach, which consisted of a learning phase (July to September 2009) that transitioned into a scale-up phase (December 2009 to December 2015). Training began with a series of service delivery-based training of trainers (TOT) sessions for clinical care providers selected from health centers followed by rollout trainings on Implanon insertion for HEWs selected from health posts. Immediately after the Implanon rollout trainings, each trained HEW was provided with consumables and Implanon implants to enable them to initiate the Implanon services at their respective health post. To reinforce knowledge and skills, we conducted mentoring visits and performance review meetings. From July 2009 to September 2015, 98 TOT sessions trained 2,328 clinicians and 320 rollout trainings reached 8,436 HEWs. A total of 1,382,318 women received contraceptive services through any IFHP-supported service delivery point, 1,273,990 of whom received an Implanon implant. The IFHP approach proved to be a successful model for increasing access to contraceptive methods in the community, and the program supported the integration of Implanon services into the existing public health service delivery system.","426":"Estimates of the potential impacts of contraceptive use on averting unintended pregnancies, total and unsafe abortions, maternal deaths, and newborn, infant, and child deaths provide evidence of the value of investments in family planning programs and thus are critically important for policy makers, donors, and advocates alike. Several research teams have independently developed mathematical models that estimate the number of adverse health outcomes averted due to contraceptive use. However, each modeling approach was designed for different purposes, and as such the methodological assumptions, data inputs, and mathematical algorithms initially used in each model differed; consequently, the models did not produce comparable estimates for the same outcome indicators. To address this, a series of expert group meetings took place in which 5 models-Adding it Up, Impact 2, ImpactNow, Reality Check, and FamPlan\/Lives Saved Tool (LiST)-were reviewed and harmonized where possible. The group identified the main reasons for the inconsistencies in the estimates generated by the models for each of the adverse health outcome indicators. The group then worked together to align the methodologies for estimating numbers of unintended pregnancies, abortions, and maternal deaths averted due to contraceptive use, and reviewed the challenges with estimating the impact of contraceptive use on newborn, infant, and child deaths, including the lack of a conceptually clear pathway and rigorous evidence. The assumption that most influenced harmonization was the comparison pregnancy rate used by the models to estimate the counterfactual scenario-that is, if women who are currently using contraception were not using a method, how many would become pregnant? All the models now base this on the number of unintended pregnancies among women with unmet contraceptive need, bringing the estimates for unintended pregnancies, total and unsafe abortion, and maternal deaths much closer together. The agreed approaches have already been adopted by the Family Planning 2020 (FP2020) initiative and Track20, a project that supports FP2020. The experts will continue to update their models collaboratively to ensure that the most current estimation methodologies and data available are used. Valid and reliable methodologies for estimating these impacts from family planning are critically important, not only for advocacy to sustain resource allocation commitments but also to enable measurement and tracking of global development indicators. Conflicting estimates can be counterproductive to generating support for family planning programs, and this harmonization process has created a more unified voice for quantifying the benefits of family planning.","427":"","428":"","429":"Optimal breastfeeding is of vital importance to infant and child health and has been adopted by countries as a standard recommendation. However, in the context of an infectious disease outbreak, especially when the disease is poorly understood, policy makers must balance the benefits of breastfeeding against the risk of disease transmission through breastfeeding. During the 2014-2015 Ebola Virus Disease (EVD) outbreak in Sierra Leone, the development of correct and consistent messaging about infant feeding and nutrition programming was considerably delayed by numerous challenges. These challenges included a lack of sufficient information about the risk of transmission through human milk, numerous stakeholders, limited communication between coordination pillars, inconsistent and evolving messages from various stakeholders, and the public's distrust of the health system and international actors. For improved response to future disease outbreaks, research on vertical transmission of EVD should be prioritized, infant and young child feeding experts should be integrated into outbreak response collaboration, and a digital repository of potential and appropriately tailored messages should be created.","430":"The objective of this article is to describe summer field experiences at the Rollins School of Public Health. An online survey was conducted among Master of Public Health students returning from summer field experiences. We used printed reports from 2004-2012 and original survey data from 2010-2013 to perform a trend analysis using correlation analysis and linear regression. We found that our students have worked for more than 300 organizations in 84 countries. The average cost of a summer field experience fluctuated around US$3,500, with students receiving an average of US$2,180 in funding. About 50% of students conducted human subjects research. This survey was used to improve student practical experiences through information sessions for students and feedback to key constituents, including the Emory Institutional Review Board and the Emory Travel Clinic.","431":"From 2001 to 2011, modern contraceptive prevalence in Uganda increased from 18% to 26%. However, modern method use, in particular use of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) and permanent methods (PMs), remained low. In the 2011 Uganda Demographic and Health Survey, only 1 of 5 married women used a LARC or PM even though 34% indicated an unmet need for contraception. Between 2011 and 2014, a social franchise and family planning voucher program, supporting 400 private facilities to provide family planning counseling and broaden contraceptive choice by adding LARCs and PMs to the service mix, offered a voucher to enable poor women to access family planning services at franchised facilities. This study analyzes service trends and voucher client demographics and estimates the contribution of the program to increasing contraceptive prevalence in Uganda, using the Impact 2 model developed by Marie Stopes International. Between March 2011 and December 2014, 330,826 women received a family planning service using the voucher, of which 70% of voucher clients chose an implant and 25% chose an intrauterine device. The median age of voucher users was 28 years; 79% had no education or only a primary education; and 48% reported they were unemployed or a housewife. We estimated that by 2014, 280,000 of the approximately 8,600,000 women of reproductive age in Uganda were using a contraceptive method provided by the program and that 120,000 of the clients were \"additional users\" of contraception, contributing 1.4 percentage points to the national modern contraceptive prevalence rate. The combination of family planning vouchers and a franchise-based quality improvement initiative can leverage existing private health infrastructure to substantially expand family planning access and choice for disadvantaged populations and potentially improve contraceptive prevalence when scaled nationally.","432":"A significant determinant of population health outcomes is the quality of care provided for noncommunicable diseases, obstetric, and pediatric care. We present results on clinical practice quality in these areas as measured among nearly 4,000 providers working at more than 1,000 facilities in 6 Eastern European and Central Asian countries. This study was conducted between March 2011 and April 2013 in Albania, Armenia, Georgia, Kazakhstan, Kirov Province in Russia, and Tajikistan. Using a probability proportional-to-size sampling technique, based on number of hospital beds, we randomly selected within each country 42 hospitals and their associated primary health care clinics. Physicians and midwives within each clinical area of interest were randomly selected from each hospital and clinic and asked how they would care for simulated patients using Clinical Performance and Value (CPV) vignettes. Facility administrators were also asked to complete a facility survey to collect structural measures of quality. CPV vignettes were scored on a scale of 0% to 100% for each provider. We used descriptive statistics and t tests to identify significant differences in CPV scores between hospitals and clinics and rural vs. urban facilities, and ANOVA to identify significant differences in CPV scores across countries. We found that quality of care, as concurrently measured by performance on CPV vignettes, was generally poor and widely variable within and between countries. Providers in Kirov Province, Russia, had the highest overall performance, with an average score of 70.8%, while providers in Albania and Tajikistan had the lowest average score, each at 50.8%. The CPV vignettes with the lowest scores were for multiple noncommunicable disease risk factors and birth asphyxia. A considerable proportion (11%) of providers performed well on the CPV vignettes, regardless of country, facility, or structural resources available to them. Countries of Eastern Europe and Central Asia are challenged by poor performance as measured by clinical care vignettes, but there is potential for provision of high-quality care by a sizable proportion of providers. Large-scale assessments of quality of care have been hampered by the lack of effective measurement tools that provide generalizable and reliable results across diverse economic, cultural, and social settings. The feasibility of quality measurement using CPV vignettes in these 6 countries and the ability to combine results with individual feedback could significantly enhance strategies to improve quality of care, and ultimately population health. ","433":"Routine health data can guide health systems improvements, but poor quality of these data hinders use. To address concerns about data quality in Malawi, the Ministry of Health and National Statistical Office conducted a data quality assessment (DQA) in July 2016 to identify systems-level factors that could be improved. We used 2-stage stratified random sampling methods to select health centers and hospitals under Ministry of Health auspices, included those managed by faith-based entities, for this DQA. Dispensaries, village clinics, police and military facilities, tertiary-level hospitals, and private facilities were excluded. We reviewed client registers and monthly reports to verify availability, completeness, and accuracy of data in 4 service areas: antenatal care (ANC), family planning, HIV testing and counseling, and acute respiratory infection (ARI). We also conducted interviews with facility and district personnel to assess health management information system (HMIS) functioning and systems-level factors that may be associated with data quality. We compared systems and quality factors by facility characteristics using 2-sample t tests with Welch's approximation, and calculated verification ratios comparing total entries in registers to totals from summarized reports. We selected 16 hospitals (of 113 total in Malawi), 90 health centers (of 466), and 16 district health offices (of 28) in 16 of Malawi's 28 districts. Nearly all registers were available and complete in health centers and district hospitals, but data quality varied across service areas; median verification ratios comparing register and report totals at health centers ranged from 0.78 (interquartile range [IQR]: 0.25, 1.07) for ARI and 0.99 (IQR: 0.82, 1.36) for family planning to 1.00 (IQR: 0.96, 1.00) for HIV testing and counseling and 1.00 (IQR: 0.80, 1.23) for ANC. More than half (60%) of facilities reported receiving a documented supervisory visit for HMIS in the prior 6 months. A recent supervision visit was associated with better availability of data (P=.05), but regular district- or central-level supervision was not. Use of data by the facility to track performance toward targets was associated with both improved availability (P=.04) and completeness of data (P=.02). Half of facilities had a full-time statistical clerk, but their presence did not improve the availability or completeness of data (P=.39 and P=.69, respectively). Findings indicate both strengths and weaknesses in Malawi's HMIS performance, with key weaknesses including infrequent data quality checks and unreliable supervision. Efforts to strengthen HMIS in low- and middle-income countries should be informed by similar assessments. ","434":"Health Surveillance Assistants (HSAs) have been providing integrated community case management (iCCM) for sick children in Malawi since 2008. HSAs report monthly iCCM program data but, at the time of this study, little of it was being used for service improvement. Additionally, HSAs and facility health workers did not have the tools to compile and visualize the data they collected to make evidence-based program decisions. From 2012 to 2013, we worked with Ministry of Health staff and partners to develop and pilot a program in Dowa and Kasungu districts to improve data quality and use at the health worker level. We developed and distributed wall chart templates to display and visualize data, provided training to 426 HSAs and supervisors on data analysis using the templates, and engaged health workers in program improvement plans as part of a data quality and use (DQU) package. We assessed the package through baseline and endline surveys of the HSAs and facility and district staff in the study areas, focusing specifically on availability of reporting forms, completeness of the forms, and consistency of the data between different levels of the health system as measured through results verification ratio (RVR). We found evidence of significant improvements in reporting consistency for suspected pneumonia illness (from overreporting cases at baseline [RVR=0.82] to no reporting inconsistency at endline [RVR=1.0]; P=.02). Other non-significant improvements were measured for fever illness and gender of the patient. Use of the data-display wall charts was high; almost all HSAs and three-fourths of the health facilities had completed all months since January 2013. Some participants reported the wall charts helped them use data for program improvement, such as to inform community health education activities and to better track stock-outs. Since this study, the DQU package has been scaled up in Malawi and expanded to 2 other countries. Unfortunately, without the sustained support and supervision provided in this project, use of the tools in the Malawi scale-up is lower than during the pilot period. Nevertheless, this pilot project shows community and facility health workers can use data to improve programs at the local level given the opportunity to access and visualize the data along with supervision support.","435":"Maternal death surveillance and response (MDSR) constitutes a quality improvement approach to identify how many maternal deaths occur, what the underlying causes of death and associated factors are, and how to implement actions to reduce the number of preventable stillbirths and maternal and neonatal deaths. This requires a coordinated approach, ensuring both national- and district-level stakeholders are enabled and supported and can implement MDSR in a \"no name, no blame\" environment. This field action report from Kenya provides an example of how MDSR can be implemented in a \"real-life\" setting by summarizing the experiences and challenges faced thus far by maternal death assessors and Ministry of Health representatives in implementing MDSR. Strong national leadership via a coordinating secretariat has worked well in Kenya. However, several challenges were encountered including underreporting of data, difficulties with reviewing the data, and suboptimal aggregation of data on cause of death. To ensure progress toward a full national enquiry of all maternal deaths, we recommend improving the notification of maternal deaths, ensuring regular audits and feedback at referral hospitals lead to continuous quality improvement, and strengthening community linkages with health facilities to expedite maternal death reporting. Ultimately, both a top-down and bottom-up approach is needed to ensure success of an MDSR system. Perinatal death surveillance and response is planned as a next phase of MDSR implementation in Kenya. To ensure the process continues to evolve into a full national enquiry of all maternal deaths, we recommend securing longer-term budget allocation and financial commitment from the ministry, securing a national legal framework for MDSR, and improving processes at the subnational level.","436":"","437":"","438":"","439":"In the sixth year of the Syrian conflict, 11 million people have been displaced, including more than 1.1 million seeking refuge in Lebanon. Prior to the crisis, noncommunicable diseases (NCDs) accounted for 80% of all deaths in Syria, and the underlying health behaviors such as tobacco use, obesity, and physical inactivity are still prevalent among Syrian refugees in Lebanon. Humanitarian agencies initially responded to the acute health care needs of refugees by delivering services to informal settlements via mobile medical clinics. As the crisis has become more protracted, humanitarian response plans have shifted their focus to strengthening local health systems in order to better address the needs of both the host and refugee populations. To that end, we identified gaps in care for NCDs and launched a program to deliver chronic disease care for refugees. Based on a participatory needs assessment and community surveys, and building on the success of community health programs in other contexts, we developed a network of 500 refugee outreach volunteers who are supported with training, supervision, and materials to facilitate health promotion and disease control for community members, target NCDs and other priority conditions, and make referrals to a primary health care center for subsidized care. This model demonstrates that volunteer refugee health workers can implement community-based primary health activities in a complex humanitarian emergency.","440":"China has a large migrant population, including many young unmarried women. Little is known about their sexual behavior, contraceptive use, and risk of unintended pregnancy. 475 unmarried female migrants aged 15-24, working in 1 of 6 factories in 2 districts of Changzhou city, completed an anonymous self-administered questionnaire in May 2012 on demographic characteristics, work and living situation, and health. We examined demographic and migration experience predictors of sexual and contraceptive behavior using bivariate and multivariate regressions. 30.1% of the respondents were sexually experienced, with the average age at first sex of 19 years (standard deviation=3). 37.8% reported using contraception at first sex, 58.0% reported using consistent contraception during the past year, and 28.0% reported having at least 1 unintended pregnancy with all unintended pregnancies resulting in abortion. Those who had had at least 1 abortion reported having on average 1.6 abortions [SD=1] in total. Migrating with a boyfriend and changing jobs fewer times were associated with being sexually experienced. Younger age, less education, and changing jobs more times were associated with inconsistent contraceptive use. These findings demonstrate there is an unmet need for reproductive health education and services where these women work as well as in their hometown communities.

This evaluation examined the impact of those 2 key management upgrades approximately 1 year after they were introduced. We used a nonexperimental pre-post study design to compare the previous system with the upgraded management system. We collected baseline data from August to November 2013. We conducted round 1 of post-implementation data collection during April and May 2015, about 1 year after implementation of the upgrades. We evaluated key indicators of data use and reporting; supply chain management practices such as storage and supervision; supply chain performance including stock-out and expiry rates; and supply chain cost and savings. We analyzed the data using a range of techniques including statistical testing of baseline and round-1 results, and cost, cost-effectiveness, and return on investment analysis. The upgrades were associated with improvements in data use, accessibility, visibility, and transparency; planning, control, and monitoring; support for quantification; stock-out rates; stock-out duration; commodity expiry; and forecast error. The upgraded system was more costly, but it was also more efficient, particularly when adjusting for the performance improvements. The upgrades also generated substantial savings that defrayed some, but not all, of the investment costs. Upgrades to Tanzania's supply chain management systems created multiple and complex pathways to impact. One year after implementation, the LMU and eLMIS brought about performance improvements through better data use and through improvements in some, but not all, management practices. Furthermore, the upgrades-while not inexpensive-contributed to greater system efficiency and modest savings. ","442":"Effective community health management information systems (C-HMIS) are important in low-resource countries that rely heavily on community-based health care providers. Zambia currently lacks a functioning C-HMIS to provide real-time, community-based health information from community health workers (CHWs) to health center staff and higher levels of the health system. We developed a C-HMIS mobile platform for use by CHWs providing integrated community case management (iCCM) services and their supervisors to address challenges of frequent stock-outs and inadequate supportive supervision of iCCM-trained CHWs. The platform used simple feature mobile phones on which were loaded the District Health Information System version 2 (DHIS2) software and Java 2 platform micro edition (J2ME) aggregation and tracker applications. This project was implemented in Chipata and Chadiza districts, which supported previous mHealth programs and had cellular coverage from all 3 major network carriers in Zambia. A total of 40 CHWs and 20 CHW supervisors received mobile phones with data bundles and training in the mobile application, after which they implemented the program over a period of 5.5 months, from February to mid-July 2016. CHWs used the mobile phones to submit data on iCCM cases seen, managed, and referred, as well as iCCM medical and diagnostic supplies received and dispensed. Using their mobile phones, the supervisors tracked CHWs' reported cases with medicine consumption, sent CHWs feedback on their referrals, and received SMS reminders to set up mentorship sessions. CHWs were able to use the mobile application to send weekly reports to health center supervisors on disease caseloads and medical commodities consumed, to make drug and supply requisitions, and to send pre-referral notices to health centers. Health center staff used the mobile system to provide feedback to CHWs on the case outcomes of referred patients and to receive automated monthly SMS reminders to invite CHWs to the facility for mentorship. District- and central-level staff were able to access community-level health data in real time using passwords. C-HMIS, using simple feature phones, was feasible and viable for the provision of real-time community-based health information to all levels of the health care system in Zambia, but smartphones, laptops, or desktop computers are needed to perform data analysis and visualization. Ongoing technical support is needed to address the hardware and software challenges CHWs face in their day-to-day interaction with the application on their mobile phones. ","443":"Access to transportation is vital to reducing the travel time to emergency obstetric and neonatal care (EmONC) for managing complications and preventing adverse maternal and neonatal outcomes. This study examines the distribution of travel times to EmONC in Kigoma Region, Tanzania, using various transportation schemes, to estimate the proportion of live births (a proxy indicator of women needing delivery care) with poor geographic access to EmONC services. The 2014 Reproductive Health Survey of Kigoma Region identified 4 primary means of transportation used to travel to health facilities: walking, cycling, motorcycle, and 4-wheeled motor vehicle. A raster-based travel time model was used to map the 2-hour travel time catchment for each mode of transportation. Live birth density distributions were aggregated by travel time catchments, and by administrative council, to estimate the proportion of births with poor access. Of all live births in Kigoma Region, 13% occurred in areas where women can reach EmONC facilities within 2 hours on foot, 33% in areas that can be reached within 2 hours only by motorized vehicles, and 32% where it is impossible to reach EmONC facilities within 2 hours. Over 50% of births in 3 of the 8 administrative councils had poor estimated access. In half the councils, births with poor access could be reduced to no higher than 12% if all female residents had access to motorized vehicles. Significant differences in geographic access to EmONC in Kigoma Region, Tanzania, were observed both by location and by primary transportation type. As most of the population may only have good EmONC access when using mechanized or motorized vehicles, bicycles and motorcycles should be incorporated into the health transportation strategy. Collaboration between private transportation sectors and obstetric service providers could improve access to EmONC services among most populations. In areas where residents may not access EmONC facilities within 2 hours regardless of the type of transportation used, upgrading EmONC capacity among nearby non-EmONC facilities may be required to improve accessibility. ","444":"Countries in Latin America and the Caribbean (LAC) have substantially improved access to family planning over the past 50 years. Many have also recently adopted explicit declarations of universal rights to health and universal health coverage (UHC) and have begun implementing UHC-oriented health financing schemes. These schemes will have important implications for the sustainability and further growth of family planning programs throughout the region. We examined the status of contraceptive methods in major health delivery and financing schemes in 9 LAC countries. Using a set of 37 indicators on family planning coverage, family planning financing, health financing, and family planning inclusion in UHC-oriented schemes, we conducted a desk review of secondary sources, including population surveys, health financing assessments, insurance enrollment reports, and unit cost estimates, and interviewed in-country experts.Findings: Although the modern contraceptive prevalence rate (mCPR) has continued to increase in the majority of LAC countries, substantial disparities in access for marginalized groups remain. On average, mCPR is 20% lower among indigenous women than the general population, 5% lower among uninsured women than insured, and 7% lower among the poorest women than the wealthiest. Among the poorest quintile of women, insured women had an mCPR 16.5 percentage points higher than that of uninsured women, suggesting that expansion of insurance coverage is associated with increased family planning access and use. In the high- and upper-middle-income countries we reviewed, all modern contraceptive methods are typically available through the social health insurance schemes that cover a majority of the population. However, in low- and lower-middle-income countries, despite free provision of most family planning services in public health facilities, stock-outs and implicit rationing present substantial barriers that prevent clients from accessing their preferred method or force them to pay out of pocket. Leveraging UHC-oriented schemes to sustain and further increase family planning progress will require that governments take deliberate steps to (1) target poor and informal sector populations, (2) include family planning in benefits packages, (3) ensure sufficient financing for family planning, and (4) reduce nonfinancial barriers to access. Through these steps, countries can increase financial protection for family planning and better ensure the right to health of poor and marginalized populations. ","445":"The Ebola virus disease (EVD) epidemic that hit West Africa in 2013 was the worst outbreak of EVD in recorded history. While much has been published regarding the international and national-level EVD responses, there is a dearth of literature on district-level coordination and operational structures, successes, and failures. This article seeks to understand how the EVD response unfolded at the district level, namely the challenges to operationalizing EVD surveillance over the course of the outbreak in Port Loko and Kambia districts of Sierra Leone. We present here GOAL Global's understanding of the fundamental challenges to case investigation operations during the EVD response, including environmental and infrastructural, sociocultural, and political and organizational challenges, with insight complemented by a survey of 42 case investigators. Major challenges included deficiencies in transportation and communication resources, low morale and fatigue among case investigators, mismanagement of data, mistrust among communities, and leadership challenges. Without addressing these operational challenges, technical surveillance solutions are difficult to implement and hold limited relevance, due to the poor quality and quantity of data being collected. The low prioritization of operational needs came at a high cost. To mediate this, GOAL addressed these operational challenges by acquiring critical transportation and communication resources to facilitate case investigation, including vehicles, boats, fuel, drivers, phones, and closed user groups; addressing fatigue and low morale by hiring more case investigators, making timely payments, arranging for time off, and providing meals and personal protective equipment; improving data tracking efforts through standard operating procedures, training, and mentorship to build higher-quality case histories and make it easier to access information; strengthening trust in communities by ensuring familiarity and consistency of case investigators; and improving operational leadership challenges through meetings and regular coordination, establishing an active surveillance strategy in Port Loko, and conducting an after-action review. Resolving or addressing these challenges was of primary importance, and requisite for the implementation of technical epidemiological complements to EVD case investigation.","446":"India has 274 million tobacco users and a tobacco use prevalence of 38% in rural areas. Tobacco consumption causes 1 million deaths and costs the health system nearly US$23 billion annually. Tobacco control policies exist but lack proper implementation. In this article, we review the Tobacco-free Village (TfV) program conducted in Maharashtra state in India and describe its process to help villages in rural India achieve \"tobacco-free\" status (i.e., the sale and use of tobacco are prohibited by law). We reviewed program documents and conducted 22 qualitative interviews with program staff and village-level stakeholders. From 2008 to 2014, Salaam Mumbai Foundation implemented the TfV program in 60 villages in Maharashtra state. The program used a number of strategies to help villages become tobacco free, including collaborating with a community-based organization, leveraging existing health workers, conducting a situation analysis, training health workers, engaging stakeholders, developing TfV assessment criteria, mobilizing the community, conducting health education, imposing sanctions, and offering incentives. By 2014, 4 villages had achieved tobacco-free status according to 11 assessment criteria. Successful villages demonstrated strong local leader involvement, ownership of the program, and commitment to the cause by residents. The TfV program faced barriers including poor motivation of health workers, difficulty in changing social norms of tobacco use, and refusal of local vendors to stop tobacco sales due to financial losses. This low-cost, community-driven program holds promise for helping public health practitioners and governments implement and achieve the goals of tobacco control policies, especially in resource-scarce settings.","447":"","448":"Persistent global disparities in maternal and neonatal outcomes and the emergence of compact ultrasound technology as an increasingly viable technology for low-resource settings provided the genesis of the First Look Ultrasound study. Initiated in 2014 in 5 low- and middle-income countries and completed in June 2016, the study's intervention included the training of health personnel to perform antenatal ultrasound screening and to refer women identified with high-risk pregnancies to hospitals for appropriate care. This article examines the challenges that arose in implementing the study, with a particular focus on the site in Equateur Province of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) where the challenges were greatest and the efforts to meet these challenges most illuminating. During the study period, we determined that with resources and dedicated staff, it was possible to leverage the infrastructure and implement ultrasound at antenatal care across a variety of remote sites, including rural DRC. However, numerous technical and logistical challenges had to be addressed including security of the equipment, electricity requirements, and integration of the intervention into the health system. To address security concerns, in most of the countries field sonographers were hired and dispatched each day with the equipment to the health centers. At the end of each day, the equipment was locked in a secure, central location. To obtain the required power source, the DRC health centers installed solar panels bolted on adjacent poles since the thatch roofs of the centers prohibited secure roof-top installation. To realize the full value of the ultrasound intervention, women screened with high-risk pregnancies had to seek a higher level of care at the referral hospital for a definitive diagnosis and appropriate care. While the study did provide guidance on referral and systems management to health center and hospital administration, the extent to which this resulted in the necessary structural changes varied depending on the motivation of the stakeholders. In order for such an intervention to be scaled up and sustained as part of a health system's general services, it would require considerable effort, political will, and financial and human resources. Preliminary results from the study indicate that taking routine antenatal ultrasound screening to scale is not warranted. Lessons learned in implementing the study, however, can help inform future studies or programs that are considering use of ultrasound or other imaging technology for other applications in low-resource settings.","449":"Out-of-pocket payments for health care services lead to decreased use of health services and catastrophic health expenditures. To reduce out-of-pocket payments and improve access to health care services, some countries have introduced community-based health insurance (CBHI) schemes, especially for those in rural communities or who work in the informal sector. However, there has been little focus on equity in access to health care services in CBHI schemes. We searched PubMed, Web of Science, African Journals OnLine, and Africa-Wide Information for studies published in English between 2000 and August 2014 that examined the effect of socioeconomic status on willingness to join and pay for CBHI, actual enrollment, use of health care services, and drop-out from CBHI. Our search yielded 755 articles. After excluding duplicates and articles that did not meet our inclusion criteria (conducted in low- and middle-income countries and involved analysis based on socioeconomic status), 49 articles remained that were included in this review. Data were extracted by one author, and the second author reviewed the extracted data. Disagreements were mutually resolved between the 2 authors. The findings of the studies were analyzed to identify their similarities and differences and to identify any methodological differences that could account for contradictory findings. Generally, the rich were more willing to pay for CBHI than the poor and actual enrollment in CBHI was directly associated with socioeconomic status. Enrollment in CBHI was price-elastic-as premiums decreased, enrollment increased. There were mixed results on the effect of socioeconomic status on use of health care services among those enrolled in CBHI. We found a high drop-out rate from CBHI schemes that was not related to socioeconomic status, although the most common reason for dropping out of CBHI was lack of money to pay the premium. The effectiveness of CBHI schemes in achieving universal health coverage in low- and middle-income countries is questionable. A flexible payment plan where the poor can pay in installments, subsidized premiums for the poor, and removal of co-pays are measures that can increase enrollment and use of CBHI by the poor. ","450":"Mali has one of the world's lowest contraceptive use rates and a high rate of unmet need for family planning. In order to increase access to and choice of quality family planning services, Marie Stopes International (MSI) Mali introduced social franchising in public-sector community health centers (referred to as CSCOMs in Mali) in 3 regions under the MSI brand BlueStar. Potential franchisees are generally identified from CSCOMs who have worked with MSI outreach teams; once accredited as franchisees, CSCOMs receive training, supervision, family planning consumables and commodities, and support for awareness raising and demand creation. To ensure availability and affordability of services, franchisees are committed to providing a wide range of contraceptive methods at low fixed prices. The performance of the BlueStar network from inception in March 2012 until December 2015 was examined using information from routine monitoring data, clinical quality audits, and client exit interviews. During this period, the network grew from 70 to 135 franchisees; an estimated 123,428 clients received voluntary family planning services, most commonly long-acting reversible methods of contraception. Franchisee efficiency and clinical quality of services increased over time, and client satisfaction with services remained high. One-quarter of clients in 2015 were under 20 years old, and three-quarters were adopters of family planning (that is, they had not been using a modern method during the 3 months prior to their visit). Applying a social franchising support package, originally developed for for-profit private-sector providers, to public-sector facilities in Mali has increased access, choice, and use of family planning in 3 regions of Mali. The experience of BlueStar Mali suggests that interventions that support quality supply of services, while simultaneously addressing demand-side barriers such as service pricing, can successfully create demand for a broad range of family planning services, even in settings with low contraceptive prevalence. ","451":"A randomized controlled trial was conducted in 2015 to evaluate a mobile continuing medical education (mCME) intervention that provided daily text messages to community-based physicians' assistants (CBPAs) in Thai Nguyen Province, Vietnam. Although the intervention failed to improve medical knowledge over a 6-month period, a companion qualitative study provided insights on the views and experiences of intervention participants. We conducted focus group discussions (FGDs) and in-depth interviews (IDIs) among participants randomized to receive text messages containing either simple medical facts or quiz questions. Trained interviewers collected data immediately following the conclusion of the trial in December 2015. Using semi-structured question guides, respondents were queried on their views of the intervention, positive and negative, and perceived impacts of the intervention. During analysis, after learning that the intervention had failed to increase knowledge among participants, we also examined reasons for lack of improvement in medical knowledge. All analyses were performed in NVivo using a thematic approach. A total of 70 CBPAs engaged in one of 8 FGDs or an IDI. One-half were men; average age among all respondents was 40 years. Most (81%) practiced in rural settings and most (51%) focused on general medicine. The mean length of work experience was 3 years. All respondents made positive comments about the intervention; convenience, relevance, and quick feedback (quiz format) were praised. Downsides encompassed lack of depth of information, weak interaction, technology challenges, and challenging\/irrelevant messages. Respondents described perceived impacts encompassing increased motivation, knowledge, collegial discussions, Internet use to search for more information, and clinical skills. Overall, they expressed a desire for the intervention to continue and recommended expansion to other medical professionals. Overreliance on the text messages, lack of effective self-study, and technical\/language-based barriers may be potential explanations for intervention failure. As a form of mCME, daily text messages were well-received by community-level health care providers in Vietnam. This mCME approach appears very promising in low-resource environments or where traditional forms of CME are impractical. Future models might consider enhancements to foster linkages to relevant medical materials, improve interaction with medical experts, and tailor medical content to the daily activities of medical staff. ","452":"Shifting childbirth into facilities has not improved health outcomes for mothers and newborns as significantly as hoped. Improving the quality and safety of care provided during facility-based childbirth requires helping providers to adhere to essential birth practices-evidence-based behaviors that reduce harm to and save lives of mothers and newborns. To achieve this goal, we developed the BetterBirth Program, which we tested in a matched-pair, cluster-randomized controlled trial in Uttar Pradesh, India. The goal of this intervention was to improve adoption and sustained use of the World Health Organization Safe Childbirth Checklist (SCC), an organized collection of 28 essential birth practices that are known to improve the quality of facility-based childbirth care. Here, we describe the BetterBirth Program in detail, including its 4 main features: implementation tools, an implementation strategy of coaching, an implementation pathway (Engage-Launch-Support), and a sustainability plan. This coaching-based implementation of the SCC motivates and empowers care providers to identify, understand, and resolve the barriers they face in using the SCC with the resources already available. We describe important lessons learned from our experience with the BetterBirth Program as it was tested in the BetterBirth Trial. For example, the emphasis on relationship building and respect led to trust between coaches and birth attendants and helped influence change. In addition, the cloud-based data collection and feedback system proved a valuable asset in the coaching process. More research on coaching-based interventions is required to refine our understanding of what works best to improve quality and safety of care in various settings.Note: At the time of publication of this article, the results of evaluation of the impact of the BetterBirth Program were pending publication in another journal. After the impact findings have been published, we will update this article with a reference to the impact findings.","453":"Adherence to evidence-based essential birth practices is critical for improving health outcomes for mothers and newborns. The WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist (SCC) incorporates these practices, which occur during 4 critical pause points: on admission, before pushing (or cesarean delivery), soon after birth, and before discharge. A peer-coaching strategy to support consistent use of the SCC may be an effective approach to increase birth attendants' adherence to these practices. We assessed data from 60 public health facilities in Uttar Pradesh, India, that received an 8-month staggered coaching intervention from December 2014 to September 2016 as part of the BetterBirth Trial, which is studying effectiveness of an SCC-centered intervention on maternal and neonatal harm. Nurse coaches recorded birth attendants' adherence to 39 essential birth practices. Practice adherence was calculated for each intervention month. After 2 months of coaching, a subsample of 15 facilities was selected for independent observation when the coach was not present. We compared adherence to the 18 practices recorded by both coaches and independent observers. Coaches observed birth attendants' behavior during 5,971 deliveries. By the final month of the intervention, 35 of 39 essential birth practices had achieved &gt;90% adherence in the presence of a coach, compared with only 7 of 39 practices during the first month. Key behaviors with the greatest improvement included explanation of danger signs, temperature measurement, assessment of fetal heart sounds, initiation of skin-to-skin contact, and breastfeeding. Without a coach present, birth attendants' average adherence to practices and checklist use was 24 percentage points lower than when a coach was present (range: -1% to 62%). Implementation of the WHO Safe Childbirth Checklist with coaching improved uptake of and adherence to essential birth practices. Coordination and communication among facility staff, as well as behaviors with an immediate, tangible benefit, showed the greatest improvement. Difficult-to-perform behaviors and those with delayed or theoretical benefits were less likely to be sustained without a coach present. Coaching may be an important component in implementing the Safe Childbirth Checklist at scale.Note: At the time of publication of this article, the results of evaluation of the impact of the BetterBirth intervention were pending publication in another journal. After the impact findings have been published, we will update this article on the effect of the intervention on birth practices with a reference to the impact findings.

This study evaluated newborn infection treatment at the most peripheral level of the health system in rural Ethiopia. We performed a cluster-randomized trial in 22 geographical clusters (11 allocated to intervention, 11 to control). In both arms, volunteers and government-employed Health Extension Workers (HEWs) conducted home visits to pregnant and newly delivered mothers; assessed newborns; and counseled caregivers on prevention of newborn illness, danger signs, and care seeking. Volunteers referred sick newborns to health posts for further assessment; HEWs referred newborns with PSBI signs to health centers. In the intervention arm only, between July 2011 and June 2013, HEWs treated newborns with PSBI with intramuscular gentamicin and oral amoxicillin for 7 days at health posts when referral to health centers was not possible or acceptable to caregivers. Intervention communities were informed of treatment availability at health posts to encourage care seeking. Masking was not feasible. The primary outcome was all-cause mortality of newborns 2-27 days after birth, measured by household survey data. Baseline data were collected between June 2008 and May 2009; endline data, between February 2013 and June 2013. We sought to detect a 33% mortality reduction. Analysis was by intention to treat. (ClinicalTrials.gov registry: NCT00743691). Of 1,011 sick newborns presenting at intervention health posts, 576 (57%) were identified by HEWs as having at least 1 PSBI sign; 90% refused referral and were treated at the health post, with at least 79% completing the antibiotic regimen. Estimated treatment coverage at health posts was in the region of 50%. Post-day 1 neonatal mortality declined more in the intervention arm (17.9 deaths per 1,000 live births at baseline vs. 9.4 per 1,000 at endline) than the comparison arm (14.4 per 1,000 vs. 11.2 per 1,000, respectively). After adjusting for baseline mortality and region, the estimated post-day 1 mortality risk ratio was 0.83, but the result was not statistically significant (95% confidence interval, 0.55 to 1.24; P=.33). When referral to higher levels of care is not possible, HEWs can deliver outpatient antibiotic treatment of newborns with PSBI, but estimated treatment coverage in a rural Ethiopian setting was only around 50%. While our data suggest a mortality reduction consistent with that which might be expected at this level of coverage, they do not provide conclusive results. ","460":"","461":"To determine the availability and quality of family planning services within health facilities throughout the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Data were collected for the cross-sectional study from April 2014 to June 2014 by the Ministry of Public Health. A total of 1,568 health facilities that reported data to the National Health Information System were selected by multistage random sampling in the 11 provinces of the DRC existing at that time. Data were collected through interviews, document review, and direct observation. Two dependent variables were measured: availability of family planning services (consisting of a room for services, staff assigned to family planning, and evidence of client use of family planning) and quality of family planning services (assessed as \"high\" if the facility had at least 1 trained staff member, family planning service delivery guidelines, at least 3 types of methods, and a sphygmomanometer, or \"low\" if the facility did not meet any of these 4 criteria). Pearson's chi-square test and odds ratios (ORs) were used to test for significant associations, using the alpha significance level of .05. We successfully surveyed 1,555 facilities (99.2%) of those included in the sample. One in every 3 facilities (33%) offered family planning services as assessed by the index of availability, of which 20% met all 4 criteria for providing high-quality services. Availability was greatest at the highest level of the health system (hospitals) and decreased incrementally with each health system level, with disparities between provinces and urban and rural areas. Facilities in urban areas were more likely than in rural areas to meet the standard for high-quality services (P&lt;.001). Public facilities were less likely than private facilities to have high-quality services (P=.02). Among all 1,555 facilities surveyed, 14% had at least 3 types of methods available at the time of the survey; the most widely available methods were male condoms, combined oral contraceptive pills, and progestin-only injectable contraceptives. Availability and quality of family planning services in health facilities in the DRC remain low, with inequitable distribution of services throughout the country. To improve access to and use of family planning, efforts should focus on improving availability and quality at lower health system levels and in rural areas where the majority of the population lives. ","462":"Understanding the barriers that women in Haiti face to giving birth at a health facility is important for improving coverage of facility delivery and reducing persistently high maternal mortality. We linked health facility survey data and population survey data to assess the role of the obstetric service environment in affecting women's use of facility delivery care. Data came from the 2012 Haiti Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) and the 2013 Haiti Service Provision Assessment (SPA) survey. DHS clusters and SPA facilities were linked with their geographic coordinate information. The final analysis sample from the DHS comprised 4,921 women who had a live birth in the 5 years preceding the survey. Service availability was measured with the number of facilities providing delivery services within a specified distance from the cluster (within 5 kilometers for urban areas and 10 kilometers for rural areas). We measured facility readiness to provide obstetric care using 37 indicators defined by the World Health Organization. Random-intercept logistic regressions were used to model the variation in individual use of facility-based delivery care and cluster-level service availability and readiness, adjusting for other factors. Overall, 39% of women delivered their most recent birth at a health facility and 61% delivered at home, with disparities by residence (about 60% delivered at a health facility in urban areas vs. 24% in rural areas). About one-fifth (18%) of women in rural areas and one-tenth (12%) of women in nonmetropolitan urban areas lived in clusters where no facility offered delivery care within the specified distances, while nearly all women (99%) in the metropolitan area lived in clusters that had at least 2 such facilities. Urban clusters had better service readiness compared with rural clusters, with a wide range of variation in both areas. Regression models indicated that in both rural and nonmetropolitan urban areas availability of delivery services was significantly associated with women's greater likelihood of using facility-based delivery care after controlling for other covariates, while facilities' readiness to provide delivery services was also important in nonmetropolitan urban areas. Increasing physical access to delivery care should become a high priority in rural Haiti. In urban areas, where delivery services are more available than in rural areas, improving quality of care at facilities could potentially lead to increased coverage of facility delivery. ","463":"","464":"The American Mock World Health Organization (AMWHO) is a model for experiential-based learning and student engagement in global health diplomacy. AMWHO was established in 2014 at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill with a mission to engage students in health policy by providing a simulation of the World Health Assembly (WHA), the policy-forming body of the World Health Organization that sets norms and transforms the global health agenda. AMWHO conferences are designed to allow students to take their knowledge of global health beyond the classroom and practice their skills in diplomacy by assuming the role of WHA delegates throughout a 3-day weekend. Through the process of developing resolutions like those formed in the WHA, students have the unique opportunity to understand the complexities behind the conflict and compromise that ensues through the lens of a stakeholder. This article describes the structure of the first 2 AMWHO international conferences, analyzes survey results from attendees, and discusses the expansion of the organization into a multi-campus national network. The AMWHO 2014 and 2015 post-conference survey results found that 98% and 90% of participants considered the conference \"good\" or \"better,\" respectively, and survey responses showed that participants considered the conference \"influential\" in their careers and indicated that it \"allowed a paradigm shift not possible in class.\"","465":"In recent years there has been a surge in the number of global health programs operated by academic institutions. However, most of the existing programs describe partnerships that are primarily faculty-driven and supported by extramural funding. Research and Advocacy for Health in India (RAHI, or \"pathfinder\" in Hindi) and Support and Action Towards Health-Equity in India (SATHI, or \"partnership\" in Hindi) are 2 interconnected, collaborative efforts between the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) and Charutar Arogya Mandal (CAM), a medical college and a tertiary care center in rural western India. The RAHI-SATHI program is the culmination of a series of student\/trainee-led research and capacity strengthening initiatives that received institutional support in the form of faculty mentorship and seed funding. RAHI-SATHI's trainee-led twinning approach overcomes traditional barriers faced by global health programs. Trainees help mitigate geographical barriers by acting as a bridge between members from different institutions, garner cultural insight through their ability to immerse themselves in a community, and overcome expertise limitations through pre-planned structured mentorship from faculty of both institutions. Trainees play a central role in cultivating trust among the team members and, in the process, they acquire personal leadership skills that may benefit them in their future careers. This paradigm of trainee-led twinning partnership promotes sustainability in an uncertain funding climate and provides a roadmap for conducting foundational work that is essential for the development of a broad, university-wide global health program. ","466":"Digital health development and use has been expansive and operationalized in a variety of settings and modalities around the world, including in low- and middle-income countries. Mobile applications have been developed for a variety of health professionals and frontline health workers including physicians, midwives, nurses, and community health workers. However, there are no published studies on the development and use of digital health related to human rights fieldwork and to our knowledge no mobile health platforms exist specifically for use by frontline health workers to forensically and clinically document sexual violence. We describe a participatory development and user design process with Congolese end-users of a novel human rights app for clinicians intended to standardize the documentation of sexual violence evidence for forensic and legal purposes, called MediCapt. The app, yet to be launched and still in the future proofing phase, has included several development phases: (1) initial needs assessment conducted in 2011, (2) prototype development and field-testing in 2014 with 8 Congolese physicians, (3) prototype refinement and field-testing in 2015 with 9 clinicians. Feedback from the first field-testing phase was incorporated into the design of the second prototype; key features that were added to MediCapt include the ability for users to take photographs and draw on a pictogram to include as part of the evidence package, as well as the ability to print a form with the completed data. Questionnaires and key-informant interviews during the second and third field-testing phases revealed overall positive attitudes about MediCapt, but multiple perceived and actual barriers to implementation were identified, from personal behaviors, such as individual clinicians' comfort with new technology, to more systemic and infrastructure factors, such as strong cultural preferences for print documentation of evidence and limited Internet connectivity. Next phases of development include consideration of patients' acceptance of this technology, how it actually fits in the clinical workflow, and testing of how to transfer the collected evidence to law enforcement and legal authorities. Ultimately, we plan on conducting a robust evaluation to assess effectiveness of the app on medical, legal, and human rights outcomes. We believe our experience of collecting data that will potentially serve as legal evidence broadens the traditional scope of digital health and crosses a wide range of fields including medical, technological, legal, and ethical, and thus propose refining and defining this unique field of exploration as mobile justice, or mJustice.","467":"Violence against and among children is a global public health problem that annually affects 50% of youth worldwide with major impacts on child development, education, and health including increased probability of major causes of morbidity and mortality in adulthood. It is also associated with the experience of and perpetration of later violence against women. The aim of this article is to describe the intervention, study design, methods, and baseline findings of a cluster randomized controlled trial underway in Pakistan to evaluate a school-based play intervention aiming to reduce peer violence and enhance mental health. A cluster randomized controlled design is being conducted with boys and girls in grade 6 in 40 schools in Hyderabad, Pakistan, over a period of 2 years. The Multidimensional Peer-Victimization and Peer Perpetration Scales and the Children's Depression Inventory 2 (CDI 2) are being used to measure the primary outcomes while investigator-derived scales are being used to assess domestic violence within the family. Specifics of the intervention, field logistics, ethical, and fidelity management issues employed to test the program's impact on school age youth in a volatile and politically unstable country form this report. A total of 1,752 school-age youth were enrolled and interviewed at baseline. Over the preceding 4 weeks, 94% of the boys and 85% of the girls reported 1 or more occurrences of victimization, and 85% of the boys and 66% of the girls reported 1 or more acts of perpetration. Boys reported more depression compared with girls, as well as higher negative mood and self-esteem scores and more interpersonal and emotional problems. Globally, prevalence of youth violence perpetration and victimization is high and associated with poor physical and emotional health. Applying a randomized controlled design to evaluate a peer violence prevention program built on a firm infrastructure and that is ready for scale-up and sustainability will make an important contribution to identifying evidence-informed interventions that can reduce youth victimization and perpetration. ","468":"Gas-based cryotherapy is the most widely used treatment strategy for cervical intraepithelial neoplasia (CIN) in low-resource settings, but reliance on gas presents challenges in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). Our team adapted the original CryoPen Cryosurgical System, a cryotherapy device that does not require compressed gas and is powered by electricity, for use in LMICs. A mixed-methods approach was used involving both qualitative and quantitative methods. First, we used a user-centered design approach to identify priority features of the adapted device. U.S.-based and global potential users of the adapted CryoPen participated in discussion groups and a card sorting activity to rank 7 features of the adapted CryoPen: cost, durability, efficacy and safety, maintenance, no need for electricity, patient throughput, and portability. Mean and median rankings, overall rankings, and summary rankings by discussion group were generated. In addition, results of several quantitative tests were analyzed including bench testing to determine tip temperature and heat extraction capabilities; a pathology review of CIN grade 3 cases (N=107) to determine target depth of necrosis needed to achieve high efficacy; and a pilot study (N=5) investigating depth of necrosis achieved with the adapted device to assess efficacy. Discussion groups revealed 4 priority themes for device development in addition to the need to ensure high efficacy and safety and low cost: improved portability, durability, ease of use, and potential for cure. Adaptions to the original CryoPen system included a single-core, single-tip model; rugged carrying case; custom circuit to allow car battery charging; and sterilization by high-level disinfection. In bench testing, there were no significant differences in tip temperature or heat extraction capability between the adapted CryoPen and the standard cryotherapy device. In 80% of the cases in the pilot study, the adapted CryoPen achieved the target depth of necrosis 3.5 mm established in the pathology review. The LMIC-adapted CryoPen overcomes barriers to standard gas-based cryotherapy by eliminating dependency on gas, increasing portability, and ensuring consistent freeze temperatures. Further testing and evaluation of the adapted CryoPen will be pursued to assess scalability and potential impact of this device in decreasing the cervical cancer burden in LMICs.

An exploratory scoping methodology was used to characterize the full range of quality components in 32 PBF programs, initiated between 2008 and 2015 in 28 low- and middle-income countries, totaling 68 quality tools and 8,490 quality indicators. The programs were identified through a review of the peer-reviewed and gray literature as well as through expert consultation with key donor representatives. Most of the PBF programs were implemented in sub-Saharan Africa and most were funded primarily by the World Bank. On average, PBF quality tools contained 125 indicators predominately assessing maternal, newborn, and child health and facility management and infrastructure. Indicators were primarily measured via checklists (78%, or 6,656 of 8,490 indicators), which largely (over 90%) measured structural aspects of quality, such as equipment, beds, and infrastructure. Of the most common indicators across checklists, 74% measured structural aspects and 24% measured processes of clinical care. The quality portion of the payment formulas were in the form of bonuses (59%), penalties (27%), or both (hybrid) (14%). The median percentage (of a performance payment) allocated to health facilities was 60%, ranging from 10% to 100%, while the median percentage allocated to health care providers was 55%, ranging from 20% to 80%. Nearly all of the programs included in the analysis (91%, n=29) verified quality scores quarterly (every 3 months), typically by regional government teams. PBF is a potentially appealing instrument to address shortfalls in quality of care by linking verified performance measurement with strategic incentives and could ultimately help meet policy priorities at the country and global levels, including the ambitious Sustainable Development Goals. The substantial variation and complexity in how PBF programs incorporate quality of care considerations suggests a need to further examine whether differences in design are associated with differential program impacts. ","475":"Ethiopia has made notable progress in increasing awareness and knowledge of family planning and is considered a success story among funders and program planners. Yet unmet need among rural women (28.6%) is almost double that of urban women (15.5%), with a wide gap in total fertility rate depending on urban (2.6) or rural (5.5) residence. This study investigates the impact of a service delivery model that combines community-based distribution (CBD) of contraception with social marketing in Tigray, Ethiopia, to create a more sustainable approach to CBD. Between September 2011 and October 2013, 626 volunteer CHWs were recruited and trained to administer depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) injections and provide counseling and referrals to the health post for other methods; the project implementation period ended in June 2014. The CHWs received a supply of DMPA injections in the form of a microloan from a drug revolving fund; the CHWs charged women a minimal fee (5 birr, or US$0.29), determined based on willingness-to-pay data, for each DMPA injection; and the CHWs returned part of the fee (3 birr) to the drug revolving fund while keeping the remaining portion (2 birr). The CHWs also promoted demand for family planning through door-to-door outreach and community meetings. Existing health extension workers (HEWs) provided regular supervision of the CHWs, supplemented by in-depth supervision visits from study coordinators. Baseline and endline representative surveys of women of reproductive age, as well as of participating CHWs, were conducted. In addition, DMPA provision data from the CHWs were collected. Between October 2011 and June 2014, the CHWs served in total 8,604 women and administered an estimated 15,410 DMPA injections, equivalent to providing 3,853 couple-years of protection. There was a 25% significant increase in contraceptive use among surveyed women, from 30.1% at baseline to 37.7% at endline, with DMPA use largely responsible for this increase. Changes in quality of family planning markers from baseline suggested services improved between baseline and endline: nearly 50% more women reported being told about side effects and what to do if they experience side effects, and 25% more women said they were told about other methods of contraception. The results from household surveys at baseline and endline suggest that CHWs in this model made a significant contribution to family planning in the region.","476":"Young people often express a preference for seeking family planning information and services from the private sector. However, in many Marie Stopes International (MSI) social franchise networks, the proportion of young clients, and particularly those under 20 years of age, remains low. Marie Stopes Madagascar (MSM) piloted a youth voucher program that joins a supply-side intervention-youth-friendly social franchisee training and quality monitoring-with a corresponding demand-side-component, free vouchers that reduce financial barriers to family planning access for young people. Young people identified by MSM's community health educators (CHEs) received a free voucher redeemable at a BlueStar social franchisee for a package of voluntary family planning and sexually transmitted infection (STI) information and services. BlueStar social franchisees-private providers accredited by MSM-are reimbursed for the cost of providing these services. We reviewed service statistics data from the first 18 months of the youth voucher program, from July 2013 to December 2014, as well as client demographic profile data from July 2015.Findings: Between July 2013 and December 2014, 58,417 vouchers were distributed to young people by CHEs through a range of community mobilization efforts, of which 43,352 (74%) were redeemed for family planning and STI services. Most clients (78.5%) chose a long-acting reversible contraceptive (LARC), and just over half (51%) of young people benefited from STI counseling as part of their voucher service. Most (78%) services were provided in the Analamanga region (the capital and its surroundings), which was expected given the population density in this region and the high concentration of BlueStar franchisees. The client profile data snapshot from July 2015 revealed that 69% of voucher clients had never previously used a contraceptive method, and 96% of clients were aged 20 or younger, suggesting that the voucher program is successfully reaching the intended target group. MSM's youth voucher program has revealed a high demand for voluntary family planning services, especially among youth under 20 years old, and MSM has since integrated the youth voucher beyond the initial pilot locations. MSM's experience indicates that youth vouchers are a novel and effective means of increasing young people's access to voluntary family planning services in Madagascar, and this model could potentially be replicated or adapted in other contexts where young people are faced with barriers to accessing quality information and services. ","477":"In Angola, many women want to use family planning but lack access to affordable and preferred methods. This article assesses the link between women's choice and availability of contraceptive methods in Luanda, Angola, drawing on data from 3 surveys: a 2012 survey among women ages 15-49 and 2 retail surveys conducted in 2014 and 2015 among outlets and facilities offering contraceptive methods. Descriptive statistics for women's contraceptive knowledge, use, and preferred methods were stratified by age group. We report the percentage of establishments offering different methods and brands of modern contraception, and the mean price, volume of units sold, and value (Angolan Kwanzas) for each brand. Data from the 2 retail surveys are compared to measure changes in availability over time. Results show that 51% of women reported having an unwanted pregnancy. Less than 40% of women knew about long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs). Overall, the method most commonly used was male condoms (32.1%), with a substantial proportion (17.3%) of women not using their preferred contraceptive. Trends in contraceptive use mirror availability: in 2015, condoms were available in 73.6% of outlets\/facilities, while LARC methods were available in less than 10%. The availability of different methods also dropped significantly between 2014 and 2015-by up to 15 percentage points-with a subsequent price increase in many brands. To meet women's needs for contraception and make informed choice possible, Angola should reinforce demand creation and contraceptive supply in both the public and private sectors through behavior change programs aimed at both women and providers, improved quality of services, training of health personnel on method options and delivery, and improved supply chain distribution of contraceptives. This will allow women to find the methods and brands that best suit their needs, preferences, and ability to pay.","478":"Concern about contraceptive side effects is a common reason reported by women for not using contraception or discontinuing use. We sought to characterize women's preferences related to method characteristics and side effects and to examine whether their adopted method was consistent with their stated preferences. Between June 1, 2015, and August 31, 2015, we surveyed women attending 5 urban family planning clinics in Kumasi and Accra, Ghana, before and after their counseling sessions. All women attending these clinics were approached to gauge their interest and eligibility for inclusion. Before counseling, women were asked about desired method characteristics and bothersome and intolerable side effects. After counseling, women were asked about method adoption and the counseling received about side effects. We then used crosstabs to compare the side effects women were counseled to expect, as well as those they reported would be intolerable, with their adopted methods to determine consistency between women's preferences and choices. In total, 414 and 411 women completed the pre- and post-counseling surveys, respectively. The analysis sample consisted of 336 participants who adopted a method and were matched between the 2 surveys. The 3 most commonly chosen methods were the implant (n=135, 40.1%), injectables (n=109, 32.4%), and the intrauterine device (IUD) (n=52, 13.4%). The large majority (at least 87%) of method adopters chose a method that was well matched with their desired duration of effectiveness. Consistency between women's expressed intolerable side effects and their chosen methods was substantially lower: at least 70% of women choosing the implant, IUD, or injectables had stated they would stop using a method if they experienced those side effects that are in fact common with their respectively chosen methods. While 65.0% of those who adopted a method reported they were counseled to expect side effects, substantially less were counseled to expect the side effects common with use of their adopted method. Women's choice of contraceptive methods generally matched their stated preferences related to desired duration of effectiveness but not to potential side effects, and most women reported they were not counseled to expect the side effects common with use of their chosen method. Providers need to address potential side effects during counseling both to ensure women choose methods that will be a good fit with their desires and to reassure them that commonly experienced side effects are not harmful. ","479":"The use of simulated clients or \"mystery clients\" is a data collection approach in which a study team member presents at a health care facility or outlet pretending to be a real customer, patient, or client. Following the visit, the shopper records her observations. The use of mystery clients can overcome challenges of obtaining accurate measures of health care quality and improve the validity of quality assessments, particularly in low- and middle-income countries. However, mystery client studies should be carefully designed and monitored to avoid problems inherent to this data collection approach. In this article, we discuss our experiences with the mystery client methodology in studies conducted in public- and private-sector health facilities in Kenya and in private-sector facilities in Uganda. We identify both the benefits and the challenges in using this methodology to guide other researchers interested in using this technique. Recruitment of appropriate mystery clients who accurately represent the facility's clientele, have strong recall of recent events, and are comfortable in their role as undercover data collectors are key to successful implementation of this methodology. Additionally, developing detailed training protocols can help ensure mystery clients behave identically and mimic real patrons accurately while short checklists can help ensure mystery client responses are standardized. Strict confidentiality and protocols to avoid unnecessary exams or procedures should also be stressed during training and monitored carefully throughout the study. Despite these challenges, researchers should consider mystery client designs to measure actual provider behavior and to supplement self-reported provider behavior. Data from mystery client studies can provide critical insight into the quality of service provision unavailable from other data collection methods. The unique information available from the mystery client approach far outweighs the cost.","480":"","481":"","482":"Maximizing the benefits of community health worker (CHW) programs requires strategies for improving motivation, performance, and retention. Discrete choice experiments (DCE) are increasingly used to inform policy response to health workforce shortages in rural areas, and may be of value in the context of CHW programs. Participants are presented with pairs of hypothetical jobs that are described by job attributes with varying levels and are asked what their preferred job is within each pair. Responses are then analyzed quantitatively to obtain information on what attributes are important to participants. We conducted a qualitative assessment to examine the appropriateness and validity of applying a DCE to a new population of CHWs with lower literacy. In 2011, we conducted a mixed-method study with CHWs in Uganda, consisting of 183 surveys and 43 in-depth interviews (IDIs). The DCE was administered to both survey and IDI participants. This article reports on the qualitative assessment of the implementation of the DCE. We compare DCE responses between survey and IDI participants to determine whether administering the DCE in a qualitative (IDI) context altered responses. We then present additional information collected on CHWs' decision-making processes and their experiences with the DCE in the IDIs. Choices made by IDI participants were consistent with the choices made by survey participants. In-depth exploration of CHWs' observations in answering the DCE suggest that, overall, CHWs comprehended the DCE exercise and made reasoned choices. However, the data revealed some level of cognitive difficulty and highlighted some design and implementation challenges that are important to consider, particularly when applying a DCE to populations with lower literacy. These include the need to keep the number of attributes small; to choose levels that are realistic yet show sufficient range; and to clearly define attributes and their levels. DCEs can be an appropriate approach with CHWs but require careful design and implementation. ","483":"High quality is important in medical imaging, yet in many geographic areas, highly skilled sonographers are in short supply. Advances in Internet capacity along with the development of reliable portable ultrasounds have created an opportunity to provide centralized remote quality assurance (QA) for ultrasound exams performed at rural sites worldwide. We sought to harness these advances by developing a web-based tool to facilitate QA activities for newly trained sonographers who were taking part in a cluster randomized trial investigating the role of limited obstetric ultrasound to improve pregnancy outcomes in 5 low- and middle-income countries. We were challenged by connectivity issues, by country-specific needs for website usability, and by the overall need for a high-throughput system. After systematically addressing these needs, the resulting QA website helped drive ultrasound quality improvement across all 5 countries. It now offers the potential for adoption by future ultrasound- or imaging-based global health initiatives.","484":"Implementing complex nutrition and other public health projects and tracking nutrition interventions, such as women's diet and supplementation and infant and young child feeding practices, requires reliable routine data to identify potential program gaps and to monitor trends in behaviors in real time. However, current monitoring and evaluation practices generally do not create an environment for this real-time tracking. This article describes the development and application of a mobile-based nutrition and health monitoring system, which collected monitoring data on project activities, women's nutrition, and infant and young child feeding practices in real time. The Liberia Agricultural Upgrading Nutrition and Child Health (LAUNCH) project implemented a nutrition and health monitoring system between April 2012 and June 2014. The LAUNCH project analyzed project monitoring and outcome data from the system and shared selected behavioral and programmatic indicators with program managers through a short report, which later evolved into a visual data dashboard, during program-update meetings. The project designed protocols to ensure representativeness of program participants. LAUNCH made programmatic adjustments in response to findings from the monitoring system; these changes were then reflected in subsequent quarterly trends, indicating that the availability of timely data allowed for the project to react quickly to issues and adapt the program appropriately. Such issues included lack of participation in community groups and insufficient numbers of food distribution points. Likewise, the system captured trends in key outcome indicators such as breastfeeding and complementary feeding practices, linking them to project activities and external factors including seasonal changes and national health campaigns. Digital data collection platforms can play a vital role in improving routine programmatic functions. Fixed gathering locations such as food distribution points represent an opportunity to easily access program participants and enable managers to identify strengths and weaknesses in project implementation. For programs that track individuals over time, a mobile tool combined with a strong database can greatly improve efficiency and data visibility and reduce resource leakages. ","485":"Vasectomy is a highly effective and safe contraceptive method for couples who want to stop childbearing, but only 2.4% of men around the world use this method. We conducted an extensive review of the vasectomy research literature and programmatic reports, published between April 2005 and April 2015, to synthesize barriers and facilitators to vasectomy adoption. Of the more than 230 documents initially retrieved in our search, we ultimately included 75 documents in our review and synthesized the findings according to the Supply-Enabling Environment-Demand (SEED) Programming Model. Regarding promoting demand for vasectomy services, we found there was a general lack of awareness about the method among both men and women, which often fueled erroneous assumptions about how vasectomy affects men. Several types of programmatic activities directly addressed knowledge gaps and negative misperceptions, including community-based and mass media communications, employer-based promotion, and group counseling. For supply of services, the lack of or inaccurate knowledge about vasectomy was also prevalent among providers, particularly among community-based health workers. Programmatic activities to improve service delivery included the use of evidence-based vasectomy techniques such as no-scalpel vasectomy, whole-site trainings, task shifting, cascade training, and mobile outreach. Finally, programmatic approaches to building a more enabling environment included engagement of governments and other community and religious leaders as well as campaigns with gender transformative messaging that countered common myths and encouraged men's positive engagement in family planning and reproductive health. In summary, a successful vasectomy program is comprised of the mutually reinforcing components of continual demand for services and access to and supply of well-trained providers. In addition, there is an underlying need for enabling policies within the cultural and gender environments that extend beyond vasectomy and include men not just as default partners of female family planning clients but as equal beneficiaries of family planning and reproductive health programs in their own right. Accelerating progress toward meaningful integration of vasectomy into a comprehensive contraceptive method mix is only possible when political and financial will are aligned and support the logistical and promotional activities of a male reproductive health agenda.","486":"Following the World Health Organization (WHO) declaration of a Public Health Emergency of International Concern regarding the Ebola outbreak in West Africa in July 2014, UNICEF was asked to co-lead, in coordination with WHO and the ministries of health of affected countries, the communication and social mobilization component-which UNICEF refers to as communication for development (C4D)-of the Ebola response. For the first time in an emergency setting, C4D was formally incorporated into each country's national response, alongside more typical components such as supplies and logistics, surveillance, and clinical care. This article describes the lessons learned about social mobilization and community engagement in the emergency response to the Ebola outbreak, with a particular focus on UNICEF's C4D work in Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. The lessons emerged through an assessment conducted by UNICEF using 4 methods: a literature review of key documents, meeting reports, and other articles; structured discussions conducted in June 2015 and October 2015 with UNICEF and civil society experts; an electronic survey, launched in October and November 2015, with staff from government, the UN, or any partner organization who worked on Ebola (N = 53); and key informant interviews (N = 5). After triangulating the findings from all data sources, we distilled lessons under 7 major domains: (1) strategy and decentralization: develop a comprehensive C4D strategy with communities at the center and decentralized programming to facilitate flexibility and adaptation to the local context; (2) coordination: establish C4D leadership with the necessary authority to coordinate between partners and enforce use of standard operating procedures as a central coordination and quality assurance tool; (3) entering and engaging communities: invest in key communication channels (such as radio) and trusted local community members; (4) messaging: adapt messages and strategies continually as patterns of the epidemic change over time; (5) partnerships: invest in strategic partnerships with community, religious leaders, journalists, radio stations, and partner organizations; (6) capacity building: support a network of local and international professionals with capacity for C4D who can be deployed rapidly; (7) data and performance monitoring: establish clear C4D process and impact indicators and strive for real-time data analysis and rapid feedback to communities and authorities to inform decision making. Ultimately, communication, community engagement, and social mobilization need to be formally placed within the global humanitarian response architecture with proper funding to effectively support future public health emergencies, which are as much a social as a health phenomenon.","487":"Supporting the diverse needs of people living with HIV (PLHIV) can help reduce the individual and structural barriers they face in adhering to antiretroviral treatment (ART). The Livelihoods and Food Security Technical Assistance II (LIFT) project sought to improve adherence in Malawi by establishing 2 referral systems linking community-based economic strengthening and livelihoods services to clinical health facilities. One referral system in Balaka district, started in October 2013, connected clients to more than 20 types of services while the other simplified approach in Kasungu and Lilongwe districts, started in July 2014, connected PLHIV attending HIV and nutrition support facilities directly to community savings groups. From June to July 2015, LIFT visited referral sites in Balaka, Kasungu, and Lilongwe districts to collect qualitative data on referral utility, the perceived association of referrals with client and household health and vulnerability, and the added value of the referral system as perceived by network member providers. We interviewed a random sample of 152 adult clients (60 from Balaka, 57 from Kasungu, and 35 from Lilongwe) who had completed their referral. We also conducted 2 focus group discussions per district with network providers. Clients in all 3 districts indicated their ability to save money had improved after receiving a referral, although the percentage was higher among clients in the simplified Kasungu and Lilongwe model than the more complex Balaka model (85.6% vs. 56.0%, respectively). Nearly 70% of all clients interviewed had HIV infection; 72.7% of PLHIV in Balaka and 95.7% of PLHIV in Kasungu and Lilongwe credited referrals for helping them stay on their ART. After the referral, 76.0% of clients in Balaka and 92.3% of clients in Kasungu and Lilongwe indicated they would be willing to spend their savings on health costs. The more diverse referral network and use of an mHealth app to manage data in Balaka hindered provider uptake of the system, while the simpler system in Kasungu and Lilongwe, which included only 2 referral options and use of a paper-based referral tool, seemed simpler for the providers to manage. Participation in the referral systems was perceived positively by clients and providers in both models, but more so in Kasungu and Lilongwe where the referral process was simpler. Future referral networks should consider limiting the number of service options included in the network and simplify referral tools to the extent possible to facilitate uptake among network providers. ","488":"The Family Planning 2020 initiative aims to reach 120 million new family planning users by 2020. Drug shops and pharmacies are important private-sector sources of contraception in many contexts but are less well understood than public-sector sources, especially in urban environments. This article explores the role that drug shops and pharmacies play in the provision of contraceptive methods in selected urban areas of Nigeria and Kenya as well as factors associated with women's choice of where to obtain these methods. Using data collected in 2010\/2011 from representative samples of women in selected urban areas of Nigeria and Kenya as well as a census of pharmacies and drug shops audited in 2011, we examine the role of drug shops and pharmacies in the provision of short-acting contraceptive methods and factors associated with a women's choice of family planning source. In urban Nigeria and Kenya, drug shops and pharmacies were the major source for the family planning methods of oral contraceptive pills, emergency contraceptives, and condoms. The majority of injectable users obtained their method from public facilities in both countries, but 14% of women in Nigeria and 6% in Kenya obtained injectables from drug shops or pharmacies. Harder-to-reach populations were the most likely to choose these outlets to obtain their short-acting methods. For example, among users of these methods in Nigeria, younger women (&lt;25 years old) were significantly more likely to obtain their method from a drug shop or pharmacy than another type of facility. In both countries, family planning users who had never been married were significantly more likely than married users to obtain these methods from a drug shop or a pharmacy than from a public-sector health facility. Low levels of family planning-related training (57% of providers in Kenya and 41% in Nigeria had received training) and lack of family planning promotional activities in pharmacies and drug shops in both countries indicate the need for additional support from family planning programs to leverage this important access point. Drug shops and pharmacies offer an important and under-leveraged mechanism for expanding family planning access to women in urban Nigeria and Kenya, and potentially elsewhere. Vulnerable and harder-to-reach groups such as younger, unmarried women and women who do not yet have children are the most likely to benefit from increased access to family planning at drug shops and pharmacies. ","489":null,"490":"Although Ghana has a well-organized primary health care system, it lacks policies and guidelines for developing or providing emergency referral services. In 2012, an emergency referral pilot-the Sustainable Emergency Referral Care (SERC) initiative-was launched by the Ghana Health Service in collaboration with community stakeholders and health workers in one subdistrict of the Upper East Region where approximately 20,000 people reside. The pilot program was scaled up in 2013 to a 3-district (12-subdistrict) plausibility trial that served a population of approximately 184,000 over 2 years from 2013 to 2015. The SERC initiative was fielded as a component of a 6-year health systems strengthening and capacity-building project known as the Ghana Essential Health Intervention Program. Implementation research using mixed methods, including quantitative analysis of key process and health indicators over time in the 12 intervention subdistricts compared with comparison districts, a survey of health workers, and qualitative systems appraisal with community members, provided data on effectiveness of the system as well as operational challenges and potential solutions. Monitoring data show that community exposure to SERC was associated with an increased volume of emergency referrals, diminished reliance on primary care facilities not staffed or equipped to provide surgical care, and increased caseloads at facilities capable of providing appropriate acute care (i.e., district hospitals). Community members strongly endorsed the program and expressed appreciation for the service. Low rates of adherence to some care protocols were noted: referring facilities often failed to alert receiving facilities of incoming patients, not all patients transported were accompanied by a health worker, and receiving facilities commonly failed to provide patient outcome feedback to the referring facility. Yet in areas where SERC worked to bypass substandard points of care, overall facility-based maternal mortality as well as accident-related deaths decreased relative to levels observed in facilities located in comparison areas.","491":"","492":"","493":"","494":"The majority of the maternal and perinatal deaths are preventable through improved emergency obstetric and newborn care at facilities. However, the quality of such care in India has significant gaps in terms of provider skills and in their preparedness to handle emergencies. We tested the feasibility, acceptability, and effectiveness of a \"skills and drills\" intervention, implemented between July 2013 and September 2014, to improve emergency obstetric and newborn care in the state of Karnataka, India. Emergency drills through role play, conducted every 2 months, combined with supportive supervision and a 2-day skills refresher session were delivered across 4 sub-district, secondary-level government facilities by an external team of obstetric and pediatric specialists and nurses. We evaluated the intervention through a quasi-experimental design with 4 intervention and 4 comparison facilities, using delivery case sheet reviews, pre- and post-knowledge tests among providers, objective structured clinical examinations (OSCEs), and qualitative in-depth interviews. Primary outcomes consisted of improved diagnosis and management of selected maternal and newborn complications (postpartum hemorrhage, pregnancy-induced hypertension, and birth asphyxia). Secondary outcomes included knowledge and skill levels of providers and acceptability and feasibility of the intervention. Knowledge scores among providers improved significantly in the intervention facilities; in obstetrics, average scores between the pre- and post-test increased from 49% to 57% (P=.006) and in newborn care, scores increased from 48% to 56% (P=.03). Knowledge scores in the comparison facilities were similar but did not improve significantly over time. Skill levels were significantly higher among providers in intervention facilities than comparison facilities (mean objective structured clinical examination scores for obstetric skills: 55% vs. 46%, respectively; for newborn skills: 58% vs. 48%, respectively; P&lt;.001 for both obstetric and newborn), along with their confidence in managing complications. However, this did not result in significant differences in correct diagnosis and management of complications between intervention and comparison facilities. Shortage of trained nurses and doctors along with unavailability of a consistent supply chain was cited by most providers as major health systems barriers affecting provision of care. Improvements in knowledge, skills, and confidence levels of providers as a result of the skills and drills intervention was not sufficient to translate into improved diagnosis and management of maternal and newborn complications. System-level changes including adequate in-service training may also be necessary to improve maternal and newborn outcomes. ","495":"In the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), the Ministry of Health authorizes only physicians and nurses to give injections, with one exception-medical and nursing students may also give injections if supervised by a clinical instructor. The emergence of the injectable contraceptive Sayana Press in some African countries prompted the DRC to test the acceptability and feasibility of distributing Sayana Press and other contraceptive methods at the community level through medical and nursing students. Sayana Press is similar in formulation to the injectable contraceptive Depo-Provera but contains a lower dose and is administered subcutaneously using a single-use syringe with a short needle called the Uniject system. The Uniject system allows Sayana Press to be administered by community health workers without clinical training or by self-injection. In this pilot, the advocacy objective was to obtain approval from the Ministry of Health to allow medical and nursing students to inject Sayana Press, as a first step toward authorization for community health workers to provide the method. The pilot described in this article documents a process whereby an innovative approach moved from concept to implementation to replication in less than 2 years. It also paved the way for testing additional progressive strategies to increase access to contraception at the community level. Because the pilot project included a research component designed to assess benefits and challenges, it provided the means to introduce the new task-shifting approach, which might not have been approved otherwise. Key pilot activities included: (1) increasing awareness of Sayana Press among family planning stakeholders at a national conference on family planning, (2) enlisting the support of key decision makers in designing the pilot, (3) obtaining marketing authorization to distribute Sayana Press in the DRC, (4) implementing the pilot from July to December 2015, (5) conducting quantitative and qualitative studies to assess acceptability and feasibility, and (6) disseminating the findings to family planning stakeholders. Before the pilot, Sayana Press was relatively unknown in the DRC, and there was no precedent for medical and nursing students providing family planning methods or giving injections at the community level. In less than 12 months, the approach gained legitimacy and acceptance. The key Ministry of Health decision maker orchestrated the closing session of the dissemination meeting on next steps, paving the way for pilot tests of 3 new task-shifting approaches: insertion of Implanon NXT by medical and nursing students, self-injection for Sayana Press with supervision by students, and injection of Sayana Press by community health workers with no formal clinical training.","496":"Indoor residual spraying (IRS) for malaria prevention has traditionally been implemented in Ethiopia by the district health office with technical and operational inputs from regional, zonal, and central health offices. The United States President's Malaria Initiative (PMI) in collaboration with the Government of Ethiopia tested the effectiveness and efficiency of integrating IRS into the government-funded community-based rural health services program. Between 2012 and 2014, PMI conducted a mixed-methods study in 11 districts of Oromia region to compare district-based IRS (DB IRS) and community-based IRS (CB IRS) models. In the DB IRS model, each district included 2 centrally located operational sites where spray teams camped during the IRS campaign and from which they traveled to the villages to conduct spraying. In the CB IRS model, spray team members were hired from the communities in which they operated, thus eliminating the need for transport and camping facilities. The study team evaluated spray coverage, the quality of spraying, compliance with environmental and safety standards, and cost and performance efficiency. The average number of eligible structures found and sprayed in the CB IRS districts increased by 19.6% and 20.3%, respectively, between 2012 (before CB IRS) and 2013 (during CB IRS). Between 2013 and 2014, the numbers increased by about 14%. In contrast, in the DB IRS districts the number of eligible structures found increased by only 8.1% between 2012 and 2013 and by 0.4% between 2013 and 2014. The quality of CB IRS operations was good and comparable to that in the DB IRS model, according to wall bioassay tests. Some compliance issues in the first year of CB IRS implementation were corrected in the second year, bringing compliance up to the level of the DB IRS model. The CB IRS model had, on average, higher amortized costs per district than the DB IRS model but lower unit costs per structure sprayed and per person protected because the community-based model found and sprayed more structures. Established community-based service delivery systems can be adapted to include a seasonal IRS campaign alongside the community-based health workers' routine activities to improve performance efficiency. Further modifications of the community-based IRS model may reduce the total cost of the intervention and increase its financial sustainability. ","497":"","498":null,"499":"High-quality postabortion care (PAC) services that include family planning counseling and a full range of contraceptives at point of treatment for abortion complications have great potential to break the cycle of repeat unintended pregnancies and demand for abortions. We describe the first application of a systematic approach to quality improvement of PAC services in a West African country. This approach-IntraHealth International's Optimizing Performance and Quality (OPQ) approach-was applied at 5 health care facilities in Togo starting in November 2014. A baseline assessment identified the following needs: reorganizing services to ensure that contraceptives are provided at point of treatment for abortion complications, before PAC clients are discharged; improving provider competencies in family planning services, including in providing long-acting reversible contraceptive implants and intrauterine devices; ensuring that contraceptive methods are available to all PAC clients free of charge; standardizing PAC registers and enhancing data collection and reporting systems; enhancing internal supervision systems at facilities and teamwork among PAC providers; and engaging PAC providers in community talks. Solutions devised and applied at the facilities during OPQ resulted in significant increases in contraceptive counseling and uptake among PAC clients: During the 5-month baseline period, 31% of PAC clients were counseled, while during the 13-month intervention period, 91% were counseled. Of all PAC clients counseled during the baseline period, 37% accepted a contraceptive, compared with 60% of those counseled during the intervention period. Oral contraceptive pills remained the most popular method during both periods, yet uptake of implants increased significantly during the intervention period-from 4% to 27% of those accepting contraceptives. This result demonstrates that the solutions applied maintained method choice while expanding access to underused long-acting reversible contraceptives. OPQ shows great potential for sustainability and scale in Togo and for application in similar contexts where the health system struggles to offer safe, high-quality, accessible PAC services.","500":"In 2014, the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV\/AIDS released its 90-90-90 targets, which make laboratory diagnostics a cornerstone for measuring efforts toward the epidemic control of HIV. A data-driven laboratory harmonization and standardization approach is one way to create efficiencies and ensure optimal laboratory procurements. Following the 2008 \"Maputo Declaration on Strengthening of Laboratory Systems\"-a call for government leadership in harmonizing tiered laboratory networks and standardizing testing services-several national ministries of health requested that the United States Government and in-country partners help implement the recommendations by facilitating laboratory harmonization and standardization workshops, with a primary focus on improving HIV laboratory service delivery. Between 2007 and 2015, harmonization and standardization workshops were held in 8 African countries. This article reviews progress in the harmonization of laboratory systems in these 8 countries. We examined agreed-upon instrument lists established at the workshops and compared them against instrument data from laboratory quantification exercises over time. We used this measure as an indicator of adherence to national procurement policies. We found high levels of diversity across laboratories' diagnostic instruments, equipment, and services. This diversity contributes to different levels of compliance with expected service delivery standards. We believe the following challenges to be the most important to address: (1) lack of adherence to procurement policies, (2) absence or limited influence of a coordinating body to fully implement harmonization proposals, and (3) misalignment of laboratory policies with minimum packages of care and with national HIV care and treatment guidelines. Overall, the effort to implement the recommendations from the Maputo Declaration has had mixed success and is a work in progress. Program managers should continue efforts to advance the principles outlined in the Maputo Declaration. Quantification exercises are an important method of identifying instrument diversity, and provide an opportunity to measure efforts toward standardization.","501":null,"502":"The 2014 outbreak of Ebola virus disease (EVD) in West Africa was the largest ever recorded. Starting in September 2014, International Medical Corps (IMC) managed 5 Ebola treatment units (ETUs) in Liberia and Sierra Leone, which cumulatively cared for about 2,500 patients. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of patient data collected at the 5 ETUs over 1 year of operations. To collect clinical and epidemiological data from the patient care areas, each chart was either manually copied across the fence between the high-risk zone and low-risk zone, imaged across the fence, or imaged in the high-risk zone. Each ETU's data were entered into a separate electronic database, and these were later combined into a single relational database. Lot quality assurance sampling was used to ensure data quality, with reentry of data with high error rates from imaged records. The IMC database contains records on 2,768 patient presentations, including 2,351 patient admissions with full follow-up data. Of the patients admitted, 470 (20.0%) tested positive for EVD, with an overall case fatality ratio (CFR) of 57.0% for EVD-positive patients and 8.1% for EVD-negative patients. Although more men were admitted than women (53.4% vs. 46.6%), a larger proportion of women were diagnosed EVD positive (25.6% vs. 15.2%). Diarrhea, red eyes, contact with an ill person, and funeral attendance were significantly more common in patients with EVD than in those with other diagnoses. Among EVD-positive patients, age was a significant predictor of mortality: the highest CFRs were among children under 5 (89.1%) and adults over 55 (71.4%). While several prior reports have documented the experiences of individual ETUs, this study is the first to present data from multiple ETUs across 2 countries run by the same organization with similar clinical protocols. Our experience demonstrates that even in austere settings under difficult conditions, it is possible for humanitarian organizations to collect high-quality clinical and epidemiologic data during a major infectious disease outbreak.

Nearly one-third of married women have an unmet need for family planning, but the supply of family planning services is not meeting the demand. This study aimed to explore the safety and effectiveness of training 2 cadres of community health workers-traditional birth attendants (TBAs) and agentes polivalentes elementares (APEs) (polyvalent elementary health workers)-to administer the injectable contraceptive depot-medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA), and to provide evidence to policy makers on the feasibility of expanding community-based distribution of DMPA in areas where TBAs and APEs are present. A total of 1,432 women enrolled in the study between February 2014 and April 2015. The majority (63% to 66%) of women in the study started using contraception for the first time during the study period, and most women (over 66%) did not report side effects at the 3-month and 6-month follow-up visits. Very few (less than 0.5%) experienced morbidities at the injection site on the arm. Satisfaction with the performance of TBAs and APEs was high and improved over the study period. Overall, the project showed a high continuation rate (81.1%) after 3 injections, with TBA clients having significantly higher continuation rates than APE clients after 3 months and after 6 months. Clients' reported willingness to pay for DMPA (64%) highlights the latent demand for modern contraceptives. Given Mozambique's largely rural population and critical health care workforce shortage, community-based provision of family planning in general and of injectable contraceptives in particular, which has been shown to be safe, effective, and acceptable, is of crucial importance. This study demonstrates that community-based distribution of injectable contraceptives can provide access to family planning to a large group of women that previously had little or no access.","508":"Recurrent illness following hospital discharge is a major contributor to childhood mortality in resource-poor countries. Yet post-discharge care is largely ignored by health care workers and policy makers due to a lack of resources to identify children with recurrent illness and a lack of cohesive systems to provide care. The purpose of this proof-of-concept study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a bundle of interventions at discharge to improve health outcomes during the vulnerable post-discharge period. The study was conducted between December 2014 and April 2015. Eligible children were between ages 6 months and 5 years who were admitted with a suspected or proven infectious disease to one of two hospitals in Mbarara, Uganda. A bundle of interventions was provided at the time of discharge. This bundle included post-discharge referrals for follow-up visits and a discharge kit. The post-discharge referral was to ensure follow-up with a nearby health care provider on days 2, 7, and 14 following discharge. The discharge kit included brief educational counseling along with simple preventive items as incentives (soap, a mosquito net, and oral rehydration salts) to reinforce the education. The primary study outcome was the number of post-discharge referral visits completed. Secondary study outcomes included satisfaction with the intervention, rates of readmission after 60 days, and post-discharge mortality rates. In addition, outcomes were compared with a historical control group, enrolled using the same inclusion criteria and outcome-ascertainment methods. During the study, 216 children were admitted, of whom 14 died during hospitalization. Of the 202 children discharged, 85% completed at least 1 of the 3 follow-up referral visits, with 48% completing all 3 visits. Within 60 days after discharge, 22 children were readmitted at least once and 5 children (2.5%) died. Twelve (43%) readmissions occurred during a scheduled follow-up visit. Compared with prospectively enrolled historical controls, the post-discharge referral for follow-up increased the odds of readmission (odds ratio [OR], 1.92; 95% confidence interval [CI], 1.14 to 3.23) and care sought after discharge (OR, 14.61; 95% CI, 9.41 to 22.67). Overall satisfaction with the bundle of interventions was high, with most caregivers strongly agreeing that the discharge kit and post-discharge referrals improved their ability to care for their child. Interventions initiated at the time of discharge have the potential to profoundly affect the landscape of care during illness recovery and lead to significantly improved outcomes among children under 5 years of age. ","509":"Supportive counseling type interventions are frequently provided to meet the mental health needs of populations in emergency and post-conflicts contexts, but it has seldom been rigorously evaluated. Existing evaluations from low- and middle-income countries provide mixed evidence of effectiveness. While Iraqi Kurdistan experienced relative stability following the fall of Saddam Hussein's government, the population in the northern Dohuk region has continued to experience periodic violence due to conflicts with neighboring Turkey as well as more recent ISIS-associated violence. We evaluated the impact of a trauma-informed support, skills, and psychoeducation intervention provided by community mental health workers (CMHWs) on depressive symptoms and dysfunction (primary outcomes) as well as post-traumatic stress, traumatic grief, and anxiety symptoms (secondary outcomes). Between June 2009 and June 2010, 295 adults were screened; 209 (71%) met eligibility criteria (trauma exposure and a symptom severity score indicating significant distress and functional impairment, among others) and consented to participate. Of these, 159 were randomized to supportive counseling while 50 were randomized to a waitlist control condition. Comparing average symptom severity scores post-treatment among those in the intervention group with those in the waitlist control group, the supportive counseling program had statistically and clinically significant impacts on the primary outcomes of depression (Cohen's d, 0.57; P = .02) and dysfunction (Cohen's d, 0.53; P = .03) and significant but smaller impacts on anxiety. Although studies by the same research team of psychotherapeutic interventions in other parts of Kurdistan and in southern Iraq found larger effects, this study adds to the global research literature on mental health and psychosocial support and shows that a well-trained and supervised program of trauma-informed support, skills, and psychoeducation that emphasizes the therapeutic relationship can also be effective.","510":"","511":"Worldwide 75 million women need postabortion care (PAC) services each year following safe or unsafe induced abortions and miscarriages. We reviewed more than 550 studies on PAC published between 1994 and 2013 in the peer-reviewed and gray literature, covering emergency treatment, postabortion family planning, organization of services, and related topics that impact practices and health outcomes, particularly in the Global South. In this article, we present findings from studies with strong evidence that have major implications for programs and practice. For example, vacuum aspiration reduced morbidity, costs, and time in comparison to sharp curettage. Misoprostol 400 mcg sublingually or 600 mcg orally achieved 89% to 99% complete evacuation rates within 2 weeks in multiple studies and was comparable in effectiveness, safety, and acceptability to manual vacuum aspiration. Misoprostol was safely introduced in several PAC programs through mid-level providers, extending services to secondary hospitals and primary health centers. In multiple studies, postabortion family planning uptake before discharge increased by 30-70 percentage points within 1-3 years of strengthening postabortion family planning services; in some cases, increases up to 60 percentage points in 4 months were achieved. Immediate postabortion contraceptive acceptance increased on average from 32% before the interventions to 69% post-intervention. Several studies found that women receiving immediate postabortion intrauterine devices and implants had fewer unintended pregnancies and repeat abortions than those who were offered delayed insertions. Postabortion family planning is endorsed by the professional organizations of obstetricians\/gynecologists, midwives, and nurses as a standard of practice; major donors agree, and governments should be encouraged to provide universal access to postabortion family planning. Important program recommendations include offering all postabortion women family planning counseling and services before leaving the facility, especially because fertility returns rapidly (within 2 to 3 weeks); postabortion family planning services can be quickly replicated to multiple sites with high acceptance rates. Voluntary family planning uptake by method should always be monitored to document program and provider performance. In addition, vacuum aspiration and misoprostol should replace sharp curettage to treat incomplete abortion for women who meet eligibility criteria.","512":"In conflict-affected states, vouchers have reduced barriers to reproductive health services and have enabled health programs to use targeted subsidies to increase uptake of specific health services. Vouchers can also be used to channel funds to public- and private-service providers and improve service quality. The Yamaan Foundation for Health and Social Development in Yemen and the Marie Stopes Society (MSS) in Pakistan-both working with Options Consultancy Services-have developed voucher programs that subsidize voluntary access to long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) and permanent methods (PMs) of family planning in their respective fragile countries. The programs focus on LARCs and PMs because these methods are particularly difficult for poor women to access due to their cost and to provider biases against offering them. Using estimates of expected voluntary uptake of LARCs and PMs for 2014 based on contraceptive prevalence rates, and comparing these with uptake of LARCs and PMs through the voucher programs, we show the substantial increase in service utilization that vouchers can enable by contributing to an expanded method choice. In the governorate of Lahj, Yemen, vouchers for family planning led to an estimated 38% increase in 2014 over the expected use of LARCs and PMs (720 vs. 521 expected). We applied the same approach in 13 districts of Punjab, Khyber Pakhtunkhwa (KPK), and Sindh provinces in Pakistan. Our calculations suggest that vouchers enabled 10 times more women than expected to choose LARCs and PMs in 2014 in those areas of Pakistan (73,639 vs. 6,455 expected). Voucher programs can promote and maintain access to family planning services where existing health systems are hampered. Vouchers are a flexible financing approach that enable expansion of contraceptive choice and the inclusion of the private sector in service delivery to the poor. They can keep financial resources flowing where the public sector is prevented from offering services, and ensure that alternative sources are available for reproductive health services such as family planning. Programs should consider using vouchers in fragile states to facilitate access to family planning services and support the countries' health systems.","513":"The levonorgestrel intrauterine system (LNG IUS) is one of the most effective forms of contraception and offers important non-contraceptive health benefits. However, it is not widely available in developing countries, largely due to the high price of existing products. Medicines360 plans to introduce its new, more affordable LNG IUS in Kenya. The public-sector transfer price will vary by volume between US$12 to US$16 per unit; for an order of 100,000 units, the public-sector transfer price will be approximately US$15 per unit. We calculated the direct service delivery cost per couple-years of protection (CYP) of various family planning methods. The model includes the costs of contraceptive commodities, consumable supplies, instruments per client visit, and direct labor for counseling, insertion, removal, and resupply, if required. The model does not include costs of demand creation or training. We conducted interviews with key opinion leaders in Kenya to identify considerations for scale-up of a new LNG IUS, including strategies to overcome barriers that have contributed to low uptake of the copper intrauterine device. The direct service delivery cost of Medicines360's LNG IUS per CYP compares favorably with other contraceptive methods commonly procured for public-sector distribution in Kenya. The cost is slightly lower than that of the 3-month contraceptive injectable, which is currently the most popular method in Kenya. Almost all key opinion leaders agreed that introducing a more affordable LNG IUS could increase demand and uptake of the method. They thought that women seeking the product's non-contraceptive health benefits would be a key market segment, and most agreed that the reduced menstrual bleeding associated with the method would likely be viewed as an advantage. The key opinion leaders indicated that myths and misconceptions among providers and clients about IUDs must be addressed, and that demand creation and provider training should be prioritized. Introducing a new, more affordable LNG IUS product could help expand choice for women in Kenya and increase use of long-acting reversible contraception. Further evaluation is needed to identify the full costs required for introduction-including the cost of demand creation-as well as research among potential and actual LNG IUS users, their partners, and health care providers to help inform scale-up of the method. ","514":"Between 2001 and 2006, IUD use in Uganda stagnated at 0.2% among women of reproductive age (WRA) ages 15-49. By 2011, IUD use had increased slightly to 0.4%. Recent studies report a significant increase in IUD use to 3.8%, but it is still low. Because the IUD is a little-used method in Uganda, we assessed the acceptability of the IUD by surveying women about their perceptions, attitudes, and beliefs. In August and September 2014, we conducted a cross-sectional survey among 1,505 WRA exiting public and private health facilities in Uganda. We collected information on women's attitudes, knowledge, and beliefs about the IUD, as well as their perceptions about its availability. We classified women's responses according to a behavior change framework with 3 summary constructs: opportunity (structural factors that influence behavior), ability (skills to perform the behavior), and motivation (self-interest in adopting the behavior). As these 3 types of factors are more favorable to the desired behavior (in this case, use of the IUD), individuals are more likely to perform the behavior. Cross-tabulations compared the percentage results of perceptions and knowledge by key background characteristics. Most (87.8%) of the surveyed women had heard of the IUD, and nearly two-thirds had a positive attitude toward the method. But a lower percentage (38.6%) had accurate information about the IUD and more than half (51.6%) did not think the method was available in a nearby facility. More than half of the women believed incorrectly that the IUD can damage the womb (57%), that it reduces sexual pleasure (54%), and that it can cause cancer (58%). Current use of family planning or of a modern method specifically was positively associated with awareness and accurate knowledge and beliefs about the IUD. Married women had significantly higher awareness of the IUD than single women, and they had better knowledge and belief scores. The type of facility used for health care services (public, private franchise, or private non-franchise) may also influence acceptance of the IUD. Interventions to increase the use of IUDs in Uganda should address low availability of the method in facilities, as well as misperceptions and misinformation, especially about the safety of the IUD. Demand promotion should address provider misperceptions in addition to client misperceptions and should include interpersonal communication and the mass media. ","515":"Where unmet need for the safest, most effective, and long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) is very high, the health system and partners need to implement problem-solving, locally feasible, and comprehensive family planning delivery strategies. Because young and unmarried women are most at risk for unintended pregnancy and repeat abortion due to poor access to contraceptive services, postabortion family planning (PAFP) is a key component in such strategies. In Southern Nations, Nationalities, and People's Region, Ethiopia, Ipas implemented health system strengthening efforts from fiscal year (FY) 2010 (July 2009 to June 2010) to FY 2014 (July 2013 to June 2014) to improve the quality of PAFP services and expand method choice in 101 public facilities. The intervention significantly improved PAFP uptake at the project sites. Specifically, the proportion of abortion clients receiving LARCs progressively improved during the intervention period. The proportion of abortion clients who left the facilities with a contraceptive method increased from 58% in FY 2010 to 83% in FY 2014. The share of method mix for LARCs rose from 2% in FY 2010 to 55% in FY 2014, while the share for condoms, injectables, and oral contraceptives declined from 98% to 45%. Implant use rose from 2% in FY 2010 to 43% in FY 2014, while the use of intrauterine devices increased from 0.1% in FY 2010 to 12% in FY 2014. A larger proportion of PAFP users received LARCs at health centers, where midwives and nurses are the primary providers, than at hospitals (59% versus 37%, respectively). A broader method mix can satisfy clients with a variety of needs, a key factor for higher uptake of more effective methods and program success. Further evidence-based interventions need to be implemented to improve the quality of PAFP in a feasible and replicable strategy that addresses unmet need for modern contraceptive methods.","516":"The global health community has recognized that expanding the contraceptive method mix is a programmatic imperative since (1) one-third of unintended pregnancies are due to method failure or discontinuation, and (2) the addition of a new method to the existing mix tends to increase total contraceptive use. Since July 2011, CARE has been implementing the Supporting Access to Family Planning and Post-Abortion Care (SAFPAC) initiative to increase the availability, quality, and use of contraception, with a particular focus on highly effective and long-acting reversible methods-intrauterine devices (IUDs) and implants-in crisis-affected settings in Chad and the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). This initiative supports government health systems at primary and referral levels to provide a wide range of contraceptive services to people affected by conflict and\/or displacement. Before the initiative, long-acting reversible methods were either unknown or unavailable in the intervention areas. However, as soon as trained providers were in place, we noted a dramatic and sustained increase in new users of all contraceptive methods, especially implants, with total new clients reaching 82,855, or 32% of the estimated number of women of reproductive age in the respective catchment areas in both countries, at the end of the fourth year. Demand for implants was very strong in the first 6 months after provider training. During this time, implants consistently accounted for more than 50% of the method mix, reaching as high as 89% in Chad and 74% in DRC. To ensure that all clients were getting the contraceptive method of their choice, we conducted a series of discussions and sought feedback from different stakeholders in order to modify program strategies. Key program modifications included more focused communication in mass media, community, and interpersonal channels about the benefits of IUDs while reinforcing the wide range of methods available and refresher training for providers on how to insert IUDs to strengthen their competence and confidence. Over time, we noted a gradual redistribution of the method mix in parallel with vigorous continued family planning uptake. This experience suggests that analyzing method mix can be helpful for designing program strategies and that expanding method choice can accelerate satisfying demand, especially in environments with high unmet need for contraception.","517":"Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs) are safe and highly effective, and they have higher continuation rates than short-acting methods. Because only a small percentage of sexually active women in Kenya use LARCs, the Tupange project implemented a multifaceted approach to increase uptake of LARCs, particularly among the urban poor. The project included on-site mentoring, whole-site orientation, commodity security, quality improvement, and multiple demand-promotion and service-provision strategies, in the context of wide method choice. We report on activities in Nairobi between July 2011 and December 2014, the project implementation period. We used a household longitudinal survey of women of reproductive age to measure changes in the contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) and other family planning-related variables. At baseline in July 2010, 2,676 women were interviewed; about 50% were successfully tracked and interviewed at endline in December 2014. A baseline service delivery point (SDP) survey of 112 health facilities and 303 service providers was conducted in July 2011, and an endline SDP survey was conducted in December 2014 to measure facility-based interventions. The SDP baseline survey was conducted after the household survey, as facilities were selected based on where clients said they obtained services. The project led to significant increases in use of implants and intrauterine devices (IUDs). Uptake of implants increased by 6.5 percentage points, from 2.4% at baseline to 8.9% by endline, and uptake of IUDs increased by 2.1 percentage points, from 2.2% to 4.3%. By the endline survey, 37.7% of clients using pills and injectables at baseline had switched to LARCs. Contraceptive use among the poorest and poor wealth quintiles increased by 20.5 and 21.5 percentage points, respectively, from baseline to endline. Various myths and misconceptions reported about family planning methods declined significantly between baseline and endline. Training, commodity security, multiple service delivery models, and demand promotion were the cornerstones of a successful approach to reach the urban poor in Nairobi with LARCs. ","518":"To broaden access to family planning in rural areas and improve contraceptive prevalence, Senegal, in the context of wide method choice, is promoting implants and the intrauterine device, currently used throughout the country by only 5.6% of women of reproductive age who are in union, primarily urban women. The TutoratPlus performance improvement approach strengthens family planning clinical skills, particularly for long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), through mentoring, task sharing, and community outreach. Following a 2013 baseline situation analysis, 290 participating facilities in 12 of Senegal's 14 regions developed action plans to address gaps identified in 3 areas: provider performance, equipment, and infrastructure. Between 2013 and 2014, 85 trained mentors coached, demonstrated skills, and observed 857 providers, including nurses, nonclinical family planning counselors, and community health workers (CHWs), in LARC service provision through two 5-day visits per facility at 21-day intervals. We used routine service delivery data and TutoratPlus mentoring data to assess changes in contraceptive use, including LARCs, 6 months before and 6 months after the mentoring intervention among 100 of the facilities with complete data. The baseline assessment of 290 facilities found that fewer than half (47%) had a provider who could offer at least 1 LARC method, and 64% to 69% lacked kits. Post-intervention, all 290 facilities were adequately equipped and clinically able to offer LARCs. Among the 552 clinical providers, the percentage with acceptable LARC performance (at least 80% of observation checklist items correct) doubled from 32% to 67% over the 2 mentoring visits. In the 100 facilities with available comparison data, the number of new LARC users rose from 1,552 to 2,879 in the 6 months pre- and post-intervention-an 86% increase. Success of the TutoratPlus approach in Senegal is likely in part attributable to addressing facility-specific needs, using on-site mentoring to assess provider capacity, and achieving workplace enhancements through community engagement. Without CHW-initiated community outreach, LARC uptake might have been lower. Although task sharing requires institutionalization within national health systems, TutoratPlus demonstrates that provider skills can be improved, facilities can be better equipped, and demand can be promoted using existing government and community resources. ","519":"Increasing access to the intrauterine device (IUD), as part of a comprehensive method mix, is a key strategy for reducing unintended pregnancy and maternal mortality in low-income countries. To expand access to IUDs within the framework of informed choice, Population Services International (PSI) has historically supported increased IUD service delivery through private providers. In applying a total market lens to better understand the family planning market and address major market gaps, PSI identified a lack of high-quality public provision of IUDs. In 2013, PSI started a pilot in 4 countries (Guatemala, Laos, Mali, and Uganda) to grow public-provider IUD service delivery through increased public-sector engagement while maintaining its ongoing focus on private providers. In collaboration with country governments, PSI affiliates carried out family planning market analyses in the 4 pilot countries to identify gaps in IUD service delivery and create sustainable strategies for scaling up IUD services in the public sector. Country-specific interventions to increase service delivery were implemented across all levels of the public health system, including targeted advocacy at the national level to promote government ownership and program sustainability. Mechanisms to ensure government ownership were built into the program design, including a proof-of-concept approach to convince governments of the feasibility and value of taking over and scaling up interventions. In the first 2 years of the pilot (2013-2014), 102,055 IUD services were provided to women at 417 targeted public-sector facilities. These preliminary results suggest that there is untapped demand for IUD service delivery in the public sector that can be met in part through greater participation of the public sector in family planning and IUD provision.","520":"","521":null,"522":"Bangladesh has achieved a low total fertility rate of 2.3. Two-thirds of currently married women of reproductive age (CMWRA) want to limit fertility, and many women achieve their desired fertility before age 30. The incidence of unintended pregnancy and pregnancy termination is high, however. Long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), consisting of the intrauterine device and implant, and permanent methods (PM), including female sterilization and vasectomy, offer several advantages in this situation, but only 8% of CMWRA or 13% of method users use these methods. The Mayer Hashi (MH) program (2009-2013) aimed to improve access to and the quality of LARC\/PM services in 21 of the 64 districts in Bangladesh. It was grounded in the SEED (supply-enabling environment-demand) Programming Model. Supply improvements addressed provider knowledge and skills, system strengthening, and logistics. Creating an enabling environment involved holding workshops with local and community leaders, including religious leaders, to encourage them to help promote demand for LARCs and PMs and overcome cultural barriers. Demand promotion encompassed training of providers in counseling, distribution of behavior change communication materials in the community and in facilities, and community mobilization. We selected 6 MH program districts and 3 nonprogram districts to evaluate the program. We used a before-after and intervention-comparison design to measure the changes in key contraceptive behavior outcomes, and we used a difference-in-differences (DID) specification with comparison to the nonprogram districts to capture the impact of the program. In addition to the outcome evaluation, we considered intermediate indicators that measured the processes through which the interventions were expected to affect the use of LARCs and PMs. The use of LARCs\/PMs among CMWRA increased between 2010 and 2013 in both program (from 5.3% to 7.5%) and nonprogram (from 5.0% to 8.9%) districts, but the rate of change was higher in the nonprogram districts. Client-provider interaction and exposure to LARCs\/PMs were lower in the program than nonprogram districts, and the MH program districts had higher vacancies of key providers than the nonprogram areas, both indications of a more difficult health system environment. The weaknesses in the health system in the MH districts apparently undermined the effectiveness of the program. More attention to system weaknesses, such as additional supportive supervision for providers, might have improved the outcome. ","523":"This article evaluates the use of modern contraceptives among poor women exposed to a family planning voucher program in Cambodia, with a particular focus on the uptake of long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs). We used a quasi-experimental study design and data from before-and-after intervention cross-sectional household surveys (conducted in 2011 and 2013) in 9 voucher program districts in Kampong Thom, Kampot, and Prey Veng provinces, as well as 9 comparison districts in neighboring provinces, to evaluate changes in use of modern contraceptives and particularly LARCs in the 12 months preceding each survey. Survey participants in the analytical sample were currently married, non-pregnant women ages 18 to 45 years (N = 1,936 at baseline; N = 1,986 at endline). Difference-in-differences (DID) analyses were used to examine the impact of the family planning voucher. Modern contraceptive use increased in both intervention and control areas between baseline and endline: in intervention areas, from 22.4% to 31.6%, and in control areas, from 25.2% to 31.0%. LARC use also increased significantly between baseline and endline in both intervention (from 1.4% to 6.7%) and control (from 1.9% to 3.5%) areas, but the increase in LARC use was 3.7 percentage points greater in the intervention area than in the control area (P = .002), suggesting a positive and significant association of the voucher program with LARC use. The greatest increases occurred among the poorest and least educated women. A family planning voucher program can increase access to and use of more effective long-acting methods among the poor by reducing financial and information barriers. ","524":"","525":"","526":"The World Health Organization and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV\/AIDS recommend early infant male circumcision (EIMC) as a component of male circumcision programs in countries with high HIV prevalence and low circumcision rates. Lesotho began incorporating EIMC into routine maternal, newborn, and child health (MNCH) services in 2013 with funding from the United States Agency for International Development and United Nations Children's Fund. This presented unique challenges: Lesotho had no previous experience with EIMC and cultural traditions link removal of the foreskin to rites of passage. This process evaluation provides an overview of EIMC implementation. The Lesotho Ministry of Health and Jhpiego conducted a baseline assessment before service implementation. Baseline information from an initial assessment was used to develop and implement an EIMC program that had a pilot and a scale-up phase. Key program activities such as staff training, quality assurance, and demand creation were included at the program design phase. Facilitating factors and challenges were identified from a review of information collected during the baseline assessment as well as the pilot. Between September 2013 and March 2015, 592 infants were circumcised at 9 sites: 165 (28%) between 1 day and 6 days after birth; 196 (33%) between 7 and 30 days, and 231 (39%) between 31 and 60 days. Facilitating factors included strong support from the Ministry of Health, collaboration with stakeholders, and donor funding. Providers were enthusiastic about the opportunity to offer new services and receive training. Challenges included gaining consent from family members other than mothers, and parents' concern about pain and complications. The EIMC program also had to manage providers' expectations of compensation because overtime was paid to providers who took part in adult circumcision programming but not for EIMC. Limited human resources, including authorization only for doctors to perform EIMC, impeded provision of services. Despite communication, compensation, and task-shifting challenges, integrating EIMC services with MNCH services could be a sustainable model for EIMC service delivery in Lesotho. ","527":"The government of the Kingdom of Swaziland recognizes that it must urgently scale up HIV prevention interventions, such as voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). Swaziland has adopted a 2-phase approach to male circumcision scale-up. The catch-up phase prioritizes VMMC services for adolescents and adults, while the sustainability phase involves the establishment of early infant male circumcision (EIMC). Swaziland does not have a modern-day tradition of circumcision, and the VMMC program has met with client demand challenges. However, since the launch of the EIMC program in 2010, Swaziland now leads the Eastern and Southern Africa region in the scale-up of EIMC. Here we review Swaziland's program and its successes and challenges. From February to May 2014, we collected data while preparing Swaziland's \"Male Circumcision Strategic and Operational Plan for HIV Prevention 2014-2018.\" We conducted structured stakeholder focus group discussions and in-depth interviews, and we collected EIMC service delivery data from an implementing partner responsible for VMMC and EIMC service delivery. Data were summarized in consolidated narratives. Between 2010 and 2014, trained providers performed more than 5,000 EIMCs in 11 health care facilities in Swaziland, and they reported no moderate or severe adverse events. According to a broad group of EIMC program stakeholders, an EIMC program needs robust support from facility, regional, and national leadership, both within and outside of HIV prevention coordination bodies, to promote institutionalization and ownership. Providers and health care managers in 3 of Swaziland's 4 regional hospitals suggest that when EIMC is introduced into reproductive, maternal, newborn, and child health platforms, dedicated staff attention can help ensure that EIMC is performed amid competing priorities. Creating informed demand from communities also supports EIMC as a service delivery priority. Formative research shows that EIMC programs should address the fears and anxieties of parents so that they, especially fathers, understand the health benefits of EIMC before the birth of their babies. The vast majority of public-sector facilities in Swaziland are led by nurses, and nurses and midwives have borne the brunt of caring for patients with HIV\/AIDS in Swaziland. Like prevention of mother-to-child transmission, EIMC provides an opportunity for nurses and midwives to stand at the forefront of HIV prevention efforts. Rapid scale-up of VMMC and EIMC in Swaziland has the potential to avert more than 56,000 HIV infections and save US$370 million in the next 20 years. ","528":"The 14 countries that are scaling up voluntary male medical circumcision (VMMC) for HIV prevention are also considering early infant male circumcision (EIMC) to ensure longer-term reductions in HIV incidence. The cost of implementing EIMC is an important factor in scale-up decisions. We conducted a comparative cost analysis of EIMC performed by nurse-midwives and doctors using the AccuCirc device in Zimbabwe. Between August 2013 and July 2014, nurse-midwives performed EIMC on 500 male infants using AccuCirc in a field trial. We analyzed the overall unit cost and identified key cost drivers of EIMC performed by nurse-midwives and compared these with costing data previously collected during a randomized noninferiority comparison trial of 2 devices (AccuCirc and the Mogen clamp) in which doctors performed EIMC. We assessed direct costs (consumable and nonconsumable supplies, device, personnel, associated staff training, and waste management costs) and indirect costs (capital and support personnel costs). We performed one-way sensitivity analyses to assess cost changes when we varied key component costs. The unit costs of EIMC performed by nurse-midwives and doctors in vertical programs were US$38.87 and US$49.77, respectively. Key cost drivers of EIMC were consumable supplies, personnel costs, and the device price. In this cost analysis, major cost drivers that explained the differences between EIMC performed by nurse-midwives and doctors were personnel and training costs, both of which were lower for nurse-midwives. EIMC unit costs were lower when performed by nurse-midwives compared with doctors. To minimize costs, countries planning to scale up EIMC should consider using nurse-midwives, who are in greater supply than doctors and are the main providers at the primary health care level, where most infants are born. ","529":"The World Health Organization (WHO) and the United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) recommend early infant male circumcision (EIMC) for prevention of HIV. Here, we present findings from a qualitative study in Zimbabwe that assessed parental and health care workers' perspectives of EIMC conducted using devices. This qualitative study was nested within a trial of EIMC devices. Between January and May 2013, we held 4 focus group discussions (FGDs) and 12 in-depth interviews with parents and 12 in-depth interviews with clinicians (7 trial clinicians and 5 non-trial clinicians). We also conducted 95 short telephone interviews with parents who had arranged to bring their sons for EIMC but then defaulted. Parents who had adopted EIMC spoke of their initial anxieties about the procedure. Additionally, they commented on both the procedure and outcome. Parents who decided against EIMC cited fear of harm, specifically the infant's death, penile injury, and excessive pain. Misperceptions about male circumcision in general and EIMC specifically were a significant barrier to EIMC adoption and were prevalent among health care workers as well as parents. In particular, the findings suggest strong parental concerns about the fate of the discarded foreskin. Parents who chose EIMC for their newborn sons felt that the procedure was safe and expressed satisfaction with the outcome. For their part, health care workers largely thought that EIMC was safe and that the outcome was aesthetically pleasing. They also felt that it would be feasible to offer wide-scale EIMC for HIV prevention in the public sector; they recommended strategies to increase EIMC uptake, in addition to highlighting a few concerns. The qualitative study enables us to better understand parental and health care workers' perspectives of EIMC conducted using devices, especially their perspectives on EIMC safety, feasibility, acceptability, and barriers. These findings will be used to design demand-generation activities that support wider adoption of EIMC. ","530":"For prevention of HIV, early infant male circumcision (EIMC) needs to be scaled up in countries with high HIV prevalence. Routine EIMC will maintain the HIV prevention gains anticipated from current adult male circumcision initiatives. We present here the results of a field study of EIMC conducted in Zimbabwe. The study was observational and based on the World Health Organization (WHO) framework for clinical evaluation of male circumcision devices. We recruited parents of newborn male infants between August 2013 and July 2014 from 2 clinics. Nurse-midwives used the AccuCirc device to circumcise eligible infants. We followed participants for 14 days after EIMC. Outcome measures were EIMC safety, acceptability, and feasibility. We enrolled 500 male infants in the field study (uptake 11%). The infants were circumcised between 6 and 60 days postpartum. The procedure took a median of 17 minutes (interquartile range of 5 to 18 minutes). Mothers' knowledge of male circumcision was extensive. Of the 498 mothers who completed the study questionnaire, 91% knew that male circumcision decreases the risk of HIV acquisition, and 83% correctly stated that this prevention is partial. Asked about their community's perception of EIMC, 40% felt that EIMC will likely be viewed positively in their community; 13% said negatively; and 47% said the perception could be both ways. We observed 7 moderate or severe adverse events (1.4%; 95% confidence interval, 0.4% to 2.4%). All resolved without lasting effects. Nearly all mothers (99%) reported great satisfaction with the outcome, would recommend EIMC to other parents, and would circumcise their next sons. This first field study in sub-Saharan Africa of the AccuCirc device for EIMC demonstrated that EIMC conducted by nurse-midwives with this device is safe, feasible, and acceptable to parents. ","531":"","532":"Iringa region of Tanzania has had great success reaching targets for voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC). Looking to sustain high coverage of male circumcision, the government introduced a pilot project to offer early infant male circumcision (EIMC) in Iringa in 2013. From April 2013 to December 2014, a total of 2,084 male infants were circumcised in 8 health facilities in the region, representing 16.4% of all male infants born in those facilities. Most circumcisions took place 7 days or more after birth. The procedure proved safe, with only 3 mild and 3 moderate adverse events (0.4% overall adverse event rate). Overall, 93% of infants were brought back for a second-day visit and 71% for a seventh-day visit. These percentages varied significantly by urban and rural residence (97.4% urban versus 84.6% rural for day 2 visit; 82.2% urban versus 49.9% rural for day 7 visit). Mothers were more likely than fathers to have received information about EIMC. However, fathers tended to be key decision makers regarding circumcision of their sons. This suggests the importance of addressing fathers with behavioral change communication about EIMC. Successes in scaling up VMMC services in Iringa did not translate into immediate acceptability of EIMC. EIMC programs will require targeted investments in demand creation to expand and thrive in traditionally non-circumcising settings such as Iringa.","533":"Male circumcision is almost universal in North and West Africa, and practiced for various reasons. Yet there is little documentation on service delivery, clinical procedures, policies, and programmatic strategies. The United Nations Children's Fund (UNICEF) commissioned country program reviews in 2014 to shed light on the delivery of male circumcision services for infants in Cameroon and Senegal. We conducted a policy desk review, key informant interviews, and focus group discussions at health centers and in communities. Between December 2014 and January 2015, we conducted 21 key informant interviews (13 with regional and district officers, 5 with national officers, and 3 with UNICEF officials) and 36 focus group discussions (6 with men, 6 with women, 12 with adolescent boys, and 12 with service providers). Some of the men and women were parents of the adolescents who participated in the focus group discussions. In the French-speaking areas, the focus group discussions were conducted in French through an accredited translator, audio recorded, and transcribed into English. All of the facilities we visited in Cameroon and Senegal offer medical male circumcision, with 10 out of 12 performing early infant male circumcision (EIMC) routinely. Neither country has policies, guidelines, or strategies for EIMC. The procedure is done mainly by untrained service providers, with some providers using modern circumcision devices. There are no key messages on EIMC for families; the increasing demand for EIMC is led by the community. Despite the absence of national policies and strategies, EIMC is routinely offered at all levels of the health care system in Cameroon and Senegal, mainly by untrained service providers. Improving circumcision services will require guidelines for EIMC and improvements in training, equipment, supply chains, recordkeeping, and demand creation.

In this article, we describe the process of developing the family planning algorithms and implementation of the mobile job aid, discuss how the job aid supported collection of real-time data for decision making, and present the cost of the overall system based on an evaluation of the pilot. The family planning algorithm was developed, beginning in June 2011, in partnership with the Tanzania Ministry of Health and Social Welfare based on a combination of evidence-based tools such as the Balanced Counseling Strategy Plus Toolkit. The pilot intervention and study was implemented with 25 CHWs in 3 wards in Ilala district in Dar es Salaam between January 2013 and July 2013. A total of 710 family planning users (455 continuing users and 255 new users) were registered and counseled using the mobile job aid over the 6-month intervention period. All users were screened for current pregnancy, questioned on partner support for contraceptive use, counseled on a range of contraceptives, and screened for HIV\/STI risk. Most new and continuing family planning users chose pills and male condoms (59% and 73%, respectively). Pills and condoms were provided by the CHW at the community level. Referrals were made to the health facility for pregnancy confirmation, injectable contraceptives, long-acting reversible contraceptives and HIV\/STI testing. Follow-up visits with clients were planned to confirm completion of the health facility referral. The financial cost of implementing this intervention with 25 CHWs and 3 supervisors are estimated to be US$26,000 for the first year. For subsequent years, the financial costs are estimated to be 73% lower at $7,100. Challenges such as limited client follow-up by CHWs and use of data by supervisors identified during the pilot are currently being addressed during the scale-up phase by developing accountability and incentive mechanisms for CHWs and dashboards for data access and use.","544":"In global health, partnerships between practitioners and policy makers facilitate stakeholders in jointly addressing those issues that require multiple perspectives for developing, implementing, and evaluating plans, strategies, and programs. For family planning, costed implementation plans (CIPs) are developed through a strategic government-led consultative process that results in a detailed plan for program activities and an estimate of the funding required to achieve an established set of goals. Since 2009, many countries have developed CIPs. Conventionally, the CIP approach has not been defined with partnerships as a focal point; nevertheless, cooperation between key stakeholders is vital to CIP development and execution. Uganda launched a CIP in November 2014, thus providing an opportunity to examine the process through a partnership lens. This article describes Uganda's CIP development process in detail, grounded in a framework for assessing partnerships, and provides the findings from 22 key informant interviews. Findings reveal strengths in Uganda's CIP development process, such as willingness to adapt and strong senior management support. However, the evaluation also highlighted challenges, including district health officers (DHOs), who are a key group of implementers, feeling excluded from the development process. There was also a lack of planning around long-term partnership practices that could help address anticipated execution challenges. The authors recommend that future CIP development efforts use a long-term partnership strategy that fosters accountability by encompassing both the short-term goal of developing the CIP and the longer-term goal of achieving the CIP objectives. Although this study focused on Uganda's CIP for family planning, its lessons have implications for any policy or strategy development efforts that require multiple stakeholders to ensure successful execution.","545":null,"546":"Diarrhea is the fourth leading cause of child mortality in Ghana. In 2010, Ghana endorsed guidelines from the World Health Organization and the United Nations Children's Fund for use of zinc with low-osmolarity oral rehydration salts (ORS) for the treatment of acute childhood diarrhea. From late 2011 through 2014, the Strengthening Health Outcomes through the Private Sector (SHOPS) project implemented a comprehensive program in 3 regions of Ghana to increase the availability and use of ORS and zinc and to decrease incorrect use of antibiotics and antidiarrheals. The program included (1) partnering with local pharmaceutical firms to introduce and market locally produced zinc products, (2) collaborating with the Ghanaian Pharmacy Council to provide training and supportive supervision of private-sector providers on diarrhea management, and (3) conducting mass media campaigns to raise caregiver awareness. We evaluated the effect of this program using a baseline survey of 754 caregivers of children under 5 with diarrhea at the start of the intervention in 2012 and a follow-up survey of 751 caregivers in 2014. Regression analysis showed that use of ORS with zinc increased from 0.8% in 2012 to 29.2% in 2014 (P&lt;.001), and antibiotic use declined from 66.2% to 38.2% (P&lt;.001) during the same period. The magnitude and statistical significance of these results remained the same after including potential confounding factors as covariates. Inappropriate antibiotic use, however, remained high at follow-up. We conclude that similar programs applied in other settings have the potential to rapidly scale up use of ORS and zinc. Additional efforts are required to reduce persistent incorrect antibiotic use.","547":"Tanzania successfully scaled up coverage of long-lasting insecticidal nets (LLINs) through mass campaigns. To sustain these gains, a school-based approach was piloted in the country's Southern Zone starting in 2013, called the School Net Program 1 (SNP1). We report on the design, implementation, monitoring, and outputs of the second round (SNP2) undertaken in 2014. SNP2 was conducted in all schools in Lindi, Mtwara, and Ruvuma regions, targeting students in primary (Standards 1, 3, 5, and 7) and secondary (Forms 2 and 4) schools and all teachers. In Lindi region, 2 additional classes (Standards 2 and 4) were targeted. LLIN distribution data were managed using an Android software application called SchoolNet. SNP2 included 2,337 schools, 473,700 students, and 25,269 teachers. A total of 5,070 people were trained in LLIN distribution (487 trainers and 4,583 distributors), and 4,392 (434 ward and 3,958 village) community change agents undertook sensitization and mobilization. A total of 507,775 LLINs were distributed to schools, with 464,510 (97.9% of those registered) students and 24,206 (95.8% of those registered) school teachers receiving LLINs.

Approaches to strengthening supply chains in such settings have often fallen short-they address technical weaknesses, but not the incentives that motivate staff to perform better. We reviewed the first year of a results-based financing (RBF) program in Mozambique, which began in January 2013. The program aimed to improve the performance of the central medical store-Central de Medicamentos e Artigos Medicos (CMAM)-by realigning incentives. We completed in-depth interviews and focus group discussions with 33 key informants, including representatives from CMAM and donor agencies, and collected quantitative data on performance measures and use of funds. The RBF agreement linked CMAM performance payments to quarterly results on 5 performance indicators related to supply planning, distribution planning, and warehouse management. RBF is predicated on the theory that a combination of carrot and stick-i.e., shared financial incentives, plus increased accountability for results-will spur changes in behavior. Important design elements: (1) indicators were measured against quarterly targets, and payments were made only for indicators that met those targets; (2) targets were set based on documented performance, at levels that could be reasonably attained, yet pushed for improvement; (3) payment was shared with and dependent on all staff, encouraging teamwork and collaboration; (4) results were validated by verifiable data sources; and (5) CMAM had discretion over how to use the funds. We found that CMAM's performance continually improved over baseline and that CMAM achieved many of its performance targets, for example, timely submission of quarterly supply and distribution planning reports. Warehouse indicators, such as inventory management and order fulfillment, proved more challenging but were nonetheless positive. By linking payments to periodic verified results, and giving CMAM discretion over how to spend the funds, the RBF agreement motivated the workforce; focused attention on results; strengthened data collection; encouraged teamwork and innovation; and ultimately strengthened the central supply chain. Policy makers and program managers can use performance incentives to catalyze and leverage existing investments. To further strengthen the approach, such incentive programs can shift attention from quantity to quality indicators, improve verification processes, and aim to institutionalize the approach. ","555":"Equitable access to programs and health services is essential to achieving national and international health goals, but it is rarely assessed because of perceived measurement challenges. One of these challenges concerns the complexities of collecting the data needed to construct asset or wealth indices, which can involve asking as many as 40 survey questions, many with multiple responses. To determine whether the number of variables and questions could be reduced to a level low enough for more routine inclusion in evaluations and research without compromising programmatic conclusions, we used data from a program evaluation in Honduras that compared a pro-poor intervention with government clinic performance as well as data from a results-based financing project in Senegal. In both, the full Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) asset questionnaires had been used as part of the evaluations. Using the full DHS results as the \"gold standard,\" we examined the effect of retaining successively smaller numbers of variables on the classification of the program clients in wealth quintiles. Principal components analysis was used to identify those variables in each country that demonstrated minimal absolute factor loading values for 8 different thresholds, ranging from 0.05 to 0.70. Cohen's kappa statistic was used to assess correlation. We found that the 111 asset variables and 41 questions in the Honduras DHS could be reduced to 9 variables, captured by only 8 survey questions (kappa statistic, 0.634), without substantially altering the wealth quintile distributions for either the pro-poor program or the government clinics or changing the resulting policy conclusions. In Senegal, the 103 asset variables and 36 questions could be reduced to 32 variables and 20 questions (kappa statistic, 0.882) while maintaining a consistent mix of users in each of the 2 lowest quintiles. Less than 60% of the asset variables in the 2 countries' full DHS asset indices overlapped, and in none of the 8 simplified asset index iterations did this proportion exceed 50%. We conclude that substantially reducing the number of variables and questions used to assess equity is feasible, producing valid results and providing a less burdensome way for program implementers or researchers to evaluate whether their interventions are pro-poor. Developing a standardized, simplified asset questionnaire that could be used across countries may prove difficult, however, given that the variables that contribute the most to the asset index are largely country-specific.

Using a single-visit approach to prevent cervical cancer, the Addis Tesfa (New Hope) project in Ethiopia tested women with HIV through visual inspection of the cervix with acetic acid wash (VIA) and, if tests results were positive, offered immediate cryotherapy of the precancerous lesion or referral for loop electrosurgical excision procedure (LEEP). The objective of this article is to review screening and treatment outcomes over nearly 4 years of project implementation and to identify lessons learned to improve cervical cancer prevention programs in Ethiopia and other resource-constrained settings. We analyzed aggregate client data from August 2010 to March 2014 to obtain the number of women with HIV who were counseled, screened, and treated, as well as the number of annual follow-up visits made, from the 14 tertiary- and secondary-level health facilities implementing the single-visit approach. A health facility assessment (HFA) was also implemented from August to December 2013 to examine the effects of the single-visit approach on client flow, staff workload, and facility infrastructure 3 years after initiating the approach. Almost all (99%) of the 16,632 women with HIV counseled about the single-visit approach were screened with VIA during the study period; 1,656 (10%) of them tested VIA positive (VIA+) for precancerous lesions. Among those who tested VIA+ and were thus eligible for cryotherapy, 1,481 (97%) received cryotherapy treatment, but only 80 (63%) women eligible for LEEP actually received the treatment. The HFA results showed frequent staff turnover, some shortage of essential supplies, and rooms that were judged by providers to be too small for delivery of cervical cancer prevention services. The high proportions of VIA screening and cryotherapy treatment in the Addis Tesfa project suggest high acceptance of such services by women with HIV and feasibility of implementation in secondary- and tertiary-level health facilities. However, success of cervical cancer prevention programming must address wider health system challenges to ensure sustainability and appropriate scale-up to the general population of Ethiopia and other resource-constrained settings.

The study's aim was to test the effectiveness of increased social support by key household influencers on improving mothers' complementary feeding practices. Using a quasi-experimental design, we enrolled mothers, fathers, and grandmothers from households with infants 6-9 months old in 3 rural communities (1 intervention arm with fathers, 1 intervention arm with grandmothers, and 1 comparison arm) in western Kenya. We engaged 79 grandmothers and 85 fathers in separate dialogue groups for 6 months from January to July 2012. They received information on health and nutrition and were encouraged to provide social support to mothers (defined as specific physical actions in the past 2 weeks or material support actions in the past month). We conducted a baseline household survey in December 2011 in the 3 communities and returned to the same households in July 2012 for an endline survey. We used a difference-in-difference (DiD) approach and logistic regression to evaluate the intervention. We surveyed 554 people at baseline (258 mothers, 165 grandmothers, and 131 fathers) and 509 participants at endline. The percentage of mothers who reported receiving 5 or more social support actions (of a possible 12) ranged from 58% to 66% at baseline in the 3 groups. By endline, the percentage had increased by 25.8 percentage points (P=.002) and 32.7 percentage points (P=.001) more in the father and the grandmother intervention group, respectively, than in the comparison group. As the number of social support actions increased in the 3 groups, the likelihood of a mother reporting that she had fed her infant the minimum number of meals in the past 24 hours also increased between baseline and endline (odds ratio [OR], 1.14; confidence interval [CI], 1.00 to 1.30; P=.047). When taking into account the interaction effects of intervention area and increasing social support over time, we found a significant association in the grandmother intervention area on dietary diversity (OR, 1.19; CI, 1.01 to 1.40; P=.04). No significant effects were found on minimum acceptable diet. Engaging fathers and grandmothers of infants to improve their knowledge of optimal infant feeding practices and to encourage provision of social support to mothers could help improve some feeding practices. Future studies should engage all key household influencers in a family-centered approach to practice and support infant feeding recommendations.

This study explores the relationship between household wealth and the use of long-acting and permanent methods (LAPMs) versus short-acting methods of contraception among modern method users, using multivariate analyses based on Demographic Health Survey data from 30 developing countries conducted between 2006 and 2013. Overall, and controlling for relevant individual and household characteristics including age, number of living children, education, and urban\/rural residence, we found that wealthier women were more likely than poorer women to use LAPMs instead of short-acting methods: 20 of the 30 countries showed a positive and statistically significant association between wealth and LAPM use. For 10 of those countries, however, LAPM use was significantly higher only for the top (1 or 2) wealthiest quintiles. Eight countries showed no broad pattern of association, while in 2 countries-Bangladesh and India-poorer women were more likely to use LAPMs than wealthier women. The positive association between wealth and LAPM use was found most consistently in the Latin American and the Caribbean countries in our sample. These findings can help program implementers respond better to women's needs for modern contraception, especially in reaching women from lower- and middle-income households.

A nurse mentoring program was implemented in northern Karnataka, India, to improve quality of services at primary health centers (PHCs), the lowest level in the public health system that offers basic obstetric care. The intervention, conducted between August 2012 and July 2014, employed 53 full-time nurse mentors and was scaled-up in 385 PHCs in 8 poor rural districts. Each mentor was responsible for 6 to 8 PHCs and conducted roughly 6 mentoring visits per PHC in the first year. This paper reports the results of a qualitative inquiry, conducted between September 2012 and April 2014, assessing the program's successes and challenges from the perspective of mentors and PHC teams. Data were gathered through 13 observations, 9 focus group discussions with mentors, and 25 individual and group interviews with PHC nurses, medical officers, and district health officers. Mentors and PHC staff and leaders reported a number of successes, including development of rapport and trust between mentors and PHC staff, introduction of team-based quality improvement processes, correct and consistent use of a new case sheet to ensure adherence to clinical guidelines, and increases in staff nurses' knowledge and skills. Overall, nurses in many PHCs reported an increased ability to provide care according to guidelines and to handle maternal and newborn complications, along with improvements in equipment and supplies and referral management. Challenges included high service delivery volumes and\/or understaffing at some PHCs, unsupportive or absent PHC leadership, and cultural practices that impacted quality. Comprehensive mentoring can build competence and improve performance by combining on-the-job clinical and technical support, applying quality improvement principles, and promoting team-based problem solving. ","571":"Challenges in data availability and quality have contributed to the longest and deadliest Ebola epidemic in history that began in December 2013. Accurate surveillance data, in particular, has been difficult to access, as it is often collected in remote communities. We describe the design, implementation, and challenges of implementing a smartphone-based contact tracing system that is linked to analytics and data visualization software as part of the Ebola response in Guinea. The system, built on the mobile application CommCare and business intelligence software Tableau, allows for real-time identification of contacts who have not been visited and strong accountability of contact tracers through timestamps and collection of GPS points with their surveillance data. Deployment of this system began in November 2014 in Conakry, Guinea, and was expanded to a total of 5 prefectures by April 2015. To date, the mobile system has not replaced the paper-based system in the 5 prefectures where the program is active. However, as of April 30, 2015, 210 contact tracers in the 5 prefectures were actively using the mobile system to collectively monitor 9,162 contacts. With proper training, some investment in technical hardware, and adequate managerial oversight, there is opportunity to improve access to surveillance data from difficult-to-reach communities in order to inform epidemic control strategies while strengthening health systems to reduce risk of future disease outbreaks. ","572":"Modern contraceptive prevalence was 14.1% in 2007 in Kinshasa, the capital city of the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Yet virtually nothing was known about the family planning supply environment. Three surveys of health facilities were conducted in 2012, 2013, and 2014 to determine the number, spatial distribution, and attributes of sites providing family planning services. The 2012 and 2013 surveys aimed to identify the universe of family planning facilities while obtaining a limited set of data on \"readiness\" to provide family planning services (defined as having at least 3 modern methods, at least 1 person training in family planning in the last 3 years, and an information system to track distribution of products to clients) and output (measured by couple-years of protection, or CYP). In contrast, the 2014 survey, conducted under the umbrella of the Performance Monitoring and Accountability 2020 (PMA2020) project, was based on 2-stage cluster sampling. This article provides detailed analysis of the 2012 and 2013 surveys, including bivariate and multivariate analysis of correlates of readiness to provide services and of output. We identified 184 health facilities that reported providing at least 1 contraceptive method in 2012 and 395 facilities in 2013. The percentage of sites defined as \"ready\" to provide services increased from 44.1% in 2012 to 63.3% in 2013. For the 3-month period between January and March 2013, facilities distributed between 0 and 879.2 CYP (mean, 39.7). Nearly half (49%) of the CYP was attributable to implants, followed by IUDs (24%), CycleBeads (11%), and injectables (8%). In 2013, facilities supported by PEPFAR (n = 121) were more likely than other facilities to be rated as ready to provide services (P&lt;.0001); however, PEPFAR-supported sites generated less CYP on average than sites supported by family planning implementing agencies (P&lt;.0001). Multivariate analysis showed 3 variables were associated with CYP: type of health facility, length of time in operation, and number of contraceptive methods available. Clinics generated higher (3-month) CYP than hospitals and health centers by 65.3 and 61.5 units, respectively (P&lt;.01). The mean CYP for facilities in operation for 4-6 years was 26.9 units higher (P&lt;.05), and 50.2 units higher for those operating 7+ years (P&lt;.01), than the reference group of facilities in operation for 1 year or less. For each additional method available at a facility, CYP increased by almost 8 units (P&lt;.01). Findings from these surveys suggest that lack of physical access is not the defining reason for low contraceptive use in Kinshasa, although it is highly likely that other service-related factors contribute to low service utilization. The results contributed to increasing the momentum for family planning in the DRC in many ways, including mobilizing partners to increase contraceptive access and increasing donor investment in family planning in the DRC. ","573":"Unintentional injury is a significant public health burden for American Indians and Alaska Natives and was the leading cause of death among those aged 1 to 44 years between 1999 and 2004. Of those deaths, motor vehicle-related deaths cause the most mortality, justifying the need for intervention at an American Indian Reservation in Arizona (United States). We describe motor vehicle injury prevention program operations from 2004 through 2013. This community-based approach led by a multidisciplinary team primarily comprised of environmental public health and law enforcement personnel implemented evidence-based strategies to reduce the impact of motor vehicle-related injuries and deaths, focusing on reducing impaired driving and increasing occupant restraint use. Strategies included: mass media campaigns to enhance awareness and outreach; high-visibility sobriety checkpoints; passing and enforcing 0.08% blood alcohol concentration limits for drivers and primary occupant restraint laws; and child car seat distribution and education. Routine monitoring and evaluation data showed a significant 5% to 7% annual reduction of motor vehicle crashes (MVCs), nighttime MVCs, MVCs with injuries\/fatalities, and nighttime MVCs with injuries\/fatalities between 2004 and 2013, but the annual percent change in arrests for driving under the influence (DUI) was not significant. There was also a 144% increase in driver\/front seat passenger seat belt use, from 19% in 2011 before the primary occupant restraint law was enacted to 47% during the first full year of enforcement (2013). Car seat checkpoint data also suggested a 160% increase in car seat use, from less than 20% to 52% in 2013. Implementation of evidence-based strategies in injury prevention, along with employment of key program approaches such as strong partnership building, community engagement, and consistent staffing and funding, can narrow the public health disparity gap experienced among American Indian and Alaska Native communities. ","574":"Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is an important HIV prevention strategy, particularly in regions with high HIV incidence and low rates of male circumcision. However, 88% of the Zambian male population remain uncircumcised, and of these 80% of men surveyed expressed little interest in undergoing VMMC. The Spear and Shield study (consisting of 4 weekly, 90-minute sexual risk reduction\/VMMC promotion sessions) recruited and enrolled men (N = 800) who self-identified as at risk of HIV by seeking HIV testing and counseling at community health centers. Eligible men tested HIV-negative, were uncircumcised, and expressed no interest in VMMC. Participants were encouraged (but not required) to invite their female partners (N = 668) to participate in the program in a gender-concordant intervention matched to their partners'. Men completed assessments at baseline, post-intervention (about 2 months after baseline), and 6 and 12 months post-intervention; women completed assessments at baseline and post-intervention. For those men who underwent VMMC and for their partners, an additional assessment was conducted 3 months following the VMMC. The ancillary analysis in this article compared the pre- and post-VMMC responses of the 257 Zambian men who underwent circumcision during or following study participation, using growth curve analyses, as well as of the 159 female partners. Men were satisfied overall with the procedure (mean satisfaction score, 8.4 out of 10), and nearly all men (96%) and women (94%) stated they would recommend VMMC to others. Approximately half of the men reported an increase or no change in erections, orgasms, and time to achieve orgasms from pre-VMMC, while one-third indicated fewer erections and orgasms and decreased time to achieve orgasms post-VMMC. Nearly half (42%) of the men, and a greater proportion (63%) of the female partners, said their sexual pleasure increased while 22% of the men reported less sexual pleasure post-VMMC. Growth curve analysis of changes in sexual functioning and satisfaction over time revealed no changes in erectile functioning or intercourse satisfaction, but there were increases in orgasm functioning, overall sexual satisfaction, and sexual desire. The majority (61% to 70%) of men and women thought penile cleanliness and appearance had improved post-VMMC. Of the 69% of men who reported having sexual intercourse at least once between having the procedure and their 3-month post-VMMC assessment, the large majority (76%) waited at least 6 weeks before resuming sex. Sexual intercourse prior to the 6-week healing period was associated with adverse events and lower levels of post-VMMC sexual satisfaction. Both men and their partners can generally expect equal or improved sexual satisfaction and penile hygiene following VMMC. Future studies should consider innovative strategies to assist men in their efforts to abstain from sexual activities prior to complete healing. ","575":"Donors are increasingly interested in the transition and sustainability of global health programs as priorities shift and external funding declines. Systematic and high-quality monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) of such processes is rare. We propose a framework and related guiding questions to systematize the M&amp;E of global health program transitions. We conducted stakeholder interviews, searched the peer-reviewed and gray literature, gathered feedback from key informants, and reflected on author experiences to build a framework on M&amp;E of transition and to develop guiding questions. The conceptual framework models transition as a process spanning pre-transition and transition itself and extending into sustained services and outcomes. Key transition domains include leadership, financing, programming, and service delivery, and relevant activities that drive the transition in these domains forward include sustaining a supportive policy environment, creating financial sustainability, developing local stakeholder capacity, communicating to all stakeholders, and aligning programs. Ideally transition monitoring would begin prior to transition processes being implemented and continue for some time after transition has been completed. As no set of indicators will be applicable across all types of health program transitions, we instead propose guiding questions and illustrative quantitative and qualitative indicators to be considered and adapted based on the transition domains identified as most important to the particular health program transition. The M&amp;E of transition faces new and unique challenges, requiring measuring constructs to which evaluators may not be accustomed. Many domains hinge on measuring \"intangibles\" such as the management of relationships. Monitoring these constructs may require a compromise between rigorous data collection and the involvement of key stakeholders. Monitoring and evaluating transitions in global health programs can bring conceptual clarity to the transition process, provide a mechanism for accountability, facilitate engagement with local stakeholders, and inform the management of transition through learning. Further investment and stronger methodological work are needed. ","576":"Emergency medical services (EMS) systems provide professional prehospital emergency medical care and transportation to help improve outcomes from emergency conditions. Ghana's national ambulance service has relatively low public utilization in comparison with the large burden of acute disease. A survey instrument was developed using Pechansky and Thomas's model of access covering 5 dimensions of availability, accessibility, accommodation, affordability, and acceptability. The instrument was used in a cross-sectional survey in 2013 in Accra, Ghana; eligible participants were those 18 years and older who spoke English, French, or Twi. Although the analysis was mainly descriptive, logistic regression was used to identify factors associated with reported intention to call for an ambulance in the case of a medical emergency. 468 participants completed surveys, with a response rate of 78.4%. Few (4.5%) respondents had ever used an ambulance in prior emergency situations. A substantial proportion (43.8%) knew about the public access medical emergency telephone number, but of those only 37.1% knew it was a toll-free call. Most (54.7%) respondents believed EMTs offered high-quality care, but 78.0% believed taxis were faster than ambulances and 69.2% thought the number of ambulances in Accra insufficient. Many (23.4%) thought using ambulances to transport corpses would be appropriate. In two hypothetical emergency scenarios, respondents most commonly reported taxis as the preferred transportation (63.6% if a family member were burned in a house fire, 64.7% if a pedestrian were struck by a vehicle). About 1 in 5 respondents said they would call an ambulance in either scenario (20.7% if a family member were burned in a house fire, 23.3% if a pedestrian were struck by a vehicle) while 15.5% and 10.2%, respectively, would use any available vehicle. Those aged 18-35 years were more likely than older respondents to prefer an ambulance (odds ratio [OR], 2.27; confidence interval [CI], 1.47 to 3.68), as were those with prior ambulance experience (OR, 1.75; CI, 0.98 to 3.09) (compared with those with no prior experience) and those who believed ambulances were safer than taxis (OR, 2.17; CI, 1.1 to 4.2) (compared with those who did not hold such beliefs). Perceptions of public ambulance services in Accra, Ghana, are generally favorable, although use is low. Public health education to improve awareness of the toll-free medical emergency number and about appropriate use of ambulances while simultaneously improving the capacity of ambulance agencies to receive increased caseload could improve use of the EMS system.

This paper describes the design and implementation of the mass media intervention in detail, including the Saturation+ principles that underpinned the approach, the creative process, the lessons learned, and recommendations for implementing this intervention at scale. The Saturation+ approach focuses on the 3 core principles of saturation (ensuring high exposure to campaign messages), science (basing campaign design on data and modeling), and stories (focusing the dramatic climax on the target behavior) to maximize the impact of behavior change campaigns. In Burkina Faso, creative partnerships with local radio stations helped us obtain free airtime in exchange for training and investing in alternative energy supplies to solve frequent energy problems faced by the stations. The campaign used both short spots and longer drama formats, but we consider the short spots as a higher priority to retain during scale-up, as they are more cost-effective than longer formats and have the potential to ensure higher exposure of the population to the messages. The implementation research synthesized in this paper is designed to enable the effective adoption and integration of evidence-based behavior change communication interventions into health care policy and practice.

The Maternal and Child Health Integrated Project (MCHIP) supported the MOHSW to roll out VMMC services in Iringa and Njombe, 2 regions of Tanzania with among the highest HIV and lowest circumcision prevalence. With ambitious targets of reaching 264,990 males aged 10-34 years with VMMC in 5 years, efficient and innovative program approaches were necessary. Outreach campaigns, in which mobile teams set up temporary services in facilities or non-facility settings, are used to reach lesser-served areas with VMMC. In 2012, MCHIP began using geographic information systems (GIS) to strategically plan the location of outreach campaigns. MCHIP gathered geocoded data on variables such as roads, road conditions, catchment population, staffing, and infrastructure for every health facility in Iringa and Njombe. These data were uploaded to a central database and overlaid with various demographic and service delivery data in order to identify the VMMC needs of the 2 regions. MCHIP used the interactive digital maps as decision-making tools to extend mobile VMMC outreach to \"the last kilometer.\" As of September 2014, the MOHSW with MCHIP support provided VMMC to 267,917 men, 259,144 of whom were men were aged 10-34 years, an achievement of 98% of the target of eligible males in Iringa and Njombe. The project reached substantially more men through rural dispensaries and non-health care facilities each successive year after GIS was introduced in 2012, jumping from 48% of VMMCs performed in rural areas in fiscal year 2011 to 88% in fiscal year 2012 and to 93% by the end of the project in 2014. GIS was an effective tool for making strategic decisions about where to prioritize VMMC service delivery, particularly for mobile and outreach services. Donors may want to consider funding mapping initiatives that support numerous interventions across implementing partners to spread initial start-up costs. ","586":"Growing international concern about the need for improved health systems in Africa has catalyzed an expansion of the health systems literature. This review applies a bibliometric procedure to analyze the acceleration of scientific writing on this theme. We focus on research published during the Millennium Development Goal (MDG) era between 1990 and 2014, reporting findings from a systematic review of a database comprised of 17,655 articles about health systems themes from sub-Saharan African countries or subregions. Using bibliometric tools for co-word textual analysis, we analyzed the incidence and associations of keywords and phrases to generate and visualize topical foci on health systems as clusters of themes, much in the manner that astronomers represent groupings of stars as galaxies of celestial entities. The association of keywords defines their relative position, with the size of images weighted by the relative frequency of terms. Sets of associated keywords are arrayed as stars that cluster as \"galaxies\" of concepts in the knowledge universe represented by health systems research from sub-Saharan Africa. Results show that health systems research is dominated by literature on diseases and categorical systems research topics, rather than on systems science that cuts across diseases or specific systemic themes. Systems research is highly developed in South Africa but relatively uncommon elsewhere in the region. \"Black holes\" are identified by searching for terms in our keyword library related to terms in widely cited reviews of health systems. Results identify several themes that are unexpectedly uncommon in the country-specific health systems literature. This includes research on the processes of achieving systems change, the health impact of systems strengthening, processes that explain the systems determinants of health outcomes, or systematic study of organizational dysfunction and ways to improve system performance. Research quantifying the relationship of governance indicators to health systems strengthening is nearly absent from the literature. Long-term experimental studies and statistically rigorous research on cross-cutting themes of health systems strengthening are rare. Studies of organizational malaise or corruption are virtually absent. Trend analysis shows the emergence of organizational research on specific priority diseases, such as on HIV\/AIDS, malaria, and tuberculosis, but portrays a lack of focus on integrated systems research on the general burden of disease. If health systems in Africa are to be strengthened, then organizational change research must be a more concerted focus in the future than has been the case in the past.","587":"Contraceptive prevalence rate (CPR) is a vital indicator used by country governments, international donors, and other stakeholders for measuring progress in family planning programs against country targets and global initiatives as well as for estimating health outcomes. Because of the need for more frequent CPR estimates than population-based surveys currently provide, alternative approaches for estimating CPRs are being explored, including using contraceptive logistics data. Using data from the Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) in 30 countries, population data from the United States Census Bureau International Database, and logistics data from the Procurement Planning and Monitoring Report (PPMR) and the Pipeline Monitoring and Procurement Planning System (PipeLine), we developed and evaluated 3 models to generate country-level, public-sector contraceptive prevalence estimates for injectable contraceptives, oral contraceptives, and male condoms. Models included: direct estimation through existing couple-years of protection (CYP) conversion factors, bivariate linear regression, and multivariate linear regression. Model evaluation consisted of comparing the referent DHS prevalence rates for each short-acting method with the model-generated prevalence rate using multiple metrics, including mean absolute error and proportion of countries where the modeled prevalence rate for each method was within 1, 2, or 5 percentage points of the DHS referent value. For the methods studied, family planning use estimates from public-sector logistics data were correlated with those from the DHS, validating the quality and accuracy of current public-sector logistics data. Logistics data for oral and injectable contraceptives were significantly associated (P&lt;.05) with the referent DHS values for both bivariate and multivariate models. For condoms, however, that association was only significant for the bivariate model. With the exception of the CYP-based model for condoms, models were able to estimate public-sector prevalence rates for each short-acting method to within 2 percentage points in at least 85% of countries. Public-sector contraceptive logistics data are strongly correlated with public-sector prevalence rates for short-acting methods, demonstrating the quality of current logistics data and their ability to provide relatively accurate prevalence estimates. The models provide a starting point for generating interim estimates of contraceptive use when timely survey data are unavailable. All models except the condoms CYP model performed well; the regression models were most accurate but the CYP model offers the simplest calculation method. Future work extending the research to other modern methods, relating subnational logistics data with prevalence rates, and tracking that relationship over time is needed. ","588":"While fortification of staple foods and condiments has gained enormous global traction, poor performance persists throughout many aspects of implementation, most notably around the critical element of regulatory monitoring, which is essential for ensuring foods meet national fortification standards. Where coverage of fortified foods is high, limited nutritional impact of fortification programs largely exists due to regulatory monitoring that insufficiently identifies and holds producers accountable for underfortified products. Based on quality assurance data from 20 national fortification programs in 12 countries, we estimate that less than half of the samples are adequately fortified against relevant national standards. In this paper, we outline key findings from a literature review, key informant interviews with 11 fortification experts, and semi-quantitative surveys with 39 individuals from regulatory agencies and the food fortification industry in 17 countries on the perceived effectiveness of regulatory monitoring systems and barriers to compliance against national fortification standards. Findings highlight that regulatory agencies and industry disagree on the value that enforcement mechanisms have in ensuring compliance against standards. Perceived political risk of enforcement and poorly resourced inspectorate capacity appear to adversely reinforce each other within an environment of unclear legislation to create a major hurdle for improving overall compliance of fortification programs against national standards. Budget constraints affect the ability of regulatory agencies to create a well-trained inspector cadre and improve the detection and enforcement of non-compliant and underfortified products. Recommendations to improve fortification compliance include improving technical capacity; ensuring sustained leadership, accountability, and funding in both the private and the public sectors; and removing political barriers to ensure consistent detection of underfortified products and enforcement of applicable fortification standards. Only by taking concrete steps to improve the entire regulatory system that is built on a cooperative working relationship between regulatory agencies and food producers will a nutrition strategy that uses fortification see its intended health effects. ","589":"While several indicators for reproductive health have improved for entire populations, few analyses are available for trends over time in the gaps between the poor and the rich. This paper tracks improvements in the equitable distribution of reproductive health indicators according to wealth quintiles, especially for contraceptive use, in 46 low- and middle-income countries based on national population-based surveys conducted between 1990 and 2013. It focuses on the gaps between the poorest and richest quintiles in the earliest and latest survey rounds across a number of reproductive health indicators related to family planning, fertility desires, antenatal care, and infant and child mortality, as well as on improvements in the absolute levels of contraceptive use by the poorest quintile. Gap changes were decomposed to show how the gaps can either diminish or grow due to either the bottom or top quintile, or both. In addition, bivariate correlation analysis was conducted to examine the relationship of the gaps, and of contraceptive use by the poor, to national family planning program efforts. Overall, the gaps between the poorest and richest have narrowed, due primarily to faster improvements among the poor than the rich. For example, the gap between the richest and poorest in the modern contraceptive prevalence rate has declined by 25%, from a 20.4 percentage point difference to a 15.4 point difference. And the gap has decreased more where family planning programs have been stronger. Across most of 18 other reproductive health indicators, the gaps have also been narrowing. For instance, the poor-rich gap for antenatal care decreased by over a third, from a difference of 30.7 percentage points to 19.6 percentage points. Gaps in infant and child mortality also have declined by about one-third. The pattern for contraceptive use in sub-Saharan Africa, however, has been mixed, with the gap actually increasing in some countries with strong programs. This disparity may largely reflect that family planning in the region is generally at an earlier stage in its history, and so programs may initially be reaching better-off clients, especially in urban areas. To promote additional equity, programs should emphasize efforts to increase access to voluntary family planning services to the least well-off, including those in rural and peri-urban areas.

This article summarizes the available evidence on the effectiveness of the Care Group approach, drawing on articles published in the peer-reviewed literature as well as data from unpublished but publicly available project evaluations and summary analyses of these evaluations. When implemented by strong international NGOs with adequate funding, Care Groups have been remarkably effective in increasing population coverage of key child survival interventions. There is strong evidence that Care Groups can reduce childhood undernutrition and reduce the prevalence of diarrhea. Finally, evidence from multiple sources, comprising independent assessments of mortality impact, vital events collected by Care Group Volunteers themselves, and analyses using the Lives Saved Tool (LiST), that Care Groups are effective in reducing under-5 mortality. For example, the average decline in under-5 mortality, estimated using LiST, among 8 Care Group projects was 32%. In comparison, among 12 non-Care Group child survival projects, the under-5 mortality declined, on average, by an estimated 11%. Care Group projects cost in the range of US$3-$8 per beneficiary per year. The cost per life saved is in the range of $441-$3,773, and the cost per disability-adjusted life year (DALY) averted is in the range of $15-$126. The Care Group approach, when implemented as described, appears to be highly cost-effective based on internationally accepted criteria. Care Groups represent an important and promising innovative, low-cost approach to increasing the coverage of key child survival interventions in high-mortality, resource-constrained settings. Next steps include further specifying the adjustments needed in government health systems to successfully incorporate the Care Group approach, testing the feasibility of these adjustments and of the effectiveness of Care Groups in pilot programs in government health systems, and finally assessing effectiveness at scale under routine field conditions in government health programs.

To date, action-oriented research in the nutrition field is thought to be the exception rather than the rule, but empirical evidence to support this claim is lacking. We conducted a survey of selected journals in nutrition and public health to assess the extent and nature of population nutrition research published in 2012 that embodied 5 defined characteristics of action-oriented research in relation to: (1) topic(s) of study, (2) processes\/influences, (3) actors, (4) methods, and (5) approaches. We identified 762 articles from the 6 selected nutrition journals and 77 nutrition-related articles from the 4 selected public health journals that met our search criteria. Only 7% of the 762 papers in nutrition journals had at least 1 of the 5 action-oriented research characteristics, compared with 36% of the 77 nutrition-related papers in the public health journals. Of all 80 articles that had at least 1 action-oriented research characteristic, only 5 articles (6.25%) embodied all 5 characteristics. Articles with action-oriented research covered a broad range of topics and processes\/influences, including policy, workforce development, and schools, as well as actors, such as program staff, store owners, parents, and school staff. In addition, various research methods were used, such as stakeholder analysis, ethnographic narrative, iterative action research, and decision tree modeling, as well as different approaches, including participant-observer and community-based participatory research. Action-oriented research represents a small fraction of articles published in nutrition journals, especially compared with public health journals. This reinforces recent calls to expand population nutrition research agendas to more effectively inform and guide the initiation, development, implementation, and governance of policies, programs, and interventions to address the varied forms of nutrition-related problems. With heightened attention to the magnitude and importance of nutrition problems worldwide, there are substantial reasons and opportunities to incentivize and support such expansion.

The process of transition to country ownership is already underway in the Eastern Caribbean; the Office of the US Global AIDS Coordinator (OGAC) has advised the region that PEPFAR funding is being redirected away from the Eastern Caribbean toward Caribbean countries with high disease burden to strengthen services for key populations. This article seeks to highlight and apply lessons learned from other donor transitions to support a successful transition of HIV programs in the Eastern Caribbean. Based on a rapid review of both peer-reviewed and gray literature on donor transitions to country ownership in family planning, HIV, and other areas, we identified 48 resources that addressed key steps in the transition process and determinants of readiness for transition. Analysis of the existing literature revealed 6 steps that could help ensure successful transition, including developing a clear roadmap articulated through high-level diplomacy; investing in extensive stakeholder engagement; and supporting monitoring and evaluation during and after the transition to adjust course as needed. Nine specific areas to assess a country's readiness for transition include: leadership and management capacity, political and economic factors, the policy environment, identification of alternative funding sources, integration of HIV programs into the wider health system, the institutionalization of processes, the strength of procurement and supply chain management, identification of staffing and training needs, and engagement of civil society and the private sector. In the Caribbean, key areas requiring strengthening to ensure countries in the region can maintain the gains made under PEPFAR include further engaging civil society and the private sector, building the capacity of NGOs to take on essential program functions, and maintaining donor support for targeted capacity building and long-term monitoring and evaluation efforts.

We present our findings and recommendations using a framework with 4 components: insight development; intervention design; implementation and coordination to achieve scale; and measurement, learning, and evaluation. Most program strategies lacked comprehensive insight development; formative research usually comprised general acceptability studies. Demand generation interventions varied across the countries, from advocacy with community leaders and community mobilization to use of interpersonal communication, mid- and mass media, and new technologies. Some shortcomings in intervention design included using general instead of tailored messaging, focusing solely on the HIV preventive benefits of VMMC, and rolling out individual interventions to address specific barriers rather than a holistic package. Interventions have often been scaled-up without first being evaluated for effectiveness and cost-effectiveness. We recommend national programs create coordinated demand generation interventions, based on insights from multiple disciplines, tailored to the needs and aspirations of defined subsets of the target population, rather than focused exclusively on HIV prevention goals. Programs should implement a comprehensive intervention package with multiple messages and channels, strengthened through continuous monitoring. These insights may be broadly applicable to other programs where voluntary behavior change is essential to achieving public health benefits.

However, fragmentation, poor economies of scale, inadequate financing, political opposition, a bias toward curative services, and weak regulatory and quality control systems pose serious challenges for the private sector. Social franchising addresses a number of these challenges by organizing small, independent health care businesses into quality-assured networks. Global franchisors Marie Stopes International (MSI) and Population Services International (PSI) have rapidly scaled their family planning social franchising programs in recent years, jointly delivering over 10.8 million couple-years of protection (CYPs) in 2014-up 26% from 8.6 million CYPs just 1 year prior. Drawing on experience across MSI's 17 and PSI's 25 social franchise networks across Africa, Asia, and Latin America and the Caribbean, this article documents the organizations' operational approaches, challenges faced, and solutions implemented. The organizations provide intensive capacity building and support for private-sector providers, including clinical training, branding, monitoring quality of franchised services, and commodity support. In addition, franchising programs engage providers and clients through behavior change communication (BCC) and demand generation activities to raise awareness and to attract clients, and they implement initiatives to ensure services are affordable for the lowest-income clients. Social franchise programs offer the private sector a collective platform to better engage government in health policy advocacy and for integrating into new public health care financing and procurement mechanisms. The future of social franchising will require developing approaches to scale-up and sustain the model cost-effectively, selectively integrating other health services into the franchise package, and being responsive to evolving health care financing approaches with the potential to contribute to universal health coverage.

This article describes an approach that aims to raise awareness and boost demand. Developed in India, the \"My Village Is My Home\" (MVMH) tool, known as Uma Imunizasaun (UI) in Timor-Leste, is a poster-sized material used by volunteers and health workers to record the births and vaccination dates of every infant in a community. Introduction of the tool in 5 districts of India (April 2012 to March 2013) and in 7 initial villages in Timor-Leste (beginning in January 2012) allowed community leaders, volunteers, and health workers to monitor the vaccination status of every young child and guided reminder and motivational visits. In 3 districts of India, we analyzed data on vaccination coverage and timeliness before and during use of the tool; in 2 other districts, analysis was based only on data for new births during use of the tool. In Timor-Leste, we compared UI data from the 3 villages with the most complete data with data for the same villages from the vaccination registers from the previous year. In both countries, we also obtained qualitative data about perceptions of the tool through interviews with health workers and community members. Assessments in both countries found evidence suggesting improved vaccination timeliness and coverage. In India, pilot communities had 80% or higher coverage of identified and eligible children for all vaccines. In comparison, overall coverage in the respective districts during the same time period was much lower, at 49% to 69%. In Timor-Leste, both the number of infants identified and immunized rose substantially with use of the tool compared with the previous year (236 vs. 155, respectively, identified as targets; 185 vs. 147, respectively, received Penta 3). Although data challenges limit firm conclusions, the experiences in both countries suggest that \"My Village Is My Home\" is a promising tool that has the potential to broaden program coverage by marshalling both community residents and health workers to track individual children's vaccinations. Three states in India have adopted the tool, and Timor-Leste had also planned to scale-up the initiative. ","622":"In Mozambique, 1.6 million people are living with HIV, and over 60% of the population lives in rural areas lacking access to health services. Mobile health clinics, implemented in 2013 in 2 provinces, are beginning to offer antiretroviral therapy (ART) and basic primary care services. Prior to introduction of the mobile health clinics in the communities, we performed a rapid ethnographic assessment to understand barriers to accessing HIV care and treatment services and acceptability and potential use of the mobile health clinics as an alternative means of service delivery. We conducted assessments in Gaza province in January 2013 and in Zambezia Province in April-May 2013 in districts where mobile health clinic implementation was planned. Community leaders served as key informants, and chain-referral sampling was used to recruit participants. Interviews were conducted with community leaders, health care providers, traditional healers, national health system patients, and traditional healer patients. Interviewees were asked about barriers to health services and about mobile health clinic acceptance. In-depth interviews were conducted with 117 participants (Gaza province, n = 57; Zambezia Province, n = 60). Barriers to accessing health services included transportation and distance-related issues (reliability, cost, and travel time). Participants reported concurrent use of traditional and national health systems. The decision to use a particular health system depended on illness type, service distance, and lack of confidence in the national health system. Overall, participants were receptive to using mobile health clinics for their health care and ability to increase access to ART. Hesitations concerning mobile health clinics included potentially long wait times due to high patient loads. Participants emphasized the importance of regular and published visit schedules and inclusion of community members in planning mobile health clinic services. Mobile health clinics can address many barriers to uptake of HIV services, particularly related to transportation issues. Involvement of community leaders, providers, traditional healers, and patients, as well as regularly scheduled mobile clinic visits, are critical to successful service delivery implementation in rural areas. ","623":"Nigeria has one of the highest maternal mortality ratios in the world. Poor health outcomes are linked to weak health infrastructure, barriers to service access, and consequent low rates of service utilization. In the northern state of Jigawa, a pilot study was conducted to explore the feasibility of deploying resident female Community Health Extension Workers (CHEWs) to rural areas to provide essential maternal, newborn, and child health services. Between February and August 2011, a quasi-experimental design compared service utilization in the pilot community of Kadawawa, which deployed female resident CHEWs to provide health post services, 24\/7 emergency access, and home visits, with the control community of Kafin Baka. In addition, we analyzed data from the preceding year in Kadawawa, and also compared service utilization data in Kadawawa from 2008-2010 (before introduction of the pilot) with data from 2011-2013 (during and after the pilot) to gauge sustainability of the model. Following deployment of female CHEWs to Kadawawa in 2011, there was more than a 500% increase in rates of health post visits compared with 2010, from about 1.5 monthly visits per 100 population to about 8 monthly visits per 100. Health post visit rates were between 1.4 and 5.5 times higher in the intervention community than in the control community. Monthly antenatal care coverage in Kadawawa during the pilot period ranged from 11.9% to 21.3%, up from 0.9% to 5.8% in the preceding year. Coverage in Kafin Baka ranged from 0% to 3%. Facility-based deliveries by a skilled birth attendant more than doubled in Kadawawa compared with the preceding year (105 vs. 43 deliveries total, respectively). There was evidence of sustainability of these changes over the 2 subsequent years. Community-based service delivery through a resident female community health worker can increase health service utilization in rural, hard-to-reach areas. ","624":"Malawi faces critical health care worker shortages of both physicians and nurses. The Global AIDS Interfaith Alliance (GAIA) began a nursing scholarship program in Malawi that requires graduates to work in the public sector for 4-5 years following graduation. The main objective of this study was to identify job satisfaction and retention factors of scholarship recipients after graduation. We conducted a mixed-methods study consisting of 30 individual qualitative interviews and 56 quantitative surveys that evaluated job satisfaction, factors associated with retention, and impact of the GAIA Nursing Scholarship Program. Participants included GAIA scholarship recipients who had graduated. We used thematic analysis to analyze qualitative interviews. Kruskal-Wallis, Spearman correlation, and chi-squared tests were used to analyze survey data. The majority of survey and interview participants indicated it was unlikely that they would leave the public sector (70% and 90%, respectively). Most interview and survey participants cited a lack of supplies, inadequate human resources, and high workload as major challenges to their work. Poor working relationships with management or coworkers was significantly correlated with consideration of changing jobs in the next 6 months (correlation coefficient -0.28, P &lt; .05 and -0.36, P &lt; .01, respectively). Low salaries, high workload, poor accommodations, and a lack of appreciation were the most common reasons given for considering leaving the public sector while job security, desire to pursue further education, and public service agreement were primary motivations for continuing to work in the public system. Participants felt supported by GAIA staff and expressed a desire to serve their communities in return by working in government-supported health facilities. Despite the many challenges faced by public-sector nurses, low-income countries such as Malawi can employ non-remuneration strategies to retain nurses in the public sector, including adequate housing, availability of supplies, advancement opportunities, and positive work environments. Scholarship programs with close follow-up of graduates may also help increase retention. ","625":"Globally, unmet need for postpartum family planning remains high, while immunization services are among the most wide-reaching and equitable interventions. Given overlapping time frames, integrating these services provides an opportunity to leverage existing health visits to offer women more comprehensive services. From March through November 2012, Liberia's government, with support from the Maternal and Child Health Integrated Program (MCHIP), piloted an integrated family planning and immunization model at 10 health facilities in Bong and Lofa counties. Vaccinators provided mothers bringing infants for routine immunization with targeted family planning and immunization messages and same-day referrals to co-located family planning services. In February 2013, we compared service statistics for family planning and immunization during the pilot against the previous year's statistics. We also conducted in-depth interviews with service providers and other personnel and focus group discussions with clients. Results showed that referral acceptance across the facilities varied from 10% to 45% per month, on average. Over 80% of referral acceptors completed the family planning visit that day, of whom over 90% accepted a contraceptive method that day. The total number of new contraceptive users at participating facilities increased by 73% in Bong and by 90% in Lofa. Women referred from immunization who accepted family planning that day accounted for 44% and 34% of total new contraceptive users in Bong and Lofa, respectively. In Lofa, pilot sites administered 35% more Penta 1 and 21% more Penta 3 doses during the pilot period compared with the same period of the previous year, while Penta 1 and Penta 3 administration decreased in non-pilot facilities. In Bong, there was little difference in the number of Penta 1 and Penta 3 doses administered between pilot and non-pilot facilities. In both counties, Penta 1 to Penta 3 dropout rates increased at pilot sites but not in non-pilot facilities, possibly due to higher than average background dropout rates at pilot sites prior to the intervention in Lofa and the disproportionate effect of data from 1 large facility in Bong. The project provided considerable basic support to assess this proof of concept. However, results suggest that introducing a simple model that is minimally disruptive to existing immunization service delivery can facilitate integration. The model is currently being scaled-up to other counties in Liberia, which could potentially contribute to increased postpartum contraceptive uptake, leading to longer birth intervals and improved health outcomes for children and mothers. ","626":"The impact of surgical conditions on global health, particularly on vulnerable populations, is gaining recognition. However, only 3.5% of the 234.2 million cases per year of major surgery are performed in countries where the world's poorest third reside, such as the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC). Data on the availability of anesthesia and surgical services were gathered from 12 DRC district hospitals using the World Health Organization's (WHO's) Emergency and Essential Surgical Care Situation Analysis Tool. We complemented these data with an analysis of the costs of surgical services in a Congolese norms-based district hospital as well as in 2 of the 12 hospitals in which we conducted the situational analysis (Demba and Kabare District Hospitals). For the cost analysis, we used WHO's integrated Healthcare Technology Package tool. Of the 32 surgical interventions surveyed, only 2 of the 12 hospitals provided all essential services. The deficits in procedures varied from no deficits to 17 services that could not be provided, with an average of 7 essential procedures unavailable. Many of the hospitals did not have basic infrastructure such as running water and electricity; 9 of 12 had no or interrupted water and 7 of 12 had no or interrupted electricity. On average, 21% of lifesaving surgical interventions were absent from the facilities, compared with the model normative hospital. According to the normative hospital, all surgical services would cost US$2.17 per inhabitant per year, representing 33.3% of the total patient caseload but only 18.3% of the total district hospital operating budget. At Demba Hospital, the operating budget required for surgical interventions was US$0.08 per inhabitant per year, and at Kabare Hospital, US$0.69 per inhabitant per year. A significant portion of the health problems addressed at Congolese district hospitals is surgical in nature, but there is a current inability to meet this surgical need. The deficient services and substandard capacity in the surveyed district hospitals are systemic in nature, representing infrastructure, supply, equipment, and human resource constraints. Yet surgical services are affordable and represent a minor portion of the total operating budget. Greater emphasis should be made to appropriately fund district hospitals to meet the need for lifesaving surgical services. ","627":"The method mix of contraceptive use is severely unbalanced in many countries, with over half of all use provided by just 1 or 2 methods. That tends to limit the range of user options and constrains the total prevalence of use, leading to unplanned pregnancies and births or abortions. Previous analyses of method mix distortions focused on countries where a single method accounted for more than half of all use (the 50% rule). We introduce a new measure that uses the average deviation (AD) of method shares around their own mean and apply that to a secondary analysis of method mix data for 8 contraceptive methods from 666 national surveys in 123 countries. A high AD value indicates a skewed method mix while a low AD value indicates a more uniform pattern across methods; the values can range from 0 to 21.9. Most AD values ranged from 6 to 19, with an interquartile range of 8.6 to 12.2. Using the AD measure, we identified 15 countries where the method mix has evolved from a distorted one to a better balanced one, with AD values declining, on average, by 35% over time. Countries show disparate paths in method gains and losses toward a balanced mix, but 4 patterns are suggested: (1) rise of one method partially offset by changes in other methods, (2) replacement of traditional with modern methods, (3) continued but declining domination by a single method, and (4) declines in dominant methods with increases in other methods toward a balanced mix. Regions differ markedly in their method mix profiles and preferences, raising the question of whether programmatic resources are best devoted to better provision of the well-accepted methods or to deploying neglected or new ones, or to a combination of both approaches. ","628":"An estimated 43 million women of reproductive age experienced the effects of conflict in 2012. Already vulnerable from the insecurity of the emergency, women must also face the continuing risk of unwanted pregnancy but often are unable to obtain family planning services. The ongoing Supporting Access to Family Planning and Post-Abortion Care (SAFPAC) initiative, led by CARE, has provided contraceptives, including long-acting reversible contraceptives (LARCs), to refugees, internally displaced persons, and conflict-affected resident populations in Chad, the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC), Djibouti, Mali, and Pakistan. The project works through the Ministry of Health in 4 key areas: (1) competency-based training, (2) supply chain management, (3) systematic supervision, and (4) community mobilization to raise awareness and shift norms related to family planning. This article presents data on program results from July 2011 to December 2013 from the 5 countries. Project staff summarized monthly data from client registers using hard-copy forms and recorded the data electronically in Microsoft Excel for compilation and analysis. The initiative reached 52,616 new users of modern contraceptive methods across the 5 countries, ranging from 575 in Djibouti to 21,191 in Chad. LARCs have predominated overall, representing 61% of new modern method users. The percentage of new users choosing LARCs varied by country: 78% in the DRC, 72% in Chad, and 51% in Mali, but only 29% in Pakistan. In Djibouti, those methods were not offered in the country through SAFPAC during the period discussed here. In Chad, the DRC, and Mali, implants have been the most popular LARC method, while in Pakistan the IUD has been more popular. Use of IUDs, however, has comprised a larger share of the method mix over time in all 4 of these countries. These results to date suggest that it is feasible to work with the public sector in fragile, crisis-affected states to deliver a wide range of quality family planning services, to do so rapidly, and to see a dramatic increase in the percentage of users choosing long-acting reversible methods. ","629":"In 2012, about 43 million women of reproductive age experienced the effects of conflict. Provision of basic sexual and reproductive health services, including family planning, is a recognized right and need of refugees and internally displaced people, but funding and services for family planning have been inadequate. This article describes lessons learned during the first 2.5 years of implementing the ongoing Supporting Access to Family Planning and Post-Abortion Care in Emergencies (SAFPAC) initiative, led by CARE, which supports government health systems to deliver family planning services in 5 crisis-affected settings (Chad, Democratic Republic of the Congo, Djibouti, Mali, and Pakistan). SAFPAC's strategy focuses on 4 broad interventions drawn from public health best practices in more stable settings: competency-based training for providers, improved supply chain management, regular supervision, and community mobilization to influence attitudes and norms related to family planning. Between July 2011 and December 2013, the initiative reached 52,616 new users of modern contraceptive methods across the 5 countries (catchment population of 698,053 women of reproductive age), 61% of whom chose long-acting methods of implants or intrauterine devices. Prudent use of data to inform decision making has been an underpinning to the project's approach. A key approach to ensuring sustained ability to train and supervise new providers has been to build capacity in clinical skills training and supervision by establishing in-country training centers. In addition, monthly supervision using simple checklists has improved program and service quality, particularly with infection prevention procedures and stock management. We have generally instituted a \"pull\" system to manage commodities and other supplies, whereby health facilities place resupply orders as needed based on actual consumption patterns and stock-alert thresholds. Finally, reaching the community with mobilization efforts appropriate to the cultural context has been integral to meeting unmet family planning needs rapidly in these crisis-affected settings. Despite the constraints in crisis-affected countries, such as travel difficulties due to security issues, in our experience, we have been able to extend access to a range of contraceptive methods, including long-acting reversible contraceptives, in such settings using best practice approaches established in more stable environments.

Training and supporting drug shop and pharmacy staff to provide a wide range of contraceptive methods and information is a promising high-impact practice for which more information is needed to fully document implementation experience and impact. Between September 2010 and March 2011, we trained 139 drug shop operators (DSOs) in 4 districts of Uganda to safely administer intramuscular DMPA (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) contraceptive injections. In 2012, we approached 54 of these DSOs and interviewed a convenience sample of 585 of their family planning clients to assess clients' contraceptive use and perspectives on the quality of care and satisfaction with services. Finally, we compared service statistics from April to June 2011 from drug shops, community health workers (CHWs), and government clinics in 3 districts to determine the drug shop market share of family planning services. Most drug shop family planning clients interviewed were women with low socioeconomic status. The large majority (89%) were continuing family planning users. DMPA was the preferred contraceptive. Almost half of the drug shop clients had switched from other providers, primarily from government health clinics, mostly as a result of more convenient locations, shorter waiting times, and fewer stock-outs in drug shops. All clients reported that the DSOs treated them respectfully, and 93% trusted the drug shop operator to maintain privacy. Three-quarters felt that drug shops offered affordable family planning services. Most of the DMPA clients (74%) were very satisfied with receiving their method from the drug shop and 98% intended to get the next injection from the drug shop. Between April and June 2011, clinics, CHWs, and drug shops in 3 districts delivered equivalent proportions of couple-years of protection, with drug shops leading marginally at 36%, followed by clinics (33%) and CHWs (31%). Drug shops can be a viable and convenient source of short-acting contraceptive methods, including DMPA, serving as a complement to government services. Family planning programs in Uganda and elsewhere should consider including drug shops in the network of community-based family planning providers. ","635":"More than 40 million women use injectable contraceptives to prevent pregnancy, and most current or previous injectable users report being satisfied with the method. However, while women may find injectables acceptable, they may not always find them accessible due to stock-outs and difficulties with returning to the clinic for reinjections. FHI 360 is spearheading efforts to develop a longer-acting injectable (LAI) contraceptive that could provide at least 6 months of protection against pregnancy. This article addresses systems-level considerations for the introduction of a new LAI. We conducted qualitative case studies in Kenya and Rwanda-two countries that have high levels of injectable use but with different service delivery contexts. Between June and September 2012, we conducted in-depth interviews with 27 service providers and 19 policy makers and program implementers focusing on 4 themes: systems-level barriers and facilitators to delivering LAI services; process for introducing an LAI; LAI distribution approaches; and potential LAI characteristics. We also obtained electronic feedback from 28 international family planning opinion leaders. Respondents indicated strong interest in an LAI and thought it would appeal to existing injectable users as well as new family planning clients, both for spacing and for limiting births. Providers appreciated the potential for a lighter workload due to fewer follow-up visits, but they were concerned that fewer visits would also decrease their ability to help women manage side effects. The providers also appreciated the 1-month grace period for follow-up LAI injections; some seemed unaware of the latest international guidance that had increased the grace period from 2 weeks to 4 weeks for the currently available 3-month injectable. The majority of policy makers and program implementers were supportive of letting community health workers provide the method, but many nurses and midwives in Kenya had reservations about the approach. At the policy level, respondents indicated that obtaining regulatory approvals before introducing the new method could be costly and time-consuming. Manufacturing and procurement decisions could also affect cost and availability. Successful introduction of a potential longer-acting injectable may be enhanced by considering broader systemic issues, including managing cost to the health system and users, expanding access through community-based distribution, and training providers on the latest service delivery guidelines. ","636":"Scaling up HIV prevention programming among key populations (female sex workers and men who have sex with men) has been a central strategy of the Government of India. However, state governments have lacked the technical and managerial capacity to oversee and scale up interventions or to absorb donor-funded programs. In response, the national government contracted Technical Support Units (TSUs), teams with expertise from the private and nongovernmental sectors, to collaborate with and assist state governments. In 2008, a TSU was established in Karnataka, one of 6 Indian states with the highest HIV prevalence in the country and where monitoring showed that its prevention programs were reaching only 5% of key populations. The TSU provided support to the state in 5 key areas: assisting in strategic planning, rolling out a comprehensive monitoring and evaluation system, providing supportive supervision to intervention units, facilitating training, and assisting with information, education, and communication activities. This collaborative management model helped to increase capacity of the state, enabling it to take over funding and oversight of HIV prevention programs previously funded through donors. With the combined efforts of the TSU and the state government, the number of intervention units statewide increased from 40 to 126 between 2009 and 2013. Monthly contacts with female sex workers increased from 5% in 2008 to 88% in 2012, and with men who have sex with men, from 36% in 2009 to 81% in 2012. There were also increases in the proportion of both populations who visited HIV testing and counseling centers (from 3% to 47% among female sex workers and from 6% to 33% among men who have sex with men) and sexually transmitted infection clinics (from 4% to 75% among female sex workers and from 7% to 67% among men who have sex with men). Changes in sexual behaviors among key populations were also documented. For example, between 2008 and 2010, the proportion of surveyed female sex workers in 9 districts reporting that they used a condom at last intercourse rose from 60% to 68%; in 6 districts, the proportion of surveyed men who have sex with men reporting that they used a condom at last anal sex increased from 89% to 97%. The Karnataka experience suggests that TSUs can help governments enhance managerial and technical resources and leverage funds more effectively. With careful management of the working and reporting relationships between the TSU and the state government, this additional capacity can pave the way for the government to improve and scale up programs and to absorb previously donor-funded programs. ","637":"The Nigerian Urban Reproductive Health Initiative (NURHI), a 6-year comprehensive family planning program (2009-2015) in 4 cities, intentionally applies communication theories to all program elements, not just the demand generation ones, relying mainly on a theory called ideation-the concept that contraceptive use is influenced by people's beliefs, ideas, and feelings and that changing these ideational factors can change people's behavior. The project used multiple communication channels to foster dialogue about family planning, increase social approval for it, and improve accurate knowledge about contraceptives. Mobile service delivery was started in the third year to improve access to clinical methods in slums. Data from representative baseline (2010-11) and midterm (2012) surveys of women of reproductive age in the project cities were analyzed. We also used propensity score matching to create a statistically equivalent control group of women not exposed to project activities, and we examined service delivery data from NURHI-supported clinics (January 2011-May 2013) to determine the contribution of mobile services to total family planning services. Three years into the initiative, analysis of longitudinal data shows that use of modern contraceptives has increased in each city, varying from 2.3 to 15.5 percentage points, and that the observed increases were predicted by exposure to NURHI activities. Of note is that modern method use increased substantially among the poorest wealth quintiles in project cities, on average, by 8.4 percentage points. The more project activities women were exposed to, the greater their contraceptive use. For example, among women not using a modern method at baseline, contraceptive prevalence among those with no exposure by midterm was 19.1% vs. 43.4% among those with high exposure. Project exposure had a positive dose-response relationship with ideation, as did ideation and contraceptive use. By the end of the observation period, mobile services were contributing nearly 50% of total family planning services provided through NURHI-supported clinics. Propensity score matching found that the increase in contraceptive use in the 4 cities attributable to project exposure was 9.9 percentage points. Intention to use family planning in the next 12 months also increased by 7.5 to 10.2 percentage points across the 4 cities. Demand-led family planning programs, in which demand generation is the driving force behind the design rather than the conventional, service delivery-oriented approach, may be more suitable in places where expressed demand for contraceptives is low. ","638":"Family planning is crucial for preventing unintended pregnancies and for improving maternal and child health and well-being. In urban areas where there are large inequities in family planning use, particularly among the urban poor, programs are needed to increase access to and use of contraception among those most in need. This paper presents the midterm evaluation findings of the Urban Reproductive Health Initiative (Urban RH Initiative) programs, funded by the Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation, that are being implemented in 4 countries: India (Uttar Pradesh), Kenya, Nigeria, and Senegal. Between 2010 and 2013, the Measurement, Learning &amp; Evaluation (MLE) project collected baseline and 2-year longitudinal follow-up data from women in target study cities to examine the role of demand generation activities undertaken as part of the Urban RH Initiative programs. Evaluation results demonstrate that, in each country where it was measured, outreach by community health or family planning workers as well as local radio programs were significantly associated with increased use of modern contraceptive methods. In addition, in India and Nigeria, television programs had a significant effect on modern contraceptive use, and in Kenya and Nigeria, the program slogans and materials that were blanketed across the cities (eg, leaflets\/brochures distributed at health clinics and the program logo placed on all forms of materials, from market umbrellas to health facility signs and television programs) were also significantly associated with modern method use. Our results show that targeted, multilevel demand generation activities can make an important contribution to increasing modern contraceptive use in urban areas and could impact Millennium Development Goals for improved maternal and child health and access to reproductive health for all.

In project districts, Kabeho Mwana staff also trained CHWs to conduct household-level health promotion and established supervision and reporting mechanisms through CHW peer support groups (PSGs) and quality improvement systems.

We developed a logit regression model, controlling for the timing of the first CHW training, with the district included as a fixed categorical effect. We also analyzed qualitative data from the final evaluation to examine factors that may have contributed to improved outcomes. While there was notable improvement in care-seeking across all districts, care-seeking from any provider for each of the 3 conditions, and for all 3 combined, increased significantly more in the project districts. CHWs contributed a larger percentage of consultations in project districts (27%) than in non-project districts (12%). Qualitative data suggested that the PSG model was a valuable sub-level of CHW organization associated with improved CHW performance, supervision, and social capital. The iCCM model implemented by Kabeho Mwana resulted in greater improvements in care-seeking than those seen in the rest of the country. Intensive monitoring, collaborative supervision, community mobilization, and CHW PSGs contributed to this success. The PSGs were a unique contribution of the project, playing a critical role in improving care-seeking in project districts. Effective implementation of iCCM should therefore include CHW management and social support mechanisms. Finally, re-analysis of national survey data improved evaluation findings by providing impact estimates.

Nongovernmental organizations (NGOs) introduced VIA to Guatemala in 2004, and a growing number of NGOs, working both independently and in collaboration with the Guatemalan Ministry of Health, employ VIA in cervical cancer prevention programs today. While much research describes VIA efficacy and feasibility in Latin America, little is known about NGO involvement with VIA programming or experiences with VIA outside the context of clinical trials and pilot projects in the region. To explore challenges faced by NGOs implementing VIA programs in Guatemala, we conducted semi-structured interviews with 36 NGO staff members involved with 20 VIA programs as direct service providers, program administrators, and training course instructors. Additionally, we collected data through observation at 30 NGO-sponsored cervical cancer screening campaigns, 8 cervical cancer prevention conferences, and 1 week-long NGO-sponsored VIA training course. Frequently highlighted challenges included staff turnover, concerns over training quality, a need for opportunities for continued supervision, and problems with cryotherapy referrals when immediate treatment for VIA-positive women was unavailable. Reducing staff turnover, budgeting to train replacement providers, standardizing training curricula, and offering continued supervision are key strategies to improve VIA service quality and program sustainability. Alternative training methods, such as on-the-job mentoring and course prerequisites of online learning, could help increase training time available for clinical supervision. Efforts should be made to ensure that VIA testing is coupled with immediate cryotherapy, that providers trained in VIA are also trained in cryotherapy, and that cryotherapy supplies and equipment are maintained. Where this is not possible and only VIA screening is available, referral systems must be strengthened. ","653":"Public-sector entities responsible for procurement of essential medicines and health commodities in developing countries often lack the technical capacity to efficiently ensure supply security. Under strict public scrutiny and pressures to be transparent, many agencies continue to use archaic procurement methods and to depend on inflexible forecasts and cumbersome tendering processes. On the basis of semi-structured literature reviews and interviews, we identified framework agreements as a strategic procurement practice used by the U.S. federal government that may also be suitable for global health supply chains. Framework agreements are long-term contracts that provide the terms and conditions under which smaller repeat purchasing orders may be issued for a defined period of time. Such agreements are common in U.S. and United Nations procurement systems and in other developed countries and multilateral organizations. In contrast, framework agreements appear to be seldom used in procurement of health commodities in countries of sub-Saharan Africa. The current practice of floating tenders multiple times a year contributes to long lead times and stock-outs, and it hampers the manufacturer's or supplier's ability to plan and respond to the government's needs. To date, government's use of strategic contracting practices in public procurement of health commodities has not received much attention in most developing countries. It may present an opportunity for substantial improvements in procurement efficiency and commodity availability. Enabling legislation and strengthened technical capacity to develop and manage long-term contracts could facilitate the use of framework contracts in sub-Saharan Africa, with improved supply security and cost savings likely to result.

In 2012, a key informant survey was conducted to identify both national and global gaps in PPH and PE\/E program priorities and to highlight focus areas for future national and global programming. Between January and March 2012, national program teams in 37 countries completed a 44-item survey, consisting mostly of dichotomous yes\/no responses and addressing 6 core programmatic areas: policy, training, medication distribution and logistics, national reporting of key indicators, programming, and challenges to and opportunities for scale up. An in-country focal person led the process to gather the necessary information from key local stakeholders. Some countries also provided national essential medicines lists and service delivery guidelines for comparison and further analysis. Most surveyed countries have many elements in place to address PPH and PE\/E, but notable gaps remain in both policy and practice. Oxytocin and magnesium sulfate were reported to be regularly available in facilities in 89% and 76% of countries, respectively. Only 27% of countries, however, noted regular availability of misoprostol in health facilities. Midwife scope of practice regarding PPH and PE\/E is inconsistent with global norms in a number of countries: 22% of countries do not allow midwives to administer magnesium sulfate and 30% do not allow them to perform manual removal of the placenta. Most countries surveyed have many of the essential policies and program elements to prevent\/manage PPH and PE\/E, but absence of commodities (especially misoprostol), limitations in scope of practice for midwives, and gaps in inclusion of maternal health indicators in the national data systems have impeded efforts to scale up programs nationally.

","660":"Contraceptive use in Senegal is among the lowest in the world and has barely increased over the past 5 years, from 10% of married women in 2005 to 12% in 2011. Contraceptive stockouts in public facilities, where 85% of women access family planning services, are common. In 2011, we conducted a supply chain study of 33 public-sector facilities in Pikine and Guediawaye districts of the Dakar region to understand the magnitude and root causes of stockouts. The study included stock audits, surveys with 156 consumers, and interviews with facility staff, managers, and other stakeholders. At the facility level, stockouts of injectables and implants occurred, on average, 43% and 83% of the year, respectively. At least 60% of stockouts occurred despite stock availability at the national level. Data from interviews revealed that the current \"pull-based\" distribution system was complex and inefficient. In order to reduce stockout rates to the commercial-sector standard of 2% or less, the Government of Senegal and the Senegal Urban Reproductive Health Initiative developed the informed push distribution model (IPM) and pilot-tested it in Pikine district between February 2012 and July 2012. IPM brings the source of supply (a delivery truck loaded with supplies) closer to the source of demand (clients in health facilities) and streamlines the steps in between. With a professional logistician managing stock and deliveries, the health facilities no longer need to place and pick up orders. Stockouts of contraceptive pills, injectables, implants, and intrauterine devices (IUDs) were completely eliminated at the 14 public health facilities in Pikine over the 6-month pilot phase. The government expanded IPM to all 140 public facilities in the Dakar region, and 6 months later stockout rates throughout the region dropped to less than 2%. National coverage of the IPM is expected by July 2015. ","661":"There is no guarantee that a successful pilot program introducing a reproductive health innovation can also be expanded successfully to the national or regional level, because the scaling-up process is complex and multilayered. This article describes how a successful pilot program to integrate the Standard Days Method (SDM) of family planning into existing Ministry of Health services was scaled up nationally in Rwanda. Much of the success of the scale-up effort was due to systematic use of monitoring and evaluation (M&amp;E) data from several sources to make midcourse corrections. Four lessons learned illustrate this crucially important approach. First, ongoing M&amp;E data showed that provider training protocols and client materials that worked in the pilot phase did not work at scale; therefore, we simplified these materials to support integration into the national program. Second, triangulation of ongoing monitoring data with national health facility and population-based surveys revealed serious problems in supply chain mechanisms that affected SDM (and the accompanying CycleBeads client tool) availability and use; new procedures for ordering supplies and monitoring stockouts were instituted at the facility level. Third, supervision reports and special studies revealed that providers were imposing unnecessary medical barriers to SDM use; refresher training and revised supervision protocols improved provider practices. Finally, informal environmental scans, stakeholder interviews, and key events timelines identified shifting political and health policy environments that influenced scale-up outcomes; ongoing advocacy efforts are addressing these issues. The SDM scale-up experience in Rwanda confirms the importance of monitoring and evaluating programmatic efforts continuously, using a variety of data sources, to improve program outcomes. ","662":"To address low contraceptive use in Afghanistan, we supported 2 large public maternity hospitals and 3 private hospitals in Kabul to use modern quality improvement (QI) methods to integrate family planning into postpartum care. In 2012, QI teams comprising hospital staff applied root cause analysis to identify barriers to integrated postpartum family planning (PPFP) services and to develop solutions for how to integrate services. Changes made to service provision to address identified barriers included creating a private counseling space near the postpartum ward, providing PPFP counseling training and job aids to staff, and involving husbands and mothers-in-law in counseling in person or via mobile phones. After 10 months, the proportion of postpartum women who received family planning counseling before discharge in the 5 hospitals increased from 36% to 55%, and the proportion of women who received family planning counseling with their husbands rose from 18% to 90%. In addition, the proportion of postpartum women who agreed to use family planning and left the hospital with their preferred method increased from 12% to 95%. Follow-up telephone surveys with a random sample of women who had received PPFP services in the 2 public hospitals and a control group of postpartum women who had received routine hospital services found significant differences in the proportion of women with self-reported pregnancies: 3% vs. 15%, respectively, 6 months after discharge; 6% vs. 22% at 12 months; and 14% vs. 35% at 18 months (P &lt; .001).

","663":null,"664":"Some medical doctors in India have publicly expressed opposition to making emergency contraceptive pills (ECPs) easily accessible, even though ECPs are included in the method mix of the Ministry of Health and Family Welfare program and as an over-the-counter (OTC) product. Such opposition affects access to ECPs by influencing policy, procurement, and distribution, besides stigmatizing the ECP user. This study was conducted to assess ECP knowledge, attitudes, and practices of doctors in North India. A cross-sectional survey of 83 doctors who provide ECPs, randomly selected from 3 cities in the state of Uttar Pradesh, was conducted in 2011. The quantitative data were complemented by 19 in-depth interviews with purposively selected senior gynecologists and other opinion leaders. All surveyed physicians cited the correct dose and regimen for ECPs. However, the large majority of those surveyed believed that ECPs work by preventing implantation. (The best evidence currently indicates that ECPs do not work by preventing implantation.) Most doctors also believed incorrectly that ECPs have several contraindications and side effects. They also had strong reservations against OTC provision of ECPs by pharmacists and community health workers (CHWs) and negative attitudes toward ECP users, which serve as serious medical barriers to mainstreaming use of ECPs. Physicians and their professional associations exert a strong influence on the operationalization of national contraceptive policies. Evidence-based advocacy and educational campaigns targeting doctors are needed to address and resolve their reservations about ECPs, particularly about its provision as an OTC product and its distribution by CHWs. Partnerships with medical associations can help reduce doctors' negative attitudes and create a conducive environment for influencing clinical practices. Such changes are needed to increase the availability and use of ECPs as part of a package of a full range of contraceptive method options to prevent unwanted pregnancy among the most vulnerable populations. ","665":null,"666":"Between 1995 and 2005, injectable use doubled worldwide. However, discontinuation rates remain high, partly because of side effects but also because of missed appointments for reinjection. A longer-acting injectable (LAI) may improve compliance by reducing the required number of reinjection visits, thereby reducing unintentional discontinuation. This study examined acceptability of LAI characteristics comprising the target product profile (TPP). In 2012, we conducted qualitative case studies in Kenya and Rwanda, consisting of 19 focus group discussions (FGDs) with 177 current, previous, or never users of injectables and 46 in-depth interviews (IDIs) with providers, program implementers, and policy makers. FGDs and IDIs assessed current injectable experiences; attitudes toward potential LAI products; and perceptions of TPP attributes, including ranking preferences for the most and least important characteristics. In addition, we obtained completed electronic surveys from 28 international family planning opinion leaders about the perceived need for an LAI, important product characteristics, and challenges to LAI development or introduction. Many FGD participants and interviewees spontaneously expressed strong interest in an LAI, but there was some variation in TPP preferences. The majority of participants ranked effectiveness as the most important TPP attribute. Providers were generally more concerned about side effects than potential users; some potential users suggested that side effects were related less to the product than to their own body chemistry and that side effects were acceptable as long as they did not last a long time or disrupt daily activities. Women and providers, especially in Kenya, preferred a method with a predictable return to fertility. Some participants associated amenorrhea with delayed or reduced fertility. Most women and providers preferred delivery of the LAI in a single, prepackaged, disposable injection system to facilitate injections by providers and to reduce the risk of pain or discomfort for women. While providers and policy makers ranked cost as one of the most important issues, it was among the least important issues for most potential users. Many Kenyan, but few Rwandan, participants appeared willing to pay for an LAI, with some presuming cost savings from reduced menstruation and fewer clinic visits. Some TPP preferences for an LAI have implications for product development decisions about formulation, delivery mechanism, or presentation, while others point to the need for tailored communication and counseling approaches to ensure acceptability and adherence within clinical trials and beyond.

The World Health Organization has recommended priority interventions for malaria during pregnancy, including use of insecticide-treated nets (ITNs), but net distribution has shifted recently to a universal coverage paradigm rather than one targeting vulnerable populations. To determine whether and to what extent pregnant women are prioritized within the household for ITN use, we assessed national survey data from 2009-2013 in 10 African countries. Proportion of pregnant women who slept under an ITN the previous night and 95% confidence intervals were calculated and compared between countries. Within-country logistic regression examined whether pregnancy was significantly associated with ITN use the previous night compared with other risk groups, and the predicted probability of net use for each risk group was calculated holding other covariates constant. A median 58% of households reported owning at least 1 ITN. On average, across all 10 countries, 35% of pregnant women in households with at least 1 ITN used a net. Households with universal coverage (at least 1 ITN per 2 people) had higher levels of net use among all family members; for example, 79% of pregnant women, on average, used a net in such households. In all countries, the predicted probability of ITN use by pregnant women was significantly higher than the probability of net use by most other household members except non-pregnant women of reproductive age. These findings suggest that both pregnant women and non-pregnant women of reproductive age are being prioritized within the household for net use. However, behavior change communication strategies are needed to achieve ITN use goals for pregnant women.

We used a mixed-methods case-study design, combining semi-structured interviews with 31 key informants, a survey among 18 health facilities, and analysis of routine health facility data on number of routine vaccinations and antenatal consultations before, during, and after the MenA vaccine campaign in December 2010. Survey and interview data were collected at the national level and in 2 regions in July and August 2011, with additional interviews in January 2012. Many health system functions were not affected-either positively or negatively-by the MenA vaccine introduction. The majority of effects were felt on the immunization program. Benefits included strengthened communication and social mobilization, surveillance, and provider skills. Drawbacks included the interruption of routine vaccination services in the majority of health facilities surveyed (67%). The average daily number of children receiving routine vaccinations was 79% to 87% lower during the 10-day campaign period than during other periods of the month. Antenatal care consultations were also reduced during the campaign period by 10% to 15%. Key informants argued that, with an average of 14 campaigns per year, mass campaigns would have a substantial cumulative negative effect on routine health services. Many also argued that the MenA campaign missed potential opportunities for health systems strengthening because integration with other health services was lacking. The MenA vaccine introduction interrupted routine vaccination and other health services.

Data were collected between July and August 2011, and sources comprised 183 surveys with active CHWs, in-depth interviews (IDIs) with 43 active CHWs and 5 former CHWs, and service statistics records. Surveys included a discrete choice experiment (DCE) to elicit CHW preferences for selected program inputs. Service statistics indicated an average of 56 visits with family planning clients per surveyed CHW over the 3-month period prior to data collection. In the survey, new skills and knowledge, perceived impact on the community, and enhanced status were the main positive aspects of the job reported by CHWs; the main challenges related to transportation. Multivariate analyses identified 2 correlates of CHWs being highly vs. less active (in terms of number of client visits): experiencing problems with supplies and not collaborating with peers. DCE results showed that provision of a package including a T-shirt, badge, and bicycle was the program input CHWs preferred, followed by a mobile phone (without airtime). IDI data reinforced and supplemented these quantitative findings. Social prestige, social responsibility, and aspirations for other opportunities were important motivators, while main challenges related to transportation and commodity stockouts. CHWs had complex motivations for wanting better compensation, including offsetting time and transportation costs, providing for their families, and feeling appreciated for their efforts. Volunteer CHW programs in Uganda and elsewhere need to carefully consider appropriate combinations of financial and nonfinancial inputs for optimal results.

Marie Stopes International (MSI) offers implants as one of many family planning options. Between 2008 and 2012, MSI scaled up voluntary access to implants in 15 sub-Saharan African countries, from 80,041 implants in 2008 to 754,329 implants in 2012. This 9-fold increase amounted to more than 1.7 million implants delivered cumulatively over the 5-year period. High levels of client satisfaction were attained alongside service provision scale up by using existing MSI service delivery channels-mobile outreach, social franchising, and clinics-to implement strategies that broadened access for underserved clients and maintained service quality. Use of adaptive and context-specific service delivery models and attention to key operational components, including sufficient numbers of trained providers, strong supply chains, diverse financing mechanisms, and implant removal services, underpinned our service delivery efforts. Accounting for 70% of the implants delivered by MSI in 2012, mobile outreach services through dedicated MSI provider teams played a central role in scale-up efforts, fueled in part by the provision of free or heavily subsidized services. Social franchising also demonstrated promise for future program growth, along with MSI clinics. Continued high growth in implant provision between 2011 and 2012 in all sub-Saharan African countries indicates the region's capacity for further service delivery expansion. Meeting the expected rising demand for implants and ensuring long-term sustainable access to the method, as part of a comprehensive method mix, will require continued use of appropriate service delivery models, effective operations, and ongoing collaboration between the private, public, and nongovernmental sectors.

Data were collected between 2009 and 2011 and analyzed across 8 MIP health systems components: (1) integration of programs and services, (2) policy, (3) commodities, (4) quality assurance, (5) capacity building, (6) community involvement, (7) monitoring and evaluation, and (8) financing. Within each program area, we ranked degree of scale up across 4 stages and synthesized the findings in a MIP table of analysis to reveal common themes related to better practices, remaining bottlenecks, and opportunities to accelerate MIP coverage, strengthen MIP programs, and improve results. Each of the 3 countries has malaria policies in place that reflect current MIP guidance from the World Health Organization. The 3 countries successfully integrated MIP interventions into a platform of antenatal care services, but coordination at the national level was disjointed. All 3 countries recognized the importance of having a MIP focal person to ensure collaboration and planning at the national level, but only Malawi had appointed one. Commodity stockouts were frequent due to problems at all levels of the logistics system, from quantification to distribution. Lack of support for quality assurance and weak monitoring and evaluation mechanisms across all 3 countries affected optimal coverage.

A pilot project, implemented in 2 rural districts of Malawi between 2010 and 2011, introduced a mobile phone system to strengthen knowledge exchange within networks of CHWs and district staff. To evaluate the mobile phone intervention, a participatory evaluation method called Net-Map was used, an approach built on traditional social network analysis. Together, CHWs and district personnel discussed information needs and gaps and the roles of different actors in their information networks. They then used drawings and 3-dimensional objects to create baseline and endline maps showing the linkages and levels of influence among members of the information network. Net-Map provided them with powerful evidence of differences before and after the mobile phone initiative. At baseline, CHWs were not mentioned as actors in the information network, while at endline they were seen to have significant connections with colleagues, beneficiaries, supervisors, and district health facilities, as both recipients and providers of information. Focus groups with CHWs complemented the Net-Map findings with reports of increased self-confidence and greater trust by their communities. These qualitative results were bolstered by surveys that showed decreases in stockouts of essential medicines, lower communication costs, wider service coverage, and more efficient referrals.

The main reasons for low vaccination rates in urban Dili included caregivers' knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions as well as barriers at immunization service sites. Other important factors were access to services and information, particularly in the city periphery, health workers' attitudes and practices, caregivers' fears of side effects, conflicting priorities, large family size, lack of support from husbands and paternal grandmothers, and seasonal migration. Good access to health facilities or health services does not necessarily translate into uptake of immunization services.

Between July 2008 and June 2009, the program trained 1,683 FCHVs from 6 districts on how to provide UPTs and appropriate counseling and referral; 1,492 FCHVs (89%) provided follow-up data on the number of clients served and the type of services provided. In addition, the program conducted in-depth interviews with selected FCHVs and other reproductive health service providers on their perceptions of the program. Of the FCHVs with follow-up data, 80% reported providing UPTs to women in the 8-month follow-up period. In total, they conducted 4,598 UPTs, with a mean number of 3.1 tests per FCHV. Among the women with a negative pregnancy test (47%), FCHVs provided 24% of them with oral contraceptive pills and 20% with condoms; referred 10% for other contraceptive services; and provided contraceptive counseling only to 46%. Among the women with positive pregnancy tests (53%), FCHVs referred 68% for antenatal care and 32% for safe abortion services. Providing FCHVs with the skills and supplies required for early pregnancy detection allowed them to make referrals for appropriate reproductive health services. Results of this evaluation suggest that community health workers such as FCHVs are a promising channel for early pregnancy detection and referral. As the intervention is scaled up, the focus should be on ensuring service availability and awareness of available services, UPT supply, and creating viable options for record keeping. ","693":"For many developing countries, obesity and its sequelae have become a challenge of a magnitude similar to hunger and undernutrition. The main objective of this study was, therefore, to investigate the weight status of women in rural Tanzania with reference to season as well as the link between women's weight, food consumption, and attitudes toward obesity. Three cross-sectional surveys in 3 different seasons within 1 year interviewed the same 210 women, ages 17-45 years, from 3 rural districts of northeastern and central Tanzania. These surveys assessed body mass index (BMI), food intake, and dietary diversity through 24-hour recalls, women's attitudes toward obesity, vegetable production, and socioeconomic status. Although 71% of the women had a normal BMI, 7% were underweight, 16% overweight, and 6% obese. The BMI was correlated with the Dietary Diversity Score (DDS), the Food Variety Score (FVS), with the consumption of foods from the food groups \"bread\/cakes,\" \"sugar,\" and \"tea,\" and with the production of exotic vegetables. In a multiple regression model, FVS was directly associated with BMI. When asked to describe the typical characteristics of an obese person, women mentioned more negative than positive characteristics. The prevalence of overweight and obesity was 3 times higher than that of underweight. Apparently, even in rural areas of Tanzania, a nutrition transition is underway. No direct association was identified between vegetable consumption and BMI. Although this study did not assess behavioral factors, such behavioral factors as activity levels as well as attitudes need to be considered, even in rural settings, to address all facets of malnutrition. ","694":"Developing effective context-specific strategies to ensure that a high proportion of children receive timely and appropriate care requires knowing the source from which care is sought. Although Demographic and Health Surveys (DHS) and Multiple Indicator Cluster Surveys (MICS) collect such data in disaggregated form, they are not made available in the standard DHS and MICS reports. Secondary data analysis was done on 42 DHS and MICS surveys conducted since 2005 for care seeking for acute respiratory illness (DHS and MICS), diarrhea (DHS only), and fever (DHS only), disaggregating by urban-rural settings. Eight categories were used for source of care. Stata, version 12, was used for the analysis. Patterns varied considerably, with care seeking in most of sub-Saharan Africa predominantly from public-sector providers, in South Asia predominantly from the private sector, and in Southeast Asia from a mix of public and private sources. Community health workers were not an important source of care. Variation in care-seeking patterns has implications for effective strategy, as described in more detail in 5 country examples from Asia and Africa. The analysis also suggests that it may be inappropriate to focus program efforts on community health workers to the exclusion of more widely used sources of care. The authors argue that, in order to ensure sounder program approaches, disaggregated care-seeking data should be routinely included in DHS and MICS reports. Finally, the authors call for more data on actual care provided in order to improve quality of care. ","695":"A critical shortage of doctors, nurses, and midwives in many sub-Saharan African countries inhibits efforts to expand access to family planning services, especially in rural areas. One way to fill this gap is for community health workers (CHWs) to provide injectable contraceptives, an intervention for which there is growing evidence and international support. In 2009, with approval from the Government of Zambia (GoZ), FHI 360 collaborated with ChildFund Zambia to design and implement such an intervention as part of its existing CHW family planning program. The safety of CHW provision of injectable DMPA (depot medroxyprogesterone acetate) was measured by client reports and by a 21-item structured observation checklist. Feasibility and acceptability were measured by interviews with CHWs and a subset of DMPA clients. The impact of adding DMPA to pill and condom provision was assessed by family planning uptake among the clients of trained CHWs from February 2010 to February 2011. Costs were documented using spreadsheets over the period November 2009 to February 2011. Scores were high on all measures of safety, feasibility, and acceptability. Couple-years of protection (CYP, protection from pregnancy for 1 year) was provided to 51 condom clients, 391 pill clients, and 2,206 DMPA clients. Of the 1,739 clients new to family planning, 85% chose injectable DMPA, while 13% chose pills and 2% chose condoms. Continuation rates were also high, at 63% after 1 year as compared with 47% for pill users. Incremental costs per couple-year were US$21.24 if 50% of users continue with CHW-provided DMPA. The study affirms that the provision of injectable contraceptives by CHWs is safe, acceptable, and feasible in the Zambian context, with very high rates of uptake in hard-to-reach areas. High continuation rates among clients mean that costs of the intervention can be low when added to an existing community-based distribution program-a finding that is relevant to program replication (now underway in Zambia). ","696":"In rural areas of Kenya, where the majority of Kenya's population lives, contraceptive use remains low compared with that in urban areas (37% vs. 47%). Inadequate access to family planning services in rural areas is partly due to fewer health facilities and the shortage of health care workers. Community-based access to injectable contraceptives can improve access for rural populations and expand the range of contraceptive methods available. Our pilot project sought to generate local evidence on safety, feasibility, and acceptability of the provision of injectable depot medroxyprogesterone acetate (DMPA) by community health workers (CHWs). We trained 31 CHWs in Tharaka District to provide injectable DMPA in addition to pills and condoms. Data were collected on family planning clients served by CHWs in Tharaka District as well as those who received services from health facilities from August 2009 to September 2010. Service statistics were collected from 3 pilot health facilities in the CHW service catchment area. In the 12-month study period, CHWs reached 1,210 women with family planning services including referrals for long-acting and permanent methods. Family planning use in the pilot sites for all methods increased an estimated fivefold, from 9% in facilities to 46% when facilities and CHWs were combined (32% for CHWs and 14% for facilities). The majority (69%) of clients served by CHWs chose DMPA. No client reported any signs of infection at the injection site nor did any CHW report needlestick injuries or other adverse events. The re-injection rate was 68% at the third visit, which compares favorably with other DMPA continuation studies. Two main reasons given for discontinuing were change of residence and temporary separation from spouse. Community-based provision of DMPA along with other contraceptive methods increased the use of family planning and improved method choice during the study period. Injectable contraception provided by trained CHWs is a safe, acceptable, and feasible service delivery option in Kenya. ","697":"Pursuing true country ownership for effective programs requires a long-term approach involving persistence, patience, keen understanding of counterparts' perspective, deference, building trust, focus on priorities, technical competence, and sustained optimism. ","698":"Despite their vital role, routine immunization programs are taken for granted. Coverage levels are poor in some countries and have stagnated in others, while addition of new vaccines is an additional stressor. We need to strengthen: (1) policy processes, (2) monitoring and evaluation, (3) human resources, (4) regular delivery and supply systems, (5) local political commitment and ownership, (6) involvement of civil society and communities, and (7) sustainable financing. Rebalancing immunization direction and investment is needed. ","699":"Barriers to access and quality, such as long waits, disrespectful provider behavior, and medical barriers, continue to constrain health programs. Reducing them further requires a multipronged management approach that includes understanding and addressing provider behavior and the real problems providers face. ","700":"As PEPFAR moves beyond its \"emergency stage,\" it should now help support a more sustainable development mode, including an equitable platform for meeting a broad range of priority health needs, while continuing to pursue the goal of an AIDS-free generation. ","701":"Community-based provision of injectable contraception continues to advance and is gaining wider acceptance-a major step toward meeting unmet need. However, fully addressing family planning need will require access to a much wider range of methods, including long-acting reversible contraception and permanent methods. ","702":"Key components to support local institutional and consumer markets are: supply chain, finance, clinical use, and consumer use. Key lessons learned: (1) Build supply and demand simultaneously. (2) Support a lead organization to drive the introduction process. (3) Plan for scale up from the start. (4) Profitability for the private sector is an absolute. ","703":"A better understanding of the factors influencing use of family planning has the potential to increase contraceptive prevalence and improve the ability of women and their partners to freely choose the number and spacing of their children. Investigations into factors contributing to unmet need frequently rely on data collected using household surveys or interviews with family planning clients and providers. This research utilizes qualitative information resulting from simulated client visits to investigate programmatic barriers to contraceptive use in a sample of 19 health care facilities in Kisumu East District, a city in Western Kenya. Simulated client reports indicate deficiencies in provider competence as well as tenuous relations between providers and clients. In addition, simulated client data reveal occasional absences of providers during normal facility hours of operation and requests of informal fees for services. Trainings that address specific gaps in provider medical knowledge and counseling skills as well as client-provider relations may reduce programmatic barriers to contraceptive use. In addition, improved supervision and oversight at facilities may increase physical and financial access to services. Future research investigating provider motivations may illuminate root causes of programmatic barriers.","704":"Computer-Assisted Personal Interviewing (CAPI), coupled with the use of mobile and wireless technology, is growing as a data collection methodology. Nepal, a geographically diverse and resource-scarce country, implemented the 2011 Nepal Demographic and Health Survey, a nationwide survey of major health indicators, using tablet personal computers (tablet PCs) and wireless technology for the first time in the country. This paper synthesizes responses on the benefits and challenges of using new technology in such a challenging environment from the 89 interviewers who administered the survey. Overall, feedback from the interviewers indicate that the use of tablet PCs and wireless technology to administer the survey demonstrated potential to improve data quality and reduce data collection time-benefits that outweigh manageable challenges, such as storage and transport of the tablet PCs during fieldwork, limited options for confidential interview space due to screen readability issues under direct sunlight, and inconsistent electricity supply at times. The introduction of this technology holds great promise for improving data availability and quality, even in a context with limited infrastructure and extremely difficult terrain. ","705":null,"706":"Access to electricity is critical to health care delivery and to the overarching goal of universal health coverage. Data on electricity access in health care facilities are rarely collected and have never been reported systematically in a multi-country study. We conducted a systematic review of available national data on electricity access in health care facilities in sub-Saharan Africa. We identified publicly-available data from nationally representative facility surveys through a systematic review of articles in PubMed, as well as through websites of development agencies, ministries of health, and national statistics bureaus. To be included in our analysis, data sets had to be collected in or after 2000, be nationally representative of a sub-Saharan African country, cover both public and private health facilities, and include a clear definition of electricity access. We identified 13 health facility surveys from 11 sub-Saharan African countries that met our inclusion criteria. On average, 26% of health facilities in the surveyed countries reported no access to electricity. Only 28% of health care facilities, on average, had reliable electricity among the 8 countries reporting data. Among 9 countries, an average of 7% of facilities relied solely on a generator. Electricity access in health care facilities increased by 1.5% annually in Kenya between 2004 and 2010, and by 4% annually in Rwanda between 2001 and 2007. Energy access for health care facilities in sub-Saharan African countries varies considerably. An urgent need exists to improve the geographic coverage, quality, and frequency of data collection on energy access in health care facilities. Standardized tools should be used to collect data on all sources of power and supply reliability. The United Nations Secretary-General's \"Sustainable Energy for All\" initiative provides an opportunity to comprehensively monitor energy access in health care facilities. Such evidence about electricity needs and gaps would optimize use of limited resources, which can help to strengthen health systems. ","707":null,"708":"A USAID-sponsored family planning project called \"FALAH\" (Family Advancement for Life and Health), implemented in 20 districts of Pakistan, aimed to lower unmet need for family planning by improving access to services. To enhance the quality of care offered by the public health system, the FALAH project trained 10,534 facility-based health care providers, managers, and medical college faculty members to offer client-centered family planning services, which included a module to explain the Islamic viewpoint on family planning developed through an iterative process involving religious scholars and public health experts. At the end of the FALAH project, we conducted a situation analysis of health facilities including interviews with providers to measure family planning knowledge of trained and untrained providers; interviewed faculty to obtain their feedback about the training module; and measured changes in women's contraceptive use through baseline and endline surveys. Trained providers had a better understanding of family planning concepts than untrained providers. In addition, discussions with trained providers indicated that the training module on Islam and family planning helped them to become advocates for family planning. Faculty indicated that the module enhanced their confidence about the topic of family planning and Islam, making it easier to introduce and discuss the issue with their students. Over the 3.5-year project period, which included several components in addition to the training activity, we found an overall increase of 9 percentage points in contraceptive prevalence in the project implementation districts-from 29% to 38%. The Islam and family planning module has now been included in the teaching program of major public-sector medical universities and the Regional Training Institutes of the Population Welfare Department. Other countries with sizeable Muslim populations and low contraceptive prevalence could benefit from this module. ","709":null,"710":"To examine how much contraceptive use increases as additional methods are made available to populations. We used data estimating contraceptive use from representative national surveys and data estimating method availability from special surveys to make comparisons for 6 modern contraceptive methods, in each of 6 years: 1982, 1989, 1994, 1999, 2004, and 2009. To estimate method availability, we used various method accessibility rules governing different proportions of the total population (ranging from 20% to 80%) that must have access to a method in order for it to qualify as \"available.\" Contraceptive use is greater when more methods are available to a large portion of the population, both cross-sectionally and over time. The addition of 1 method available to at least half the population correlates with an increase of 4-8 percentage points in total use of the 6 modern methods, for example, from 40% to 44% or 48%. A consistent pattern emerges for the relationship of contraceptive use and choice among multiple methods. Use of contraception may be increased by extending the availability of current methods, by improving features of current methods, or by introducing new methods. A wider choice of methods also improves the ability to meet the individual needs of women and couples. Although the method mix has been improving over time, current availability is far from ideal; in 2009, only about 3.5 methods, on average, were available to at least half of the population in the 113 countries included in our analysis. ","711":"Despite decades of support for international food assistance programs by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) Office of Food for Peace, relatively little is known about the commodity pipeline and management issues these programs face in post-conflict and politically volatile settings. Based on an audit of the program's commodity tracking system and interviews with 13 key program staff, this case study documents the experiences of organizations implementing the first USAID-funded non-emergency (development) food assistance program approved for Sudan and South Sudan. Key challenges and lessons learned in this experience about food commodity procurement, transport, and management may help improve the design and implementation of future development food assistance programs in a variety of complex, food-insecure settings around the world. Specifically, expanding shipping routes in complex political situations may facilitate reliable and timely commodity delivery. In addition, greater flexibility to procure commodities locally, rather than shipping U.S.-procured commodities, may avoid unnecessary shipping delays and reduce costs. ","712":"High levels of unmet need for family planning and high contraceptive discontinuation rates persist in Jordan, prompting the Jordan Health Communication Partnership (JHCP) to initiate a client-centered family planning service program called \"Consult and Choose\" (CC), together with community-based activities to encourage women with unmet need to visit health centers. We held exit interviews with 461 family planning clients between November-December 2011 to assess, from the clients' perspective, whether trained providers followed the CC protocol and used the CC tools, as well as to measure client satisfaction. We also tracked referral card information from community-based activities to health centers and examined service statistics to explore trends in family planning use. On average, clients reported that providers performed 5.6 of the 7 steps outlined in the CC protocol. Nearly 83% of respondents were very satisfied with their clinic visits. Logistic regression analysis found that the odds of being \"very satisfied\" increases by 20% with each additional counseling protocol step performed and by 70% with each increase in the number of CC materials used. Between June 2011 and August 2012, 14,490 referral cards from community-based activities were collected in health centers, 59% of which were for family planning services. Service statistic trends indicate an increase in the number of new family planning users and in couple-years of protection after starting the CC program. Implementation of the CC program at health centers nationally, in tandem with community-based interventions, could play a key role in attaining Jordan's goal of reducing its total fertility rate to 2.1 by 2030. Although this initiative would likely be replicated most readily in other middle-income countries, lower-resource countries could also adapt the tested CC approach.

The initiative was launched in 4 phases. First, it was piloted in 3 villages to develop appropriate strategies. Second, the approach was tested in a factorial trial, which showed that community-based care could reduce childhood mortality by half in only 3 years. Then, a replication experiment was launched to clarify appropriate activities for implementing the fourth and final phase-national scale up. This paper discusses CHPS progress in the Upper East Region (UER) of Ghana, where the pace of scale up has been much more rapid than in the other 9 regions of the country despite exceedingly challenging economic, ecological, and social circumstances. The UER employed 5 strategies that facilitated scale up: (1) nurse recruitment from their home districts to improve worker morale and cultural grounding, balanced with some social distance from the village community to ensure client confidentiality, particularly regarding family planning use; (2) prioritization of CHPS planning and continuous review in management meetings to make necessary modifications to the initiative's approach; (3) community engagement and advocacy to local politicians to mobilize resources for financing start-up costs; (4) a shared and consistent vision about CHPS among health administration leaders to ensure appropriate resources and commitment to the initiative; and (5) knowledge exchange visits between new and advanced CHPS implementers to facilitate learning and scale up within and between districts. ","722":"In 2009, the Government of Tanzania embarked on scaling up voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) services for HIV prevention in 8 priority regions, with the aim of serving 2.8 million boys and men ages 10-34 years by 2013. By mid-2012, more than 110,000 boys and men in Iringa and Njombe regions had received VMMC. The majority (85%) of these VMMC clients were under 19 years old (average age, 16 years). This study aimed to identify potential barriers and facilitators to VMMC among older men. We conducted 16 focus group discussions, stratified by sex and age, with 142 purposefully selected participants in 3 districts of Iringa and Njombe regions. Both men and women generally had positive attitudes toward VMMC. Social and personal barriers to obtaining VMMC among adult men included shame associated with seeking services co-located with younger boys and perceived inappropriateness of VMMC after puberty, particularly after marriage and after having children. Additional barriers included concerns about partner infidelity during the post-surgical abstinence period, loss of income, and fear of pain associated with post-surgical erections. Facilitators included awareness of the HIV-prevention benefit and perceptions of cleanliness and enhanced attractiveness to women. While men and women in Iringa and Njombe regions in Tanzania generally view VMMC as a desirable procedure, program implementers need to address barriers to VMMC services among adult men. Selected service delivery sites in the Iringa and Njombe regions will be segregated by age to provide services that are \"friendly\" to adult men. Services will be complemented with behavior change communication initiatives to address concerns of older men, encourage women's support for circumcision and adherence to the post-surgical abstinence period, and change social norms that inhibit older men from seeking circumcision. ","723":"Demographic and Health Survey data from 18 countries were analyzed to better understand the characteristics of women wishing to limit childbearing. Demand for limiting (14% of all women) is less than that that for spacing (25%) but is still substantial. The mean \"demand crossover age\" (the average age at which demand to limit births begins to exceed demand to space) is generally around age 33, but in some countries it is as low as 23 or 24. Young women often intend to limit their births, contrary to the assumption that only older women do. Large numbers of women have exceeded their desired fertility but do not use family planning, citing fear of side effects and health concerns as barriers. When analysis is restricted to married women, demand for limiting nearly equals that for spacing. Many women who want no more children and who use contraception, especially poor women and those with less education, use less effective temporary contraceptive methods. A sizable number of women in sub-Saharan Africa-nearly 8 million-have demand for limiting future births. Limiting births has a greater impact on fertility rates than spacing births and is a major factor driving the fertility transition. Family planning programs must prepare to meet this demand by addressing supply- and demand-side barriers to use. Meeting the growing needs of sub-Saharan African women who want to limit births is essential, as they are a unique audience that has long been overlooked and underserved. ","724":"Uttar Pradesh (UP) is the most populous state in India with the second highest reported maternal mortality ratio in the country. In an effort to analyze the reasons for maternal deaths and implement appropriate interventions, the Government of India introduced Maternal Death Review guidelines in 2010. We assessed causes of and factors leading to maternal deaths in Unnao District, UP, through 2 methods. First, we conducted a facility gap assessment in 15 of the 16 block-level and district health facilities to collect information on the performance of the facilities in terms of treating obstetric complications. Second, teams of trained physicians conducted community-based maternal death reviews (verbal autopsies) in a sample of maternal deaths occurring between June 1, 2009, and May 31, 2010. Of the 248 maternal deaths that would be expected in this district in a year, we identified 153 (62%) through community workers and conducted verbal autopsies with families of 57 of them. Verbal autopsies indicated that 23% and 30% of these maternal deaths occurred at home and on the way to a health facility, respectively. Most of the women who died had been taken to at least 2 health facilities. The facility assessment revealed that only the district hospital met the recommended criteria for either basic or comprehensive emergency obstetric and neonatal care. Life-saving treatment of obstetric complications was not offered at the appropriate level of government facilities in a representative district in UP, and an inadequate referral system provided fatal delays. Expensive transportation costs to get pregnant women to a functioning medical facility also contributed to maternal death. The maternal death review, coupled with the facility gap assessment, is a useful tool to address the adequacy of emergency obstetric and neonatal care services to prevent further maternal deaths. ","725":"In Uttar Pradesh, India, in response to low routine immunization coverage and ongoing poliovirus circulation, a network of U.S.-based CORE Group member and local nongovernmental organizations partnered with UNICEF, creating the Social Mobilization Network (SMNet). The SMNet's goal was to improve access and reduce family and community resistance to vaccination. The partners trained thousands of mobilizers from high-risk communities to visit households, promote government-run child immunization services, track children's immunization history and encourage vaccination of children missing scheduled vaccinations, and mobilize local opinion leaders. Creative behavior change activities and materials promoted vaccination awareness and safety, household hygiene, sanitation, home diarrheal-disease control, and breastfeeding. Program decision-makers at all levels used household-level data that were aggregated at community and district levels, and senior staff provided rapid feedback and regular capacity-building supervision to field staff. Use of routine project data and targeted research findings offered insights into and informed innovative approaches to overcoming community concerns impacting immunization coverage. While the SMNet worked in the highest-risk, poorly served communities, data suggest that the immunization coverage in SMNet communities was often higher than overall coverage in the district.
