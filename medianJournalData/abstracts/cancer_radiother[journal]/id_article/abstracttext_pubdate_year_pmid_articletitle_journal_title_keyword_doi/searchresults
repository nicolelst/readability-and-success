prostatectomy (RP) has been found to be curative in most cases of prostate cancer (PCa); however, 20-40% of patients have a biochemical recurrence (BCR) of the disease. Prostatic specific antigen prostate-specific antigen (PSA) levels are used to assess patient prognosis after surgery; however, there is no consensus about the optimal PSA level that defines BCR. Detection of very low volume disease and early detection of the disease are very important predictors for clinical outcomes in BCR, as early salvage radiation therapy (SRT) provides a possibility of a cure. The aim of this study is to review briefly about important and controversies in radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy. No guideline exists to select ideal patients for each treatment, but there are tools currently being developed; genetic tests and prostate-specific membrane antigen (PSMA) positron emission tomography (PET) may be able to identify patients with worse outcomes who would benefit from more treatment.","1":"Roughly 20% of patients with non-small-cell lung cancer exhibit locally advanced, unresectable, stage III disease. Concurrent platinum-based chemoradiotherapy is the backbone treatment, which is followed by maintenance immunotherapy, yet with poor long-term prognosis. This phase II trial (IFCT-0803) sought to evaluate whether adding cetuximab to cisplatin and pemetrexed chemoradiotherapy would improve its efficacy in these patients. Eligible patients received weekly cetuximab (loading dose 400mg\/m2 day 1; subsequent weekly 250mg\/m2 doses until two weeks postradiotherapy). Chemotherapy comprised cisplatin (75mg\/m2) and pemetrexed (500mg\/m2), both delivered on day 1 of a 21-day cycle of maximally four. Irradiation with maximally 66Gy started on day 22. Disease control rate at week 16 was the primary endpoint. One hundred and six patients were included (99 eligible patients). Compliance exceeded 95% for day 1 of chemotherapy cycles 1 to 4, with 76% patients receiving the 12 planned cetuximab doses. Maximal grade 3 toxicity occurred in 63% patients, and maximal grade 4 in 9.6%. The primary endpoint involving the first 95 eligible patients comprised two (2.1%) complete responses, 57 (60.0%) partial responses, and 27 (28.4%) stable diseases. This 90.5% disease control rate (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 84.6%-96.4%) was achieved at week 16. After median 63.0-month follow-up, one-year and two-year survival rates were 75.8% and 59.5%. Median overall survival was 35.8months (95% CI: 23.5-NR), and median progression-free survival 14.4months (95% CI: 11.2-18.8), with one-year and two-year progression-free survival rates of 57.6% and 34.3%. These survival rates compare favourably with published data, thus justifying further development of cetuximab-based induction chemoradiotherapy. ","2":"Endocrine complications after radiotherapy are usually delayed and require prolonged follow-up by the radiation oncologist. Endocrine glands are dispersed throughout the body and can be included in the radiation field of several tumors. As the symptomatology can sometimes be insidious and non-specific, their screening is based on a directed clinical examination but also on systematic hormonal assays. The thyroid gland is particularly radiosensitive, and hypothyroidism is generally observed for doses of more than 30Gy. After cervical irradiation, it is recommended to perform a TSH assay every 6 to 12months. The risk of secondary thyroid cancer only concerns children and exists even at low doses, systematic screening is required. The risk of pituitary insufficiency is dose-dependent, with different sensitivity for each axis. In children, the main concern is the early detection of somatotropic insufficiency in order to prevent the risk of short stature. Reproductive function can be impaired after receiving 4-6Gy requiring fertility preservation. Endocrine side effects can be treated to improve quality of life; therefore, we propose several approaches to be followed in order to promote screening and treatment.","3":"To evaluate the impact of postoperative radiotherapy (PORT) on survival in olfactory neuroblastoma (ONB) patients with different tumor staging. Patients with ONB were selected in the Surveillance, Epidemiology and End Results (SEER) database from 2004-2016. Survival analyses were performed using Kaplan-Meier (K-M) method, Cox regression analysis, and competing risk model. A total of 513 patients were included in the study. Univariate and multivariate analysis results demonstrated that PORT was not an independent prognostic factor for overall survival (OS) of modified Kadish stage A and B patients (P=0.699 and P=0.248, respectively). Kadish stage C and D patients who underwent PORT had significantly better OS than those who did not undergo PORT (P=0.03 and P&lt;0.0001). K-M curves revealed that the 5- and 10-year OS rates of patients who underwent PORT vs. non-PORT were 85.3% vs. 70.4% and 68.2% vs. 56.8% in stage C patients, respectively. For stage D patients, the 5-year OS rates were 70.7% and 42.6%, and 10-year OS rates were 53.4% and 29.5% in the PORT and non-PORT groups, respectively. The competitive risk model revealed that the 5-year cancer-specific cumulative mortality incidence decreased by 26.6% while the 10-year mortality incidence decreased by 41.4% in Kadish stage C patients who were treated using PORT; meanwhile, for Kadish stage D patients who were treated with PORT, the 5- and 10-year mortality incidences were reduced by 35.3% and 42.6%, respectively. Furthermore, we found that chemotherapy was not related to the prognosis of ONB patients (all P&gt;0.05). Our results indicate that PORT improved survival outcomes of modified Kadish stage C and D ONB patients. However, PORT may not affect survival for modified Kadish stage A and B individuals. Chemotherapy was not recommended for ONB; therefore, further studies are warranted to determine its therapeutic significance. ","4":"Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery are major therapeutic weapons in the brain, whether for tumor, vascular or functional treatments. They tend increasingly to democratize and to become standard treatments. However, human brain anatomy is very complex and not limited to the currently described organs at risk. Diffusion tensor imaging (DTI) tractography is a simple tool that enables to identify reproducibly big white matter fiber tracts. Not only does tractography allow a redefinition of organs at risk in the brain, but it would also allow the identification of new targets, such as the ventral intermediate nucleus (Vim) within the thalamus for treatment of movement disorders. We present here a review of the role of tractography and the anatomy, function and currently described dose-effect relationships of white matter fiber tracts with a major functional impact: the pyramidal tract for motor ability, the optic radiation for vision and the arcuate fasciculus for language.","5":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma diagnosis is often made at a locally advanced stage (75 to 90% of cases) due to its deep localization. Concomitant radio-chemotherapy is the cornerstone of the treatment of locally advanced forms. The advent of intensity-modulated radiotherapy has improved oncological outcomes and reduced toxicity and is currently the gold standard for irradiation technique. For the locally advanced stage, the addition of induction chemotherapy has become the new standard care according to the latest international recommendations to reduce tumor volumes and act early on micro-metastases. Despite these therapeutic advances, the local and especially distant failure rate remains high. This article reviews current treatment strategies and discuss new approaches and perspectives of locoregional and systemic treatment to reduce treatment failures.","6":"Re-irradiation of pelvic recurrent gynecological cancer is a challenge due to the proximity of high-radiation-sensitive organs, such as the bowel and the urinary tract. Hadrontherapy for re-irradiation emerges as a safe and effective treatment with a mild rate of morbidity of surrounding normal tissue. To improve the dose to the tumor, a prophylactic displacement of organs at risk is needed, and a multidisciplinary approach is recommended. In this technical note, we report a surgical technique of omentum spacer placement for patients enrolled for carbon ion radiotherapy as re-irradiation for recurrent gynecological tumors.","7":"Management of inter- and intra-fraction movements of target volumes and organs at risk (OARs) during radiotherapy is essential. While there is little OAR or target volume movement, the movements and orientation of the eyes can be significant during radiotherapy and they can affect the position of the optic nerve. The objective of the present study was to assess the variations of the optic nerve position due to gaze direction and to discuss their clinical consequences on the radiation treatment of intraorbital tumors. Three patients without a history of oculomotor nerve palsy underwent six CT acquisitions with a thermoplastic mask: eyes open with different gaze directions (straight ahead, left, right, up, down) and eyes closed. The acquisition with the straight-ahead gaze was chosen as the reference position. Left and right optic nerves were segmented on the six acquisitions, and total volumes and maximum amplitude motions were calculated in three dimensions. Maximum differences were observed while looking left and up, with a median maximum amplitude of 5 and 6mm [range: 2-7mm], respectively. These motions induced a position variation of more than 50% of the volume of the optic nerve (compared to the reference position). Greater variations of motion were observed for the anterior portion of the nerve. The gaze position with the fewest variations compared to the reference position was eyes closed. Optic nerve positions vary significantly due to the gaze direction, especially for the anterior portion of the nerve. These variations should be taken into account for the treatment of small intraorbital tumors involving the anterior third of the optic nerve.

Our aim was to evaluate the local control, overall survival, progression free survival and adverse events in breast cancer patients treated with this new technique. This is retrospective analysis of patients irradiated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy with helical Tomotherapy. Overall survival and progression free survival curves were plotted with Kaplan-Meier method. We also analysed the overall survival and progression-free survival data by molecular subgroups. Long-term toxicity including skin, cardiac and pulmonary complications were also evaluated. Multivariant logistic regression analysis was performed to determine the predictors of the side effects. Between 2009-2015, 179 consecutive patients with 194 treated breasts were irradiated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy with helical Tomotherapy. The median follow-up were 65 months. The overall survival rate was 89.2% (95% confidence interval [95CI]: 83.5-95.4%), while disease-free survival rate was 85.4% (95CI: 80.2-91%). The Human epidermal growth factor receptor 2-positive patients had the best 5-year overall survival data of 95% (95CI: 85.9-100%). Long-term skin toxicity was the most common, seen in a total of 20.7% of the patients. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy with helical Tomotherapy could be safely used for adjuvant breast cancer irradiation in patients with complex anatomy and provides favourable long-term prognosis with acceptable late toxicity. ","10":"To explore the potential protective effect of Kanglaite injection against radiotherapy-induced mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer. This was an open-label, single-arm, and phase II trial. The primary endpoint was the incidence of grade 3-4 radiation-induced mucositis. The secondary endpoints were hematological toxicity, non-hematological toxicity, nutritional status, and quality of life. All patients received 20g Kanglaite daily concurrently with radiotherapy. The data of 46 patients were available for analysis. The incidence rates of grade 3 mucositis, pain, dysphagia, and neutropenia were 10.9%, 2.2%, 10.9%, and 6.5%, respectively, while the incidence of grade 4 acute toxicities was zero. The rate of opioid use was 2.2%. Radiotherapy dose reduction was 2.2% and no irradiation field was modified. The nutritional supports were oro-enteral nutritional supplements (13.0%), TPN (10.9%), and feeding tubes (0%) during radiotherapy. After radiotherapy, 52.2% of patients lost weight, and the weight loss was &lt;10%. The mean pain score in the QLQ-H&amp;N35 and QLQ-C30 was &lt;50. Patients had nearly normal physical, emotional, and cognitive functions. A low incidence of grade 3-4 radiation-induced mucositis and no severe acute toxic events, with favorable nutritional status and quality of life, were observed in cancer patients after Kanglaite injection. Our findings highlight the need for a prospective, multicenter, and randomized study to investigate the effect of Kanglaite injection on the reduction of radiation-induced mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer. ","11":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic continues to spread exponentially around the world. Cancer patients have a higher risk of commorbidity than the rest of the population. Radiotherapy departments are actively involved in the management of these patients, whether they have COVID or not, and it is recognized that the time taken to take charge and the continuity of treatment have a prognostic impact. The main objective was to assess the impact of the coronavirus on the treatment times of patients undergoing radiotherapy. This retrospective study was conducted in the radiotherapy department of Gustave-Roussy institute (France) during the period from March 3, 2020 to January 12, 2021. Organizational changes, patient care times between the day of the scan and the last radiotherapy session as well as the time taken to take charge of patients between the first session and the last radiotherapy session has been studied. A total of 1183 patients were included, among which 60 had COVID-19. Patients were divided into four categories. Treatment times of patients who did not have COVID-19 and those of patients who did were not statistically significantly different. The organization of the radiotherapy department at the Gustave-Roussy institute is based on several points: carrying out preventive screening tests, protecting staff and patients and reorganizing the patient circuit. Thanks to the performance of diagnostic tests and the implementation of a specific workflow for patients with COVID, we ensure the continuity of patient treatment in complete safety without impacting treatment times. ","12":null,"13":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (covid-19) caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (Sars-Cov-2) is at the origin of a global pandemic. This pandemic has prompted the current health system to reorganize and rethink the care offered by health establishments. We report the early and late toxicity in patients infected with covid-19 treated at the same time for early-stage breast cancer. This is a monocentric prospective study of patients treated in our hospital between March and June 2020 who were diagnosed with covid-19 infection. The inclusion criteria were to be irradiated for early-stage breast cancer and to have a positive covid diagnosis on a polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test and\/or a lung computed tomography (CT) scan and\/or suggestive clinical symptoms. All of them needed 6 months follow-up clinic after the end of the radiotherapy with clinical examination, mammogram, as well as CT scan to evaluate the lung status. Radiotherapy consisted of breast or chest wall irradiation with or without lymph node irradiation, with protocols adapted to pandemic situation. The treatment-related toxicity was graded according to the Common Toxicology Criteria for Adverse Events (version 4.03). All 350 patients treated for early-stage breast cancer were studied. Of them, 16 presented clinical symptoms of covid-19 infection, and of them 12 had clinical, CT scan and PCR confirmation. This entire cohort of 12 patients with median age of 56years (range: 42-72 years) underwent their radiotherapy. During the radiotherapy, nine patients presented radiodermatitis: eight grade 1 (66%) and one grade 2 (8%). Two patients with lymph nodes irradiation presented grade 2 oesophagitis. Late toxicity was evaluated 6 months after the end of the radiotherapy, and there was no radiation or covid lung sequel on the CT scans. One patient presented covid-related dyspnoea, and two had fibrosis. The half-year follow-up of prospective covid-19 cohort, treated for early-stage breast cancer demonstrated an acceptable toxicity profile with few low-grade adverse events. It seems that the covid-19 infection does not appear to increase the side effects of radiotherapy. Therefore radiotherapy should not be delayed. ","14":"Radiation-induced heart disease is a complication that occurs years after thoracic irradiation. Recent studies suggest that radiation-induced heart disease could be an earlier complication and that subclinical cardiac injury can be detected. The present case described an increased uptake of (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose incidentally detected on positron emission tomography after left breast irradiation with slightly reversible perfusion defect on (99mTc)-tetrofosmin single photon emission computed tomography. The cardiac clinical examination was asymptomatic, and the patient had a normal angiography, suggesting a radiation-induced hibernating myocardium. The relevant question is: how far should an incidentally (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake be explored?","15":"Radiotherapy remains an important treatment modality for patients with chest malignancies; this is particularly true in patients with breast cancer and Hodgkin lymphoma as well as lung, esophageal, and other mediastinal tumors. More than half of patients with these conditions receive radiotherapy at some point. With the development of new treatment modalities, we are witnessing an improvement of overall survival requiring carefully watching of acute and chronic toxicity of radiation therapy. The challenge is not to ignore radiotherapy's side effects in order to explore and prevent them in the future. Strategies for optimizing thoracic radiotherapy and the advent of innovative techniques may represent an encouraging way to decrease thoracic toxicities. We reviewed the literature to identify these cases of toxicity, which are sometimes forgotten, and others, which have recently been described but remain poorly known.","16":"","17":"A third of children with cancer receive radiotherapy as part of their initial treatment, which represents 800 paediatric irradiations per year in France carried out in 15 specialized centres approved on the recommendations of the French national cancer institute in decreasing order of frequency, the types of cancer that require irradiation are: brain tumours, neuroblastomas, Ewing's sarcomas, Hodgkin's lymphomas, soft tissue sarcomas including rhabdomyosarcomas, and nephroblastomas. The treatment guidelines follow the recommendations of the French society for childhood cancers (SFCE) or the French and European prospective protocols. The therapeutic indications, the technical and\/and ballistic choices of complex cases are frequently discussed during bimonthly paediatric radiotherapy technical web-conferences. All cancers combined, overall survival being 80%, long-term toxicity logically becomes an important concern, making the preparation of treatments complex. The irradiation methods include all the techniques currently available: 3D conformational irradiation, intensity modulation radiation therapy, irradiation under normal or hypofractionated stereotaxic conditions, brachytherapy and proton therapy. We present the update of the recommendations of the French society for radiation oncology on the indications, the technical methods of realization and the organisation and the specificities of paediatric radiation oncology.","18":null,"19":"We present the update of the recommendations of the French society of radiation oncology on soft tissue sarcomas. Currently, the initial management of sarcomas is very important as it may impact on patients' quality of life, especially in limb soft tissue sarcomas, and on overall survival in trunk sarcomas. Radiotherapy has to be discussed within a multidisciplinary board meeting with results of biopsy, eventually reexamined by a dedicated sarcoma pathologist. The role of radiotherapy varies according to localization of soft tissue sarcoma. It is part of the standard treatment in grade 2 and 3 sarcomas of the extremities and superficial trunk&gt;5cm. In case of R1 or R2 resection, reexcision should be discussed. In such cases, it may be delivered preoperatively (50Gy\/25 fractions of 2Gy) or postoperatively. In retroperitoneal sarcomas, preoperative conformal radiotherapy with or without modulated intensity cannot be proposed systematically in daily practice. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy cannot be considered a standard treatment. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy has become widely available. Other soft tissue sarcoma sites such as trunk, head and neck and gynaecological soft tissue sarcomas will be addressed, as well as other techniques that may be used such as brachytherapy and proton therapy.","20":"The first intent upfront treatment of endometrial cancer is surgery. External radiotherapy and brachytherapy; however, are important tools in adjuvant setting, according to histopathological risk factors for locoregional recurrence or in the event of an inoperable tumor. We present the update of the recommendations of the French society of oncological radiotherapy on the indications and technical methods of performing radiotherapy and brachytherapy for endometrial cancer.","21":"Prostate brachytherapy techniques are described, concerning both permanent seed implant and high dose rate brachytherapy. The following guidelines are presented: brachytherapy indications, implant procedure for permanent low dose rate implants and high dose rate with source projector, as well as dose and dose-constraints objectives, immediate postoperative management, post-treatment evaluation, and long-term follow-up.","22":"We present the update of the recommendations of the French society of oncological radiotherapy on radiotherapy of cutaneous cancers. The indications of radiotherapy for skin cancers are not clearly defined because of the lack of randomized trials or prospective studies. For basal cell carcinomas, radiotherapy frequently offers a good local control, but a randomized trial showed that surgery is more efficient and less toxic. Indications of radiotherapy are contra-indications of surgery for patients older than 60, non-sclerodermiform histology and located in non-sensitive areas. Adjuvant radiotherapy could be proposed to squamous cell carcinomas, in case of poor prognostic factors. Dose of 60 to 70Gy are usually required, and must be modulated to the size of the lesions. Adjuvant radiotherapy seems beneficial for desmoplastic melanomas but not for the other histological types. Prophylactic nodal irradiation (45 to 50Gy), for locally advanced tumors (massive nodal involvement), decreases the locoregional failure rate but do not increase survival. Adjuvant radio- therapy (50 to 56Gy) for Merkel cell carcinomas increases also the local control rate, as demonstrated by meta-analysis and a large epidemiological study. Nodal areas must be included, if there is no surgical exploration (sentinel lymph node dissection). Kaposi sarcomas are radiosensitive and could be treated with relatively low doses (24 to 30Gy). Also, cutaneous lymphomas are good indications for radiotherapy: B lymphomas are electively treated with limited fields. The role of total skin electron therapy for T-lymphomas is still discussed; but palliative radiotherapy is very efficient in case of cutaneous nodules.","23":"We present the update of the recommendations of the French society of oncological radiotherapy on bone metastases. This is a common treatment in the management of patients with cancer. It is a relatively simple treatment with proven efficacy in reducing pain or managing spinal cord compression. More complex treatments by stereotaxis can be proposed for oligometastatic patients or in case of reirradiation. In this context, increased vigilance should be given to the risks to the spinal cord.","24":"We present the update of the recommendations of the French society of oncological radiotherapy on external radiotherapy of prostate cancer. External radiotherapy is intended for all localized prostate cancers, and more recently for oligometastatic prostate cancers. The irradiation techniques are detailed. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy combined with prostate image-guided radiotherapy is the recommended technique. A total dose of 74 to 80Gy is recommended in case of standard fractionation (2Gy per fraction). Moderate hypofractionation (total dose of 60Gy at a rate of 3Gy per fraction over 4 weeks) in the prostate has become a standard of therapy. Simultaneous integrated boost techniques can be used to treat lymph node areas. Extreme hypofractionation (35 to 40Gy in five fractions) using stereotactic body radiotherapy can be considered a therapeutic option to treat exclusively the prostate. The postoperative irradiation technique, indicated mainly in case of biological recurrence and lymph node involvement, is detailed.","25":"External beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy are major treatments in the management of cervical cancer. For early-stage tumours with local risk factors, brachytherapy is a preoperative option. Postoperative radiotherapy is indicated according to histopathological criteria. For advanced local tumours, chemoradiation is the standard treatment, followed by brachytherapy boost, which is not optional. We present the update of the recommendations of the French Society of Oncological Radiotherapy on the indications and techniques for external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy for cervical cancer.","26":"We present the updated recommendations of the French society for radiation oncology on radiotherapy of oesophageal cancer. Oesophageal cancer still remains a malignant tumour with a poor prognosis. Surgery remains the standard treatment for localized cancers, regardless of histology. For locally advanced stages, surgery remains a standard for adenocarcinomas after neoadjuvant treatment with chemotherapy or chemoradiotherapy. However, it is a therapeutic option after initial chemoradiotherapy for stage III squamous cell carcinomas, given the increased morbidity and mortality with a multimodal treatment, which results in an equivalent overall survival with or without surgery. Preoperative or exclusive chemoradiotherapy should be delivered according to validated regimens with an effective total dose (50Gy), if surgery is not planned or if the tumour is deemed resectable before chemoradiotherapy. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy significantly reduces irradiation of the lungs and heart and may reduce the morbidity of this treatment, especially in combination with surgery. In case of exclusive chemoradiotherapy, dose escalation beyond 50Gy is not currently recommended. Some technical considerations still remain questionable, such as the place of prophylactic lymph node irradiation, adaptive radiotherapy, evaluation of response during and after chemoradiotherapy and the value of proton therapy.","27":"We present the update of the recommendations of the French society for radiation oncology on external radiotherapy and brachytherapy of anal canal carcinoma. The following guidelines are presented: indications, treatment procedure, as well as dose and dose-constraints objectives, immediate postoperative management, post-treatment evaluation, and long-term follow-up.","28":"Primary vaginal cancers are rare tumours, for which external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy are major treatment tools. Given the complexity of brachytherapy techniques, the treatment should be performed in specialised centres. We present the recommendations of the French society for radiation oncology on the indications and techniques for external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy for primary vaginal cancer.","29":"Adjuvant radiotherapy is an essential component of the treatment of breast cancer. After conservative surgery for an infiltrating carcinoma, radiotherapy must be systematically performed, regardless of the characteristics of the disease, because it decreases the rate of local recurrence and by this way, specific mortality. A boost dose over the tumour bed is required if the patient is younger than 50 years-old. Partial breast irradiation could be routinely proposed as an alternative to whole breast irradiation, but only in selected and informed patients. For ductal carcinoma in situ, adjuvant radiotherapy must be also systematically performed after lumpectomy. After mastectomy, chest wall irradiation is required for pT3-T4 tumours and if there is an axillary nodal involvement, whatever the number of involved lymph nodes. After neoadjuvant chemotherapy and mastectomy, in case of pN0 disease, chest wall irradiation is recommended if there is a clinically or radiologically T3-T4 or node positive disease before chemotherapy. Axillary irradiation is recommended only if there is no axillary surgical dissection and a positive sentinel lymph node. Supra- and infraclavicular irradiation is advised in case of positive axillary nodes. Internal mammary irradiation must be discussed case by case, according to the benefit\/risk ratio (cardiac toxicity). Hypofractionation regimens (42.5Gy in 16 fractions, or 41,6Gy en 13 or 40Gy en 15) are equivalent to conventional irradiation and must prescribe after tumorectomy in selected patients. Delineation of the breast, the chest wall and the nodal areas are based on clinical and radiological evaluations. 3D-conformal irradiation is the recommended technique, intensity-modulated radiotherapy must be proposed only in specific clinical situations. Respiratory gating could be useful to decrease the cardiac dose. Concomitant administration of chemotherapy in unadvised, but hormonal treatment could be start with or after radiotherapy.","30":"We present the update of the recommendations of the French society for radiation oncology on radiation therapy for the management of brain metastases. It has evolved in recent years and has become more complex. As the life expectancy of patients has increased and retreatments have become more frequent, side effects must be absolutely avoided. Cognitive side effects must in particular be prevented, and the most modern radiation therapy techniques must be used systematically. New prognostic classifications specific to the primary tumour of patients, advances in imaging and radiation therapy technology and new systemic therapeutic strategies, are making treatment more relevant. Stereotactic radiation therapy has supplanted whole-brain radiation therapy both for patients with metastases in place and for those who underwent surgery. Hippocampus protection is possible with intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Its relevance in terms of cognitive functioning should be more clearly demonstrated but the requirement for its use is constantly increasing. New targeted cancer treatment therapies based on the nature of the primitive have complicated the notion of the place and timing of radiation therapy and the discussion during multidisciplinary care meeting to indicate the best sequences is becoming a challenging issue as data on the interaction between treatments remain to be documented. In the end, although aimed at patients in the palliative phase, the management of brain metastases is one of the locations for which technical reflection is the most challenging and treatment become increasingly personalized.","31":"The number of patients with metallic implant and treated with radiotherapy is constantly increasing. These hardware are responsible for the deterioration in the quality of the CT images used at each stage of the radiation therapy, during delineation, dosimetry and dose delivery. We present the update of the recommendations of the French society of oncological radiotherapy on the pros and cons of the different methods, existing and under evaluation, which limit the impact of metallic implants on the quality and safety of radiation treatments.","32":"We present the recommendations of the French society of oncological radiotherapy on the indications and techniques for external beam radiotherapy for bladder cancer.","33":"The purpose of this article is to describe the external irradiation process and updated recommendations of the French society for radiation oncology for patient follow-up.","34":"Radiotherapy for Hodgkin lymphomas has evolved a lot over time, but still plays an important role, almost always in addition to chemotherapy, for the management of the early stages. The major objective is to preserve the quality of life of patients who will be cured from this disease in the vast majority of cases. Also, the personalization of the indications for the purpose of de-escalating toxicity is very refined and is essentially based on the pre- and pertherapeutic assessment by FDG-PET. The indications for radiotherapy are more limited for non-Hodgkin lymphomas, but the same principles are found, regardless of the histological type. We present the update of the recommendations of the French society of oncological radiotherapy for radiotherapy of lymphomas, which remains a very evolving field in terms of therapeutic strategy and evaluation.","35":"Penile cancers are uncommon and should be treated in expert center. Radiotherapy indications are mainly limited to exclusive brachytherapy for early stage penile glans cancer. Brachytherapy yields to excellent outcome for disease control and organ and function preservation. Only scarce data are available for external beam radiation therapy. It could be considered as palliative setting for irradiation of the primary tumor. For lymph node irradiation, external beam radiation therapy (with or without chemotherapy) could be discussed either as neoadjuvant approach prior to surgery for massive inguinal lymph node invasion or as adjuvant approach in case of high-risk of relapse. However, these cases should be discussed on an individual basis, as the level of evidence is poor. We present the recommendations of the French Society of Oncological Radiotherapy on the indications and techniques for external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy for penile glans cancer.","36":"We present an update of the French society of oncological radiotherapy recommendation regarding indication, doses, and technique of radiotherapy for intrathoracic metastases. The recommendations for delineation of the target volumes and critical organs are detailed.","37":"Dose constraints are essential for performing dosimetry, especially for intensity modulation and for radiotherapy under stereotaxic conditions. We present the update of the recommendations of the French society of oncological radiotherapy for the use of these doses in classical current practice but also for reirradiation.","38":"The aim of this review is to present the specificities of clinical research in radiation oncology. Objectives are similar to all research in oncology: to improve the efficacy and to decrease toxic effects. Phase III trials remain the main methodology to demonstrate an improvement in efficiency, but phase I-II and registers are also important tools to validate an improvement in the therapeutic index with new technologies. In this article we discuss the special features of end-points, selection of population, and design for radiation oncology clinical trials. Quality control of delivered treatments is an important component of these protocols. Financial issues are also discussed, in the particular context of France.","39":"Intensity modulated radiation therapy and brachytherapy are standard techniques of irradiation for the treatment of oral cavity cancers. These techniques are detailed in terms of indication, planning, delineation and selection of the volumes of interest, dosimetry and patients positioning control. This is an update of the guidelines of the French Society of Radiotherapy Correspondence.","40":"Primary vulvar carcinomas are rare gynaecological cancers, for which surgery is the mainstay of treatment. There is however a major place for external beam radiotherapy in the situation of inoperable locally advanced tumours and\/or as adjuvant therapy, when there are risk factors for locoregional relapse. We present the recommendations of the French society for radiation oncology on the indications and techniques for radiotherapy in the treatment of primary vulvar cancer.","41":null,"42":"We present the updated recommendations of the French society of oncological radiotherapy for rectal cancer radiotherapy. The standard treatment for locally advanced rectal cancer consists in chemoradiotherapy followed by radical surgery with total mesorectal resection and adjuvant chemotherapy according to nodal status. Although this strategy efficiently reduced local recurrences rates below 5% in expert centres, functional sequelae could not be avoided resulting in 20 to 30% morbidity rates. The early introduction of neoadjuvant chemotherapy has proven beneficial in recent trials, in terms of recurrence free and metastasis free survivals. Complete pathological responses were obtained in 15% of tumours treated by chemoradiation, even reaching up to 30% of tumours when neoadjuvant chemotherapy is associated to chemoradiotherapy. These good results question the relevance of systematic radical surgery in good responders. Personalized therapeutic strategies are now possible by improved imaging modalities with circumferential margin assessed by magnetic resonance imaging, by intensity modulated radiotherapy and by refining surgical techniques, and contribute to morbidity reduction. Keeping the same objectives, ongoing trials are now evaluating therapeutic de-escalation strategies, in particular rectal preservation for good responders after neoadjuvant treatment, or radiotherapy omission in selected cases (Greccar 12, Opera, Norad).","43":"We present the update of the recommendations of the French society of oncological radiotherapy on hepatic tumours. Recent technological progress led to develop the concept of focused liver radiation therapy. We must distinguish primary and secondary tumours, as the indications are restricted and must be discussed as an alternative to surgical or medical treatments. The tumour volume, its liver location close to the organs at risk determine the irradiation technique (repositioning method, total dose delivered, dose fractionation regimens). Tumour (and liver) breathing related motions should be taken into account. Strict dosimetric criteria must be observed with particular attention to the dose-volume histograms of non-tumoral liver as well as of the hollow organs, particularly in case of hypofractionated high dose radiotherapy \"under stereotaxic conditions\". Stereotactic body radiotherapy is being evaluated and is often preferred to radiofrequency for primary or secondary tumours (usually less than 5cm). An adaptation can be proposed, with a conformal fractionated irradiation protocol with or without intensity modulation, for hepatocellular carcinomas larger than 5cm.","44":"We present the update of the recommendations of the French society of oncological radiotherapy on radiotherapy of pancreatic tumors. Currently, the use of radiation therapy for patients with pancreatic cancer is subject to discussion. In the adjuvant setting, the standard treatment is six months of chemotherapy with 5-fluorouracile, irinotecan and oxaliplatin. Chemoradiation may improve the survival of patients with incompletely resected tumours (R1). This remains to be confirmed by a prospective trial. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation is a promising treatment especially for patients with borderline resectable tumours. For patients with locally advanced tumours, there is no standard. An induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiation for non progressive patients reduces the rate of local relapse. Whereas in the first trials of chemoradiation large fields were used, the treated volumes have been reduced to improve tolerance. Tumour movements induced by breathing should be taken in account. Intensity modulated radiation therapy allows a reduction of doses to the organs at risk. Whereas widely used, this technique has poor evidence-based recommendation. Stereotactic body radiation therapy is also being studied, as a neoadjuvant or exclusive treatment.","45":"We present the update of the recommendations of the French society of oncological radiotherapy on radiotherapy of laryngeal cancers. Intensity modulated radiotherapy is the standard of care radiotherapy for the management of laryngeal cancers. Early stage T1 or T2 tumours can be treated either by radiotherapy or conservative surgery. For tumours requiring total laryngectomy (T2 or T3), an organ preservation strategy by either induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy or chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin is recommended. For T4 tumours, a total laryngectomy followed by radiotherapy is recommended when feasible. Dose regimens for definitive and postoperative radiotherapy are detailed in this article, as well as the selection and delineation of tumour and lymph node target volumes.","46":"The place of personalized treatments is highly increasing in medical and radiation oncology. During the last decades, a huge number of assays have been developed to predict responses of normal tissues and tumours. These tests have not yet been included into daily clinical practice but the recent developments of radiation oncology are paving the way of personalized strategies including the risk of tumour recurrence and normal tissue reactions. Concerning tumor radiosensitivity prediction, no test are currently used, even if the radiosensitivity index and the genome-based model for adjusting radiotherapy dose assays seem the most promising with level II of evidence. Commercial developments are under progress. Concerning normal tissue radiosensitivity prediction, single nucleotide polymorphims of prostate cancer patients and radiation-induced CD8 T-lymphocyte apoptosis breast and prostate assays are of level I of evidence. They can be proposed before the beginning of radiotherapy in order to propose personalized treatments according to both risks of tumour and normal tissue radiosensitivity. Commercial developments are also under way.","47":"We present the update of the recommendations of the French society of oncological radiotherapy on radiotherapy for hypopharynx. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy is the gold standard treatment for hypopharynx cancers. Early T1 and T2 tumors could be treated by exclusive radiotherapy or surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy in case of high recurrence risk. For locally advanced tumours requiring total pharyngolaryngectomy (T2 or T3) or with significant lymph nodes involvement, induction chemotherapy followed by exclusive radiotherapy or concurrent chemoradiotherapy were possible. For T4 tumour, surgery must be proposed. The treatment of lymph nodes is based on initial primary tumour treatment. In non-surgical procedure, for 35 fractions, curative dose is 70Gy (2Gy per fraction) and prophylactic dose are 50 to 56Gy (2Gy per fraction in case of sequential radiotherapy or 1.6Gy in case of integrated simultaneous boost) radiotherapy; for 33 fractions, curative dose is 69.96Gy (2.12Gy per fraction) and prophylactic dose is 52.8Gy (1.6Gy per fraction in integrated simultaneous boost radiotherapy or 54Gy in 1.64Gy per fraction); for 30 fractions, curative dose is 66Gy (2.2Gy per fraction) and prophylactic dose is 54Gy (1.8Gy per fraction in integrated simultaneous boost radiotherapy). Doses over 2Gy per fraction could be done when chemotherapy is not used regarding potential larynx toxicity. Postoperatively, radiotherapy is used in locally advanced cancer with dose levels based on pathologic criteria, 60 to 66Gy for R1 resection and 54 to 60Gy for complete resection in bed tumour; 50 to 66Gy in lymph nodes areas regarding extracapsular spread. Volume delineation were based on guidelines cited in this article.","48":"Primary tumours of the salivary glands account for about 5 to 10% of tumours of the head and neck. These tumours represent a multitude of situations and histologies, where surgery is the mainstay of treatment and radiotherapy is frequently needed for malignant tumours (in case of stage T3-T4, nodal involvement, extraparotid invasion, positive or close resection margins, histological high-grade tumour, lymphovascular or perineural invasion, bone involvement postoperatively, or unresectable tumours). The diagnosis relies on anatomic and functional MRI and ultrasound-guided fine-needle aspiration for the diagnostic of benign or malignant tumors. In addition to patient characteristics, the determination of primary and nodal target volumes depends on tumor extensions and stage, histology and grade. Therefore, radiotherapy of salivary gland tumors requires a certain degree of personalization, which has been codified in the recommendations of the French multidisciplinary network of expertise for rare ENT cancers (Refcor) and may justify a specialised multidisciplinary discussion. Although radiotherapy is usually recommended for malignant tumours only, recurrent pleomorphic adenomas may sometimes require radiotherapy based on multidisciplinary discussion. An update of indications and recommendations for radiotherapy for salivary gland tumours in terms of techniques, doses, target volumes and dose constraints to organs at risk of the French society for radiotherapy and oncology (SFRO) was reported in this article.","49":null,"50":"","51":null,"52":"Gliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumour. The proximity of organs at risk, the infiltrating nature, and the radioresistance of gliomas have to be taken into account in the choice of prescribed dose and technique of radiotherapy. The management of glioma patients is based on clinical factors (age, KPS) and tumour characteristics (histology, molecular biology, tumour location), and strongly depends on available and associated treatments, such as surgery, radiation therapy, and chemotherapy. The knowledge of molecular biomarkers is currently essential, they are increasingly evolving as additional factors that facilitate diagnostics and therapeutic decision-making. We present the update of the recommendations of the French society for radiation oncology on the indications and the technical procedures for performing radiation therapy in patients with gliomas.","53":"We present the update of the recommendations of the French society of radiotherapy and oncology on the indications and the technical methods of carrying out radiotherapy of sinonasal cancers. Sinonasal cancers (nasal fossae and sinus) account for 3 to 5% of all cancers of the head and neck. They include carcinomas, mucosal melanomas, sarcomas and lymphomas. The management of sinonasal cancers is multidisciplinary but less standardized than that of squamous cell carcinomas of the upper aerodigestive tract. As such, patients with sinonasal tumors can benefit from the expertise of the French expertise network for rare ENT cancers (Refcor). Knowledge of sinonasal tumour characteristics (histology, grade, risk of lymph node involvement, molecular characterization, type of surgery) is critical to the determination of target volumes. An update of multidisciplinary indications and recommendations for radiotherapy in terms of techniques, target volumes and radiotherapy fractionation of the French society of radiotherapy and oncology (SFRO) was reported in this manuscript.","54":"Radiotherapy alone or in association with systemic treatment plays a major role in the treatment of head and neck tumours, either as a primary treatment or as a postoperative modality. The management of these tumours is multidisciplinary, requiring particular care at every treatment step. We present the update of the recommendations of the French Society of Radiation Oncology on the radiotherapy of head and neck tumours from the imaging work-up needed for optimal selection of treatment volume, to optimization of the dose distribution and delivery.","55":null,"56":"The purpose of this article is to describe the regulatory framework of the radiotherapy practice in France.","57":"This article reviews the various treatment options, by primary or postoperative external radiotherapy and by brachytherapy for the p16-negative oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma. Dose levels, fractionation and association with systemic treatments are presented. The need for neck node dissection post local treatment is discussed, as well as specificities for the management of p16-positive tumours. Guidelines for target volume selection and delineation are thoroughly elaborated. Last, the management by radiotherapy of locoregional recurrences is discussed.","58":null,"59":"The purpose of the first two editions of the guidelines for external radiotherapy procedures, published in 2007 and 2016 respectively, was to issue recommendations aimed at optimising, harmonising and standardising practices. The purpose of this third edition, which includes brachytherapy, is identical while also taking into account recent technological improvements (intensity modulation radiation therapy, stereotactic radiotherapy, and three-dimension brachytherapy) along with findings from literature. Part one describes the daily use of general principles (quality, security, image-guided radiation therapy); part two describes each treatment step for the main types of cancer.","60":"The 2020 recommendations for good brachytherapy procedures (\"Recorad\") are updated based on the 2016 article. This new brachytherapy article took into account recent data published in the literature as well as international recommendations. The different brachytherapy steps are successively described from the treatment preparation (brachytherapy technique prescription; procedure and material, dedicated images for planification, dose distribution analysis and validation) to the end of the procedure as well as post-treatment surveillance.","61":"We present the update of the recommendations of the French society of oncological radiotherapy on respiratory motion management for external radiotherapy treatment. Since twenty years and the report 62 of ICRU, motion management during the course of radiotherapy treatment has become an increasingly significant concern, particularly with the development of hypofractionated treatments under stereotactic conditions, using reduced safety margins. This article related orders of motion amplitudes for different organs as well as the definition of the margins in radiotherapy. An updated review of the various movement management strategies is presented as well as main technological solutions enabling them to be implemented: when acquiring anatomical data, during planning and when carrying out treatment. Finally, the management of these moving targets, such as it can be carried out in radiotherapy departments, will be detailed for a few concrete examples of localizations (abdominal, thoracic and hepatic).","62":"We present the updated recommendations of the French society for radiation oncology on radiotherapy and pregnancy. The occurrence of cancer during pregnancy is a rare event (approximately 1 in 1000 pregnancies). The risks for the embryo or the foetus depend on the gestational age at the time of irradiation. The main risks are malformations with microcephaly and mental retardation. There is also a risk of radiation-induced cancer in the unborn child. In the case of only supradiaphragmatic irradiation, radiotherapy can be performed most often in pregnant women without risk to the foetus. On the other hand, in the case of an indication for subdiaphragmatic irradiation, therapeutic termination of the pregnancy should be proposed. In all cases, when radiotherapy is chosen, a phantom estimation of the dose delivered to the foetus, confirmed by in vivo measurement, is recommended. Conformational radiotherapy is the preferred technique because of the lower dose delivered to the foetus (except in tumour locations where other techniques such as IMRT are recommended).","63":"The issue of radiation-induced cancers must be taken into consideration during therapeutic irradiations. Risk factors for radiation-induced cancer include: the age of the patients, the volumes irradiated, the presence of risk cofactors and the exposure of critical organs. Those should be part of the therapeutic decision, in terms of indication, as well as choice of the radiotherapy technique (including repositioning systems). We present the update of the recommendations of the French society for radiation oncology on the modalities for preventing radiation-induced cancers.","64":"The delineation of organs at risk is the basis of radiotherapy oncologists' work. Indeed, the knowledge of this delineation enables to better identify the target volumes and to optimize dose distribution, involving the prognosis of the patients but also their future. The learning of this delineation must continue throughout the clinician's career. Some contour changes have appeared with better imaging, some volumes are now required due to development of knowledge of side effects. In addition, the increasing survival time of patients requires to be more systematic and precise in the delineations, both to avoid complications until now exceptional but also because re-irradiations are becoming more and more frequent. We present the update of the recommendations of the French Society for Radiation Oncology (SFRO) on new findings or adaptations to volumes at risk.","65":"The RadioTransNet programme launched under the auspices of French societies for radiation oncology (SFRO) and medical physics (SFPM) was approved by the French national cancer institute (INCa) in December 2018 and is dedicated to proposing a relevant national and transversal structure for preclinical research including translational research in radiation oncology with well-defined priority areas of research. Its activities, coordinated by a scientific committee that includes radiation oncologists, medical physicists, academic biologists, are structured around several main areas, i.e.: target volume definition, interaction of radiation with normal tissues, combined treatments and modern dose calculation approaches. Four work packages have been created in these areas and are associated with other objectives pertaining to fundamental radiobiology, early implementation of new drugs in a preclinical setting, contribution of imaging in this task, research in medical physics including transversal components such as medical oncology, radiology, nuclear medicine and also cost\/efficiency evaluation. All these tasks will be included in a national network that uses the complementary expertise provided by partners involved in the scheme. Calls for proposals will be selected by the scientific council to be submitted to INCa and the various academic associations to obtain funding for the human and technical resources required to conduct under optimal conditions projects in preclinical and translational research in radiation-oncology.","66":"The aim of the review was to present the current literature status about replanning regarding anatomical and dosimetric changes in the target and OARs in the head and neck region during radiotherapy, to discuss and to analyze factors influencing the decision for adaptive radiotherapy of head and neck cancer patients. Significant progress has been made in head and neck patients' evaluation and qualification for adapted radiotherapy over the past ten years. Many factors leading to anatomical and dosimetric changes during treatment have been identified. Based on the literature, the most common factors triggering re-plan are weight loss, tumor and nodal changes, and parotid glands shrinkage. The fluctuations in dose distribution in the clinical area are significant predictive factors for patients' quality of life and the possibility of recovery. It has been shown that re-planning influence clinical outcomes: local control, disease free survival and overall survival. Regarding literature studies, it seems that adaptive radiotherapy would be the most beneficial for tumors of immense volume or those in the nearest proximity of the OARs. All researchers agree that the timing of re-planning is a crucial challenge, and there are still no clear consensus guidelines for time or criteria of re-planning. Nowadays, thanks to significant technological progress, the decision is mostly made based on observation and supported with IGRT verification. Although further research is still needed, adaptive strategies are evolving and now became the state of the art of modern radiotherapy.","67":"Adjuvant radiotherapy is one of the major anticancer treatments in early breast cancer patients. Acute and late radio-induced effects may occur during or after breast cancer radiotherapy, and their medical management is a major issue for radiation oncologists. Here, the present review of literature embraces complementary non-pharmacological interventions, which could be combined to adjuvant radiotherapy in order to improve patients care.","68":"Stereotaxic radiotherapy is performed regularly for the irradiation of non-spine bone metastases, but its place is not well understood. This article in stereotaxic radiotherapy of non-spine bones oligometastases presents the current scientific data relating to the indications, to virtual simulation, to the delineation of target volumes, to the total dose and fractionation, to the efficacy and tolerance. Oligometastatic patients are classified into 4 categories: oligorecurrences, oligometastasis, oligopersistence, oligoprogression. The prognosis will be evaluated according to the following characteristics: primary tumor, quantitative characteristics, kinetics, qualitative characteristics. The delineation of GTV includes extensions to the soft tissue and bone marrow with the aid of MRI and PET. The CTV corresponds to a margin of 2 to 5mm and the PTV to a margin of 2mm. The most widely used irradiation schemes are: 1 single fraction of 18 to 24Gy\/1 fr; 24Gy\/2 fr; 27 to 30Gy\/3 fr; 30 to 35Gy\/5 fr. Stereotaxis provides 90% local control at 1 year and good pain control. The side effects are not very marked. Stereotaxic radiotherapy is feasible, non-invasive, minimally toxic and effective with good local control and good pain relief. The main issue remains selecting the patients most likely to benefit from it. ","69":"Surface-guided radiotherapy is useful for the pre-positioning and monitoring of radiotherapy. The purpose of this study was to investigate the impact of surface guidance on the repeatability of patient localization and to estimate the specific point at which high positional errors occur. Ten patients without the VOXELAN system (non-VXLN group) and 10 patients with the VOXELAN as the pre-positioning procedure (VXLN group) were included in this analysis. Twelve regions of interest (ROI) were defined in all the patients to verify any misalignment during radiotherapy. Thirteen ROIs were defined on the isocenter. Compared with the non-VXLN group, the translational positional errors of the VXLN group were the same for all the ROIs. The mean translational positional errors of the VXLN group in the longitudinal direction were approximately 0.1mm, and the standard deviation was the largest among the three directions in all the ROIs. The magnitude of the standard deviation in the non-VXLN group varied independently of the ROI and direction. The standard deviations of the VXLN group in the longitudinal direction were large in all the ROIs, while the standard deviations in the vertical and lateral directions were small. Pre-positioning with a surface guidance system reduced the body twist and rotation, which could not be corrected by image-guided radiotherapy alone. Since the VOXELAN can detect positioning errors quickly and without additional radiation exposure to the patient, it can be used as a tool for pre-positioning in radiotherapy. ","70":null,"71":"Thoracic irradiation requires protection of the heart as an organ at risk of complications. The mean heart dose is the most studied dosimetric parameter in the literature. Recent studies question its relevance in view of the multiplicity of cardiac injuries, the heterogeneity of the cardiac dose distribution and the current technical possibilities to refine cardiac dosimetric protection. The objective of this literature review is to analyze the available scientific data on the impact of the dose received by the cardiac substructures. A search of articles using the PubMed search engine was used to select the most relevant studies. A total of 19 articles were selected according to pre-established criteria to answer the issue. Several studies found significant associations between dosimetric parameters of substructures and clinical cardiological impact. Some proposed dose constraints for substructures.","72":"Data on the incidence and severity of radiation-induced toxicity in patients with systemic and\/or cutaneous lupus erythematosus (SLE\/CLE) are very limited. After reporting the case of a patient who experienced major toxicity and CLE flare in the irradiated area following breast irradiation, we conducted a comprehensive literature review of available data in this setting. The few retrospectives studies which have evaluated both the risk of toxicity in SLE\/CLE patients and\/or the potential induction or reactivation of SLE\/CLE with radiotherapy have not shown differences between SLE\/CLE patients and controls. Several other factors such as concurrent chemotherapy, a particular genetic background, or lupus treatments (essentially hydroxychloroquine) can explain severe radiation-induced toxicity. Therefore, patients with SLE\/CLE should be irradiated like patients without SLE\/CLE, with close monitoring during radiotherapy if other risk factors exist. Further studies examining a larger number of patients would probably allow a better understanding of the radiosensitivity of these patients.","73":"In order to provide more convenient irradiation regimens for patient comfort, radiation facility organization and health expenses, new hypofractionated protocols have been evaluated. Moderately (dose\/fraction: 2.3 to 3Gy), then ultra (dose\/fraction: 5.2 to 6.1Gy) hypofractionated irradiations were first validated. The current question is: is it possible to go forward using extreme hypofractionated regimens (EHR) based on 1 to 3 fractions. Different irradiation techniques are under investigation. However, brachytherapy remains the smartest way to deliver a high dose in a small volume. We report prospective and retrospective study results which evaluated EHR for breast and prostate brachytherapy. While oncological outcome and toxicity profile appear extremely encouraging for low-risk breast cancer after a 1 to 4 fractions (6.25 to 20Gy\/fraction), the use of a single fraction of 19 to 23Gy appears debatable for prostate cancer. Brachytherapy represents an emblematic example of EHR but longer follow-up and more mature results are awaited in order to specify the right indications and refine the EQD2 calculation method including new biological and technical factors.","74":"Stereotactic radiotherapy is an ever more common technique, regardless of the location treated. However, spinal stereotactic radiotherapy requires a particular technicality in order to ensure its proper realization. There is now a large literature defining the type of imaging to be used, the dose to be delivered and the delineation of target volumes. This technique can achieve a significant local control and an interesting analgesic efficiency. However, its place in relation to conventional radiotherapy remains limited because it requires MRI imaging and a significantly longer patient management during the treatment fraction. In this context, it is currently mainly restricted to oligometastatic patients or for re-irradiations.","75":"The technological advancement heralded the arrival of precision radiotherapy (RT), thereby increasing the therapeutic ratio and decreasing the side effects from treatment. Contour of target volumes (TV) and organs at risk (OARs) in RT is a complicated process. In recent years, automatic contouring of TV and OARs has rapidly developed due to the advances in deep learning (DL). This technology has the potential to save time and to reduce intra- or inter-observer variability. In this paper, the authors provide an overview of RT, introduce the concept of DL, summarize the data characteristics of the included literature, summarize the possible challenges for DL in the future, and discuss the possible research directions.","76":"Evaluate efficacy and toxicity of hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy (HSRT) for patients treated for pituitary adenoma (PA) with an alternative HSRT escalating protocol delivering 35Gy in 5 fractions. From June 2007 to March 2017, 29 patients with pituitary adenoma were treated in Antoine Lacassagne Cancer Centre with an alternative HSRT protocol. Prescribed dose was 35Gy in 5 fractions of 7Gy. Radiographic responses were assessed by annual MRI. Hormone blood samples were evaluated each year after HSRT. A total of 29 patients aged between 23 and 86 years (median 54 years) were included. Twelve patients received HSRT for recurrent cases and 12 received postoperative adjuvant HSRT, 5 patients did not have surgery. After a median follow-up period of 47 months local control rate was 96%. One patient presented an out-field tumor regrowth 73 months after HSRT. The majority of PA were endocrine-active (18 patients, 62%). After HSRT, 8 patients (44%) presented complete response on initial secretion, 4 patients (23%) presented partial response on initial secretion. Four patients (14%) presented grade 2 or more acute radiation toxicities. One grade 4 visual disorder was observed for one patient. HSRT delivering 35Gy in 5 fractions represents a feasible treatment and shows promising results to reduce hormonal overproduction and to improve local control in PA. ","77":"Oncosexuality has recently become a new supportive care mission. Sexual morbidity is, routinely, underestimated and must be questioned. We report here the most frequent disorders for men and for women, how to prevent them and how to treat them.","78":"Chemoradiotherapy with concurrent cisplatin has been the standard treatment for locally advanced head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) for over 20 years. Recently, immunotherapy, a new therapeutic class, has emerged for patients with recurrent or metastatic HNSCC and has significantly extended their survival. Will it bring the same benefit to patients with localized tumors? There is a strong rationale for combining radiation therapy and checkpoint inhibitors for HNSCC. Indeed, radiation therapy can have both immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory effects. This is what explains the famous abscopal effect. The aim of this review is to present the data available on the combination of radiation therapy and immunotherapy for HNSCC.","79":"Interstitial brachytherapy is indicated as part of a conservative strategy for children with bladder and\/or prostate rhabdomyosarcoma (RMS), providing high local control probability with acceptable functional results. Vaginal and\/or rectal complications were however reported, due to the close proximity to the implanted volume. We investigated the dosimetric impact of a vaginal spacer in terms of rectal and vaginal doses. Medical records of 12 consecutive female patients with bladder neck RMS, median age 32 months (range: 1.3-6 years), were reviewed. Five patients were treated prior to 2017 without a vaginal spacer and seven patients treated after 2017 had their brachytherapy delivered with a vaginal spacer placed at time of implant. Minimal doses delivered to the most exposed 2cm3, 1cm3, and 0.5cm3 of the rectum were all statistically significantly lower among patients treated with a vaginal spacer, as compared to those treated without a spacer. Median rectal D2cm3 was 22GyEQD2 versus 38GyEQD2 (P=0.02), D1cm3 was 29GyEQD2 versus 51GyEQD2 (P=0.013), and D0.5cm3 was 32GyEQD2 versus 61GyEQD2 (P=0.017), with and without the vaginal spacer, respectively. The posterior vaginal wall D0.5cm3 dose was also significantly decreased, with median D0.5cm3 of 92GyEQD2 versus 54GyEQD2 (P&lt;0.0001), with and without the spacer, respectively. Acute tolerance was excellent in all patients, with no need for replanning and no acute complication. The use of vaginal spacers in brachytherapy of female pediatric patients with bladder neck RMS resulted in significantly decreased doses to the rectum and the posterior vaginal wall. Though the clinical impact of such dose reduction remains undemonstrated, routine utilization of a vaginal spacer could be a method to decrease long-term morbidity in these patients. ","80":null,"81":"Because of the physical properties of proton beam radiation therapy (PT), which allows energy to be deposited at a specific depth with a rapid energy fall-off beyond that depth, PT has several theoretical advantages over photon radiation therapy for esophageal cancer (EC). Protons have the potential to reduce the dose to healthy tissue and to more safely allow treatment of tumors near critical organs, dose escalation, trimodal treatment, and re-irradiation. In recent years, larger multicenter retrospective studies have been published showing excellent survival rates, lower than expected toxicities and even better outcomes with PT than with photon radiotherapy even using IMRT or VMAT techniques. Although PT was associated with reduced toxicities, postoperative complications, and hospital stays compared to photon radiation therapy, these studies all had inherent biases in relation with patient selection for PT. These observations were recently confirmed by a randomized phase II study in locally advanced EC that showed significantly reduced toxicities with protons compared with IMRT. Currently, two randomized phase III trials (NRG-GI006 in the US and PROTECT in Europe) are being conducted to confirm whether protons could become the standard of care in locally advanced and resectable esophageal cancers.","82":"To identify from the current literature when is the right time to replan and to assign thresholds for the optimum process of replanning. Nowadays, adaptive radiotherapy (ART) for head and neck cancer plays an exceptional role consisting of an evaluation procedure of the prominent anatomical and dosimetric variations. By performing complex radiotherapy methods, the credibility of the therapeutic result is crucial. Image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) was developed to ensure locoregional control and thus changes that might occur during radiotherapy be dealt with. An electronic research of articles published in PubMed\/MEDLINE and Science Direct databases from January 2004 to October 2020 was performed. Among a total of 127 studies assessed for eligibility, 85 articles were ultimately retained for the review. The most noticeable changes have been reported in the middle fraction of the treatment. Therefore, the suggested optimal time to replan is between the third and the fourth week. Anatomical deviations&gt;1cm in the external contour, average weight loss&gt;10%, violation in the dose coverage of the targets&gt;5%, and violation in the dose of the peripherals were some of the thresholds that are currently used, and which lead to replanning. ART may decrease toxicity and improve local-control. Whether it is beneficial or not, depends ultimately on each patient. However, more investigation of the changes should be performed in future prospective studies to obtain more accurate results. ","83":"A Benchmark Case (BC) was performed as part of the quality assurance process of the randomized phase 2 GORTEC 2014-14 OMET study, testing the possibility of multisite stereotactic radiation therapy (SBRT) alone in oligometastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNSCC) as an alternative to systemic treatment and SBRT. Compliance of the investigating centers with the prescription, delineation, planning and evaluation recommendations available in the research protocol was assessed. In addition, classical dosimetric analysis was supplemented by quantitative geometric analysis using conformation indices. Twenty centers participated in the BC analysis. Among them, four major deviations (MaD) were reported in two centers. Two (10%) centers in MaD had omitted the satellite tumor nodule and secondarily validated after revision. Their respective DICE indexes were 0.37 and 0 and use of extracranial SBRT devices suboptimal There were significant residual heterogeneities between participating centers, including those with a similar SBRT equipment, with impact of plan quality using standard indicators and geometric indices. A priori QA using a BC conditioning the participation of the clinical investigation centers showed deviations from good SBRT practice and led to the exclusion of one out of the twenty participating centers. The majority of centers have demonstrated rigorous compliance with the research protocol. The use of quality indexes adds a complementary approach to improve assessment of plan quality. ","84":"The abscopal effect has been mentioned since 1953. The increase in knowledge about the immune system and the development of immunotherapies support its potential therapeutic interest. While it is accepted that radiotherapy induces an immune response, demonstrating its systemic impact is not easy. The preclinical basis is solid but its clinical validation pending. Radiotherapy rarely induces tumor reduction at a distance from the beams, probably due to its immunosuppressive effect. This is why a synergy between radiotherapy and systemic treatments targeting these immunosuppressive mechanisms was observed. Several parameters can modulate the induction of the abscopal effect. Among these, the fractionation of the dose seems to be determining with currently a pre-eminence of hypofractionated stereotaxis. On the other hand, even if the choice of more immunogenic targets (liver, lung) should be favoured, the optimal number of lesions to be irradiated remains to be defined as well as the minimum volume allowing sufficient release of tumor antigens. The impact of radiation-induced lymphopenia on radiotherapy\/immunotherapy efficacy needs to be assessed more precisely, as does the effect of radiotherapy techniques on them. Finally, the choice of immunotherapy(ies) and the combination regimen with radiotherapy remain under discussion. A sequential scheme appears to provide less toxicities but the concomitant would lead to a better response. The study of these different parameters should allow us to deliver optimized radiotherapy\/immunotherapy(ies) combinations to our metastatic patients in order to benefit as many people as possible from this abscopal effect.","85":"The management of myeloid and lymphoid disease is essentially based on chemotherapy and targeted therapies. Since radiotherapy could be responsible for severe late toxicities, essentially due to conventional bidimensional irradiation techniques, many trials have attempted to omit radiotherapy or to scale down the dose in their therapeutic strategy. Nevertheless, radiotherapy still plays a role for curative or symptomatic purposes.","86":"Moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy has become routine practice for a selected population of patients treated for early-stage breast cancer. In April 2020, the Fast Forward (FF) study was published which introduced another extreme hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen in five sessions over a week. The aim of this work is to evaluate the population of first patients in whom this regimen was used in our department, as well as the results in terms of early toxicity. We retrospectively analysed all the patients treated in our department according to the Fast Forward protocol after establishing an institutional consensus regarding the selection of patients with breast cancer without indication for lymph node irradiation. All patients received breast-only irradiation at a total dose of 26Gy in five fractions according to protocol. All patients were treated by modern conformational techniques with planning large volume coverage between 95 and 100%. Acute toxicity of the treatment was assessed using the NCI CTC v4.0 scale and the general condition was assessed according to the WHO classification. Between August 2020 and May 2021, 30 patients were included, treated on the breast alone without complement on the tumour bed or irradiation of the lymph node areas. The median age of the patients was 80years (range: 60-85years) with performance status 2 in 27 cases (89%). Only one patient had metastatic disease (3%), one patient presented locally advanced and 28 (94%) patients had early stage disease. Three patients (10%) were treated in dorsal decubitus according to the \"field in the field\" technique and 27 patients (90%) in isocentric lateral decubitus, which made it possible to avoid the organs at risk such as the heart (average dose of less than 1Gy) and the lungs. The early toxicity observed was grade I radio dermatitis in 8 patients (27%). No grade 2 and 3 toxicity, as well as radiation-induced pain or lymphedema were observed. The results of this series of patients treated with hypofractionated radiotherapy according to the Fast Forward protocol on the breast alone with adapted techniques show that the protocol is feasible, with little early toxicity but a greater follow-up is necessary to assess long-term toxicity. ","87":"Stereotactic radiotherapy is used for patients with oligometastases from colorectal cancer. It results in good local tumour control, especially for hepatic and pulmonary metastases, subject to a sufficiently high biologically effective dose, and is well-tolerated. It can be associated with other local treatments such as surgery or radiofrequency as part of combined treatments, in order to increase patient survival.","88":"Due to the continuously increasing number of newly diagnosed breast cancer and limited health resources hypofractionated radiotherapy is a major topic. Recent results from randomized clinical trials assessing extreme hypofractionated radiotherapy for whole or partial breast radiotherapy are practice changing. Here we report toxicity and oncological outcomes from major recent trials of extreme hypofractionated breast irradiation and present an ongoing prospective implementation program. For whole breast irradiation, with a 10 years follow up, the UK-FAST trial demonstrated no significant difference in toxicity between a once weekly 5 fractions (5,7Gy\/fr) regimen and a conventional 50Gy\/25fr regimen. With a 5 years follow up, the FAST-Forward trial showed non inferiority on local control for a 5 fractions over 1 week (5,2Gy\/fr) regimen versus standard 40Gy\/15fr over 3 weeks with safe toxicity profile. For accelerated partial breast irradiation, in low-risk breast cancers patients, several phase III randomized trials confirmed that extreme hypofractionation is a valid option. With our \"One Week Breast Radiotherapy\" program, we propose the implementation of a one-week full workflow preparing and delivering 5 fractions over 1 week (26Gy) in selected patients with prospective follow-up. Several extreme hypofractionated breast radiotherapy regimens are validated and can be routinely discussed with patients in a share decision-making process following patient selection criteria and dosimetric constraints.","89":"Management of high-risk prostate cancers is still a subject of debate, because of the lack of randomized trial comparing surgery and radiotherapy. If external beam radiotherapy is proposed, it must be associated with a long-term androgen deprivation therapy, at least 18-months. Irradiation of pelvic lymph nodes seems to improve distant metastasis-free survival and is so indicated in most of the cases. Moderate hypofractionation is not validated for pelvic lymph nodes irradiation. A combination of external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy improved biochemical control in randomized trials without impact on survival. But this combination has been evaluated in large retrospective studies and seems to improve specific and overall survivals. An integrated boost on the MRI-defined index lesion is another way of dose escalation and improved also biochemical control. Stereotactic radiotherapy is not a validated option at this moment. For each patient, according to the extension of the disease, age, comorbidities and also his willingness, the best approach must be chosen, ideally in multidisciplinary meeting.","90":"In the management of prostate cancer in recent years, innovative therapies have appeared requiring precise and reliable disease detection. In 2021, new generation imaging (PET\/CT, multiparametric MRI, PET\/MRI) have their place at all stages of the prostate cancer natural history to help target the lesion(s) and guide therapy and improve the results obtained. PSMA PET\/CT is currently the leader in this type of imaging with a complete offer during the disease: both from diagnosis, to recurrence or in the oligo-metastatic and metastatic stage resistant to castration with a pivotal role in the PSMA theranostic approach. However, multiparametric MRI also has many detection advantages when the prostate is left in place, which suggests the potential major benefit of hybrid PSMA PET\/MRI imaging.","91":"Basal cell carcinomas and cutaneous squamous cell carcinomas are among the most common cancerous tumors in the world. Their treatment is most often based on surgery. Adjuvant radiotherapy may be indicated in case of risk factors for recurrence or as an alternative to surgery if surgery is not feasible due to the patient's advanced age and\/or co-morbidities or as an alternative to potentially mutilating surgery. Radiotherapy is also part of the therapeutic arsenal for rarer skin tumors such as Merkel cell carcinoma, cutaneous lymphomas, Kaposi's disease and cutaneous adnexal carcinomas.","92":null,"93":"In 2021, the Ethics Commission of the SFRO has chosen the issue of the practice of palliative care in radiotherapy oncology. Radiation oncology plays a central role in the care of patients with cancer in palliative phase. But behind the broad name of palliative radiotherapy, we actually find a large variety of situations involving diverse ethical issues. Radiation oncologists have the delicate task to take into account multiple factors throughout a complex decision-making process. While the question of the therapeutic indication and the technical choice allowing it to be implemented remains central, reflection cannot be limited to these decision-making and technical aspects alone. It is also a question of being able to create the conditions for a singularity focused care and to build an authentic care relationship, beyond technicity. It is through this daily ethical work, in close collaboration with patients, and under essential conditions of multidisciplinarity and multiprofessionalism, that our fundamental role as caregiver can be deployed.","94":"Oligometastatic prostate cancer is among the most studied oligometastatic cancers in the literature. However few prospective studies have assessed stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) for prostate cancer oligometastases. Two randomised phase II trials show a progression-free survival benefit compared with observation. Prospective registry data show very good local control and low toxicity too. Inclusion in ongoing trials should be strongly encouraged to define the role of SBRT in addition to systemic therapy. Radiation therapy to the primary tumour has been studied in randomised trials and provides an overall survival benefit in patients with low metastatic burden. The benefit is inversely correlated with the number of bone lesions using conventional imaging, up to three metastases. Radiotherapy to the primary tumour is recommended by the learned societies for patients with low metastatic burden. Its role in combination with second generation anti androgen therapy needs to be clarified.","95":"While there is no high-level evidence showing superiority of surgery over radiation treatment, radical prostatectomy is the most common treatment option for patients with localized, non-metastatic disease. Nearly 30% of all patients undergoing surgery will develop a biochemical recurrence in 10 years. In fact, more than 30% of contemporary patients treated with RP will harbor aggressive disease characteristics at final pathology. We conducted a review of the literature evaluating the timing of radiotherapy and the place of androgen deprivation after prostatectomie totale. Four trials randomizing adjuvant radiotherapy and surveillance found an advantage in biochemical relapse-free survival in favor of immediate irradiation after radical prostatectomy, called adjuvant. However, in these studies, more than 40% of patients in the arm without adjuvant radiotherapy did not relapse at 10 years of follow-up. More recently, the question of the optimal time of this post-operative, adjuvant RT or during biological relapse has arisen through three trials (RADICALS-RT, RAVES, GETUG-AFU 17). These trials did not show a benefit for adjuvant radiotherapy in terms of event-free survival, a PSA-based endpoint, while confirming the toxicities observed during irradiation immediately after surgery. The optimal duration of hormonal therapy when associated with post-prostatectomy radiation therapy remains controversial. Early salvage radiotherapy is a new standard of treatment and adjuvant radiotherapy could be reserved for very selected patients. The role of hormone therapy is well defined in salvage situation, but its duration is still being studied. ","96":"Numerous clinical studies aim to integrate immunotherapy in radiotherapy oncology, either for generating abscopal responses in metastatic patients in combination with radiotherapy, or in the treatment of a locally advanced tumor. The search for biomarkers of response to treatment is a major axis in the development of these therapeutic combinations, to allow the early identification of patients who will benefit from the treatment, in the context of an increasingly personalized approach. We review some of the strategies that can be applied for personalization to combined radiotherapy and immunotherapy treatments.","97":"The aim of this article is to review unrecognized toxicities resulting from radiation therapy of digestive neoplasms. Due to their precocious occurrence, acute toxicities are well-known by radiation oncologist, and their treatment well-established. Thus, acute toxicities will not be described in this review. We will focus on incidence, diagnosis, and management of late and uncommon toxicities occurring in the digestive tract and digestive organs. Prevention, by respecting healthy tissues constraints, is the main tool to reduce incidence of those rare complications. Nonetheless, once installed, late toxicities remain a major burden in terms of quality of life and can even be life threatening. Hence, information and education about their diagnosis and management is important.","98":"Immunotherapy occupies a growing place in urologic oncology, mainly for kidney and bladder cancers. On the basis of encouraging preclinical work, the combination of immunotherapy with radiotherapy aims to increase the tumor response, including in metastatic tumors, which raises many hopes, which this article reviews.","99":"Deep-learning (DL)-based auto-contouring solutions have recently been proposed as a convincing alternative to decrease workload of target volumes and organs-at-risk (OAR) delineation in radiotherapy planning and improve inter-observer consistency. However, there is minimal literature of clinical implementations of such algorithms in a clinical routine. In this paper we first present an update of the state-of-the-art of DL-based solutions. We then summarize recent recommendations proposed by the European society for radiotherapy and oncology (ESTRO) to be followed before any clinical implementation of artificial intelligence-based solutions in clinic. The last section describes the methodology carried out by three French radiation oncology departments to deploy CE-marked commercial solutions. Based on the information collected, a majority of OAR are retained by the centers among those proposed by the manufacturers, validating the usefulness of DL-based models to decrease clinicians' workload. Target volumes, with the exception of lymph node areas in breast, head and neck and pelvic regions, whole breast, breast wall, prostate and seminal vesicles, are not available in the three commercial solutions at this time. No implemented workflows are currently available to continuously improve the models, but these can be adapted\/retrained in some solutions during the commissioning phase to best fit local practices. In reported experiences, automatic workflows were implemented to limit human interactions and make the workflow more fluid. Recommendations published by the ESTRO group will be of importance for guiding physicists in the clinical implementation of patient specific and regular quality assurances.","100":"We report our experience of 86 consecutive patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma who were treated with volumetric modulated arc therapy. We retrospectively reviewed the medical records of 86 patients with histologically proven primary nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated with volumetric modulated arctherapy technique radiotherapy. Primary endpoints were local, regional, distant control, and overall survival, second endpoint was late toxicity. The median age was 47.5 years (range: 13-79 years) with sex ratio 1.09. At diagnosis, rhinologic symptoms represented the most common clinical presentation, reported by 61 patients (70.9%). Almost 88.4% of patients presented non-keratinizing undifferentiated carcinoma histology (n=76). Most of the patients presented a locally advanced disease defined by stage III and IVa (95.3%). Therefore, 31 patients were treated by concurrent chemoradiation (36%), 52 patients received induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy (57%), three patients received induction chemotherapy followed by exclusive radiotherapy (3.5%). and three patients treated with exclusive irradiation (3.5%). With a median follow up of 15.7 months (range: 4-33.3 months), nine patients died (10.4%), three presented local or locoregional relapse (3.4%), while nine patients presented distant recurrences (10.4%). The two years overall and disease-free survival rates were 88.7% and 83.1% respectively, locoregional control was 100% at 12 months and 96.2% at 24 months, and the two years distant failure-free survival was 86.7%. Time to relapse was the only prognostic factor in univariate analysis for overall survival in our study. The therapeutic tolerance was good with 61.7% of grade 3 and 2.3% grade 4 hyposialia respectively, 46.5% of otological disorders and no radionecrosis was noted. Volumetric modulated arctherapy technique with concurrent chemoradiotherapy is an effective treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma with excellent overall and locoregional control without severe toxicity. Distant metastasis is the major site of failure, so induction chemotherapy added to chemoradiotherapy must be discussed in multidisciplinary consultation meeting because it significantly improved recurrence-free survival and overall survival, as compared with chemoradiotherapy alone. ","101":"We present the results of the PHRC Tridicol, a prospective French phase II study whose objective was to increase the dose delivered to the target volume during brachytherapy for locally advanced cervical cancers. Eight centers included 48 patients, treated with concomitant radiochemotherapy, then uterovaginal brachytherapy. The median follow-up was 63 months. The dose of brachytherapy delivered in biological equivalent dose (EQD2) to 90% of the High Risk CTV (D90 CTV HR) was 80Gy in median dose. The 5-year local control rate (LC) was 84%, close to the hypothesis of 86.7%. The rate of severe complications (grade 3-4) was 23% at 5 years. The rectal dose was correlated with the risk of severe complications. HR CTV dose was below the target (85Gy) due to low use of parametrial interstitial needles, as the centers did not always have an adequate applicator, or were at the time at the beginning of their learning curve. The 5-year LC rate was improved compared to that of the comparable STIC PDR group (78%) but lower than the retroEMBRACE cohort of GEC ESTRO (89%). The complication rate was higher than in the comparable group of STIC PDR but close to that of retroEMBRACE. Training brachytherapy teams in interstitial implantation or referring patients to referral centers should help improve the therapeutic index of cervical cancer. ","102":"Pancreatic cancer has poor prognosis and a continuously growing incidence. By 2030, it should become the second cause of death by cancer worldwide and in France. The only curative treatment is surgery that is achievable in only 20% of patients at the time of initial diagnosis, with a high rate of incomplete resection. Neoadjuvant treatments using chemotherapy with or without radiotherapy are more often admitted to play an important role by selecting non-progressing cases who will benefit from surgery, by increasing the number of complete resection, and by making locally advanced and borderline tumours accessible to resection. However, the role of radiotherapy is still debated. Because of its dosimetric advantages, its short total duration, and its good tolerance with reduced volumes of irradiation, stereotactic radiotherapy has been largely studied. Compared to chemoradiotherapy, this technique could improve the therapeutic index helping to preserve the general status of patients in order to give them access to secondary surgery. It remains a promising technique still under evaluation, to be delivered ideally, as part of a clinical trial, or within an experimented team.","103":"Artificial intelligence approaches in medicine are more and more used and are extremely promising due to the growing number of data produced and the variety of data they allow to exploit. Thus, the computational analysis of medical images in particular, radiological (radiomics), or anatomopathological (pathomics), has shown many very interesting results for the prediction of the prognosis and the response of cancer patients. Radiotherapy is a discipline that particularly benefits from these new approaches based on computer science and imaging. This review will present the main principles of an artificial intelligence approach and in particular machine learning, the principles of a radiomic and pathomic approach and the potential of their use for the prediction of the prognosis of patients treated with radiotherapy.","104":"Reirradiation and irradiation of sarcoma is often difficult due to the frequent need for a high dose of radiation in order to increase tumor control. This can result in a greater risk of toxicity which can be mitigated with the use of proton therapy. The present review aims to summarize the role of proton therapy in these 2 clinical contexts.","105":"The quality of life of patients and its evaluation remains one of the primordial objectives in oncology. Different methods and tools of evaluation of quality of life have been developed with the objective of having a global evaluation, throughout different aspects, be it physical, emotional, psychological or social. The quality of life questionnaires improve and simplify the reevaluation and follow-up of patients during clinical trials. Patient reported outcome measures (PROMs) are an evaluation of the quality of life as experienced by the patients (patient-reported-outcomes [PROs]) and allow for physicians a personalized treatment approach. In radiotherapy, PROMs are a useful tool for the follow-up of patients during or after treatment. The technological advances, notably in data collecting, but also in their integration and treatment with regard to artificial intelligence will allow integrating these evaluation tools in the management of patients in oncology.","106":"For several years, the profession of radiographer has been unattractive and is in search of professional recognition. Increasingly complex therapeutic and diagnostic evolutions forces professionals to develop their skills to ensure quality and safe care for all patients. The primary role of the radiographer is to support patients and to accompany them during their examination or treatment, combining caregiver and technician's roles. Transversal missions and delegation of tasks are inherent to the profession but are not widely recognized. Cooperation between radiotherapy professionals is a response to offer the therapeutic radiographer\/radiation therapist (RTT) opportunities in terms of attractiveness, career prospects, and increased skills. In radiotherapy, advanced practice activities already exist in some departments but require regulatory adjustments, in particular regarding the redistribution of the roles of RTT but also the status of these professionals. The formalization of these practices can be largely inspired by the many feedbacks around the world. This article aims to reflect the evolution's perspectives in the career of an RTT and on the valorisation of this profession in the current context.","107":null,"108":"Protontherapy for mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma reduces cardiac, lung and breast exposure, which may limit radiation-induced adverse events. While this technique is already widely implemented in the United-States, clinical experience is still limited in France. This study analyses the practice of mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma protontherapy at the Institut Curie to implement this technique at a larger scale. Data from all mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma patients from the hematology department of the Institut Curie who were subsequently evaluated at the Protontherapy Center of Orsay (CPO) of Institut Curie for adjuvant protontherapy were retrieved. We analyzed why these patients were ultimately treated with protontherapy or not. Between January 2018 and January 2021, twenty mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma patients from the hematology department of the Institut Curie have been screened for protontherapy at the CPO. Four of them (20%) were ultimately treated with proton beams. Treatment was well tolerated without grade 3-4 adverse events. With a median follow-up of two years, none of these patients relapsed. The others sixteen patients were not treated with protontherapy due to multiple reasons including: lack of treatment room disponibility, accessibility difficulties, psychiatric disorder, and anatomic or dosimetric considerations. Despite notable dosimetric superiority over photon radiotherapy and excellent clinical tolerance, lack of availability of protontherapy facilities limit implementation of mediastinal Hodgkin lymphoma protontherapy. Additionally, strict selection criteria must be defined. ","109":"The coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic has caused a global upheaval in our health care system. Our hospital facilities have been subjected to a major influx of patients and the prevention of cross-contamination has been a key issue in the spread of the virus. New recommendations for good hygiene practice and new recommendations for disease management have emerged to limit the spread of the virus and reorganize the provision of care in key services. Many studies have attempted to identify factors that contribute to poor prognosis for COVID-19 infection. Among them, cancer patients, were considered more at risk of developing severe forms of COVID-19. In this article, we provide an overview of the current state of the pandemic as well as new recommendations for disease management that have emerged in oncology and radiation therapy in particular. In this article, we will try to provide some answers through a review of the literature to the question: is cancer a prognostic factor for severe COVID-19?","110":"Cranial irradiation of primary or metastatic lesions is frequent, historically with 3D-conformal radiation therapy and now with stereotactic radiosurgery and intensity modulation. Evolution of radiotherapy technique is concomitant to systemic treatment evolution permitting long time survival. Thus, physicians have to face underestimated toxicities on long-survivor patients and unknown toxicities from combination of cranial radiotherapy to new therapeutics as targeted therapies and immunotherapies. This article proposes to develop these toxicities, without being exhaustive, to allow a better apprehension of cranial irradiation in current context.","111":null,"112":null,"113":"In the current spectrum of cancer treatments, despite high costs, a lack of robust evidence based on clinical outcomes or technical and radiobiological uncertainties, particle therapy and in particular proton therapy (PT) is rapidly growing. Despite proton therapy being more than fifty years old (first proposed by Wilson in 1946) and more than 220,000 patients having been treated with in 2020, many technological challenges remain and numerous new technical developments that must be integrated into existing systems. This article presents an overview of on-going technical developments and innovations that we felt were most important today, as well as those that have the potential to significantly shape the future of proton therapy. Indeed, efforts have been done continuously to improve the efficiency of a PT system, in terms of cost, technology and delivery technics, and a number of different developments pursued in the accelerator field will first be presented. Significant developments are also underway in terms of transport and spatial resolution achievable with pencil beam scanning, or conformation of the dose to the target: we will therefore discuss beam focusing and collimation issues which are important parameters for the development of these techniques, as well as proton arc therapy. State of the art and alternative approaches to adaptive PT and the future of adaptive PT will finally be reviewed. Through these overviews, we will finally see how advances in these different areas will allow the potential for robust dose shaping in proton therapy to be maximised, probably foreshadowing a future era of maturity for the PT technique.","114":"To evaluate the current and potential indications of photobiomodulation (PBM) and their level of evidence in the prevention or management of radiation therapy-related side effects. The Embase, Medline\/PubMed, Cochrane, EBSCO, Scopus, and LILACS databases were systematically reviewed to include and analyze publications of clinical studies that have assessed PBM in the prevention or management of radiotherapy-related side effects. The keywords used were \"photobiomodulation\"; \"low level laser therapy\"; \"acute oral mucositis\"; \"acute dysphagia\"; \"acute radiation dermatitis\"; \"lymphedema\"; \"xerostomia\"; \"hyposalivation\"; \"trismus\"; \"bone necrosis\"; \"osteoradionecrosis\"; and \"radiation induced fibrosis\". Prospective studies were included, whereas retrospective cohorts and non-original articles were excluded from the analysis. PBM in the red or infrared spectrum has demonstrated efficacy in randomized controlled trials in the prevention and management of radiotherapy-related side effects, especially acute oral mucositis, acute radiation dermatitis, and upper extremity lymphedema. The level of evidence associated with PBM was heterogeneous, but overall was still moderate. The main shortcomings were the diversity and lack of detail in treatment protocols, which could have compromised efficiency and reproducibility of PBM results. The published data suggest that PBM may be considered as a full-fledged supportive care for patients treated with radiotherapy, or at least in the setting of a therapeutic clinical trial. However, until strong evidence has been published on its long-term safety, the use of PBM should be considered with caution, specifically when applied near areas with proven or potential tumors. The patient should be informed of the theoretical benefits and risks of PBM in order to obtain his informed consent before treatment. ","115":"The standard of care for patients with locally advanced rectal cancer has recently changed and is now based on the concept of total neoadjuvant therapy with the association of radiotherapy and systemic chemotherapy before radical surgery. The addition of noeadjuvant systemic chemotherapy before or after radiotherapy during preoperative course significantly decreased the risk of distant metastases and prolonged disease-free survival after surgery. The risk of recurrence varies among patients and the standard management associating chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery may expose many patients to overtreatment and can negatively affect quality of life. In this setting, several ongoing trials evaluate the possibility of less aggressive individually tailored approach based on omission of one of three treatments. In particular, NORAD and PROSPECT trials evaluate whether irradiation could be safely omitted in patients who are good responders to induction chemotherapy and have locally advanced primarily resectable tumor with large predictive circumferential resection margin. In the other hand, the total neoadjuvant therapy had significantly improved the pathological complete response rate, up to 30%, leading the concept of non-operative management and organ-preserving strategies. The phase III GRECCAR 12 study has therefore evaluated the potential benefit of intensification of neoadjuvant chemotherapy whereas OPERA and MORPHEUS trials assessed radiotherapy dose escalation by contact X-ray or brachytherapy for organ-preserving strategies. To date, total neoadjuvant therapy following by radical surgery remains the standard of care but probably less aggressive approach with omission of radiotherapy or surgery will become a new standard in selected patients in next future.","116":"Conventional radiotherapy is a pivotal treatment in the management of bone metastasis. It is indicated primarily for palliative, analgesic, or decompressive purposes and in the prevention of severe bone events such as fractures and spinal cord compressions. It should be performed as early as possible from the onset of symptoms or within 14days following a surgical procedure of decompression or bone stabilization. Except in some cases, a pattern of 8Gy single dose is currently recommended, possibly renewable, by being vigilant on associated treatments which some, like antiangiogenics, must be imperatively suspended.","117":null,"118":"Since 2017, IRSN has been developing a new proactive risk analysis method. The Work Complexity Sharing and Exploration Spaces (EPECT in French) were tested for the first time in 2020 in the radiotherapy department of the Gustave Roussy Institute. The EPECT method makes it possible to anchor the analysis of risks incurred by patients in daily work situations and to involve the top management. The time required to involve the teams is comparable to or even less than that required for a conventional risk analysis. The cost\/benefit ratio of the method seems to be advantageous because it provides access to numerous information on daily activities, which makes it possible to improve the safety of patient care in radiotherapy. The information gathered allows relevant actions to be envisaged at both the technical and organizational levels, and to be linked to departmental projects.","119":"Paper patient file sharing has clearly been identified as a risk behavior for the COVID-19 virus transmission in radiotherapy units. In order to overcome this, the ONCORAD radiotherapy units worked on total dematerialization of the paper patient file, within 3 weeks. The methodology is based on a quality approch. This work has led to a convincing improvement in the management of risks a priori and a smoother patient care workflow.","120":"The quality of the initial management of sarcomas is fundamental because it conditions the patient's quality of life and his overall survival. Radiotherapy should be discussed in a multidisciplinary consultation meeting within the framework of the Netsarc+network. The place of radiotherapy in patients with soft tissue or bone sarcoma depends on the histology and tumour location, knowing that it is most often associated with surgery which remains the main treatment. It is part of the standard treatment for grade II and III deep limb sarcomas of 5cm or greater in size and Ewing's sarcomas. In these indications, conformal radiotherapy with modulation of intensity is used routinely, in combination with IGRT. In other locations, such as retroperitoneal sarcomas or uterine sarcomas, radiotherapy is not a standard of care and must be discussed according to the prognostic criteria related to the patient, the tumour, and the previously received treatments. New techniques, such as proton therapy, hadron therapy (carbon ions) are techniques particularly suited to bone sarcomas considered to be radioresistant. However, large prospective trials are lacking in these rare indications, explaining the lack of recommendations of a high level of evidence.","121":"At the Eugene Marquis Center, high dose rate brachytherapy is part of the care offering. The risk analysis and the national experience feedback linked to the use of high activity sources show that blocking the source outside its storage position, during treatment, would be the main risk of exposure of ionizing radiation. In a process of radiation protection of patients and workers, and to limit the consequences of such an accident, the Eugene Marquis Center has set up periodic training with practical experience for all brachytherapy professionals. This article describes the experience feedback from this training by brachytherapy technicians.","122":"Although three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) remains the gold standard as a curative treatment for NSCLC when surgery is not possible, intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is increasingly used routinely. The purpose of this study was to assess the clinical (immediate toxicities) and dosimetric impact of IMRT compared to 3D-CRT in the treatment of locally advanced (stages IIIA to IIIC) non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) treated with concomitant radiochemotherapy, while IMRT in lung cancer was implemented in the radiotherapy department of the Jean-Perrin Center. Between March 2015 and October 2019, 64 patients treated with concomitant radiochemotherapy were retrospectively included. Thirty-two received 3D-CRT and 32 IMRT. The radiotherapy prescription was 66Gy in 33 fractions of 2Gy. IMRT has improved coverage of target volumes (V95 increased by 14.81% in IMRT; P&lt;0.001) without increasing doses to OARs and reducing dysphagia (RR=0.67; P=0.027). Low doses to the lung were not significantly increased in IMRT (pulmonary V5 increased by 7.46% in IMRT). Intensity modulated radiotherapy, compared with the standard RC3D technique, improve the coverage of target volumes without increasing the dose to the OARs. It also improves the immediate tolerance of the treatment by reducing the number of dysphagia. ","123":"In radiotherapy, patient-specific quality assurance is very time-consuming and causes machine downtime. It consists of testing (using measurement with a phantom and detector) if a modulated plan is correctly delivered by a treatment unit. Artificial intelligence and in particular machine learning algorithms were mentioned in recent reports as promising solutions to reduce or eliminate the patient-specific quality assurance workload. Several teams successfully experienced a virtual patient-specific quality assurance by training a machine learning tool to predict the results. Training data are generally composed of previous treatment plans and associated patient-specific quality assurance results. However, other training data types were recently introduced such as actual positions and velocities of multileaf collimators, metrics of the plan's complexity, and gravity vectors. Different types of machine learning algorithms were investigated (Poisson regression algorithms, convolutional neural networks, support vector classifiers) with sometimes promising results. These tools are being used for treatment units' quality assurance as well, in particular to analyse the results of imaging devices. Most of these reports were feasibility studies. Using machine learning in clinical routines as a tool that could fully replace quality assurance tests conducted by physics teams has yet to be implemented.","124":"Endoscopic endonasal surgery (EES) is becoming a standard for most malignant sinonasal tumours. Margin analysis after piecemeal resection is complex and optimally relies on accurate histosurgical mapping. Postoperative radiotherapy may be adapted based on margin assessment mapping to reduce the dose to some sinonasal subvolumes. We assessed the use of histosurgical mapping by radiation oncologists (RO). A French practice survey was performed across 29 ENT expert RO (2 did not answer) regarding integration of information on EES, as well as quality of operative and pathology reportsto refine radiotherapy planning after EES. This was assessed through an electronic questionnaire. EES was ubiquitously performed in France. Operative and pathology reports yielded accurate description of EES samples according to 66.7% of interviewed RO. Accuracy of margin assessment was however insufficient according to more than 40.0% of RO. Additional margins\/biopsies of the operative bed were available in 55.2% (16\/29) of the centres. In the absence of additional margins, quality of resection after EES was considered as microscopically incomplete in 48.3% or dubious in 48.3% of RO. As performed, histosurgical mapping allowed radiotherapy dose and volumes adaptation according to 26.3% of RO only. Standardized histosurgical mapping with margin and additional margin analysis could be more systematic. Advantages of accurate EES reporting could be dose painting radiotherapy to further decrease morbidity in sinonasal tumours. ","125":"The management of high-risk prostate cancer has greatly evolved in recent years. Advances in imaging helps to better define the actual aggressiveness of the disease, to plan the surgical procedure, and to improve the prognostic evaluation of this high-risk of recurrence disease. The information obtained by MRI and by targeted biopsies improves management before surgery. Advances in nuclear medicine and generalization of PSMA-PET scans are beginning to improve the initial stage of diagnosis, thanks to a better detection of lymph node and distant metastases. The oncological interest of these new imaging techniques, which then influence the therapeutic plan, remains to be defined. The curative impact of an extensive lymph node dissection, as currently recommended, remains to be proved, and recently published randomized trials do not provide firm conclusions. The new hormone therapies pave the way for an intensification of perioperative systemic treatment, with a significant action on the tumor tissue, but an impact on survival, which remains to be defined in the context of ongoing randomized trials.","126":null,"127":"The oligometastatic disease concept suggests that patients with a limited number of metastases have a favorable prognosis. Radical local treatment of oligometastatic patients has then increased given developments in imaging (mainly positron emission tomography and brain magnetic resonance imaging) and access to effective and better tolerated treatments. Stereotactic radiotherapy has the advantage of being noninvasive, allowing a good rate of local control and a limited number of side effects. A better definition of oligometastatic disease, particularly for non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), has recently been published. For patients with NSCLC, two randomized phase II trials also suggested that the addition of a radical local treatment results in encouraging survival data, with a good safety profile. A single-arm phase II finally showed a benefit when combining a radical local treatment with an anti-PD1 immunotherapy. This review describes the definitions of oligometastatic disease, the main prospective findings including radiation therapy, and prospects for oligometastatic NSCLC patients.","128":"Considering intracranial tumours, only few indications of protontherapy, such as chordoma, chondrosarcoma or uveal melanoma, are uniformly approved in the world. Other indications, excluding paediatric pathologies, are still debated. The aim of this article is to describe the rationale for the use of protonbeam irradiation for meningioma, pituitary adenoma, craniopharyngioma, paraganglioma, glioma, and schwannoma, and to inform the radiation oncologists if prospective studies or randomized studies are opened for inclusions. This article deals only with indications for adults.","129":null,"130":"Modern radiotherapy treatment planning is a complex and time-consuming process that requires the skills of experienced users to obtain quality plans. Since the early 2000s, the automation of this planning process has become an important research topic in radiotherapy. Today, the first commercial automated treatment planning solutions are available and implemented in a growing number of clinical radiotherapy departments. It should be noted that these various commercial solutions are based on very different methods, implying a daily practice that varies from one center to another. It is likely that this change in planning practices is still in its infancy. Indeed, the rise of artificial intelligence methods, based in particular on deep learning, has recently revived research interest in this subject. The numerous articles currently being published announce a lasting and profound transformation of radiotherapy planning practices in the years to come. From this perspective, an evolution of initial training for clinical teams and the drafting of new quality assurance recommendations is desirable.","131":"Functional imaging allows the evaluation of numerous biological properties that could be considered at all steps of the therapeutic management of patients treated with brachytherapy. Indeed, it enables better initial staging of the disease, and some parameters may also be used as predictive biomarkers for treatment response, allowing better selection of patients eligible for brachytherapy. It may also improve the definition of target volumes with the aim of dose escalations by dose-painting. Finally, it could be useful during the follow-up to assess response to treatment. In this review, we report how functional imaging is integrated at the present time during the brachytherapy procedure, and what are its potential future contributions in the main tumour locations where brachytherapy is recommended. Functional imaging has great potential in the contact of brachytherapy, but still, several issues remain to be resolved before integrating it into clinical practice, especially as a biomarker or in dose painting strategies.","132":"Artificial Intelligence can be leveraged to analyze great amounts of data. It can be used on images or textual data to define the epidemiology of diseases, such as cancer. In this review, we will present and discuss the applications of AI in this setting.","133":"To focus on technical aspects of the implementation of interstitial high dose rate brachytherapy, with a step-by-step approach. Patients were selected during multidisciplinary tumor boards, according to inclusion criteria adapted from GEC-ESTRO guidelines. A CT scan was performed a few days before implantation. On pre-implant CT, using surgical scar and clips, surgical and pathological reports, and preoperative images, we delineated the tumor bed to be included in the Clinical Target Volume (CTV), according to GEC ESTRO Recommendations. A 3D virtual implant simulation of the best catheter positions was performed in order to cover the target volume. Implantation was then carried out under local anaesthetic using 3D projections of the catheter inlets and outlets. Dosimetry was performed on post-implantation CT scan. A dose of 34Gy was delivered in 10 fractions. Acute and late side effects, and local control were evaluated 2 and 8 months after treatment. Between July 2017 and January 2020, 20 patients were treated with accelerated partial breast irradiation. Dose constraints regarding target volume coverage, overdose, dose homogeneity, conformation index and organs at risk were met in 94.7%, 100%, 63.2%, 0% and 89.5% of the treatment plans, respectively. Grade 1-2 acute adverse events were observed in 21% of patients, with no grade 3-4 events. The first dosimetric results and early clinical tolerance and efficacy achieved by the implementation of breast interstitial multicatheter brachytherapy in routine clinical practice are very encouraging, and confirm the interest of extending this practice. ","134":null,"135":"Haemangioma is the most frequent benign hepatic tumour. Haemangioma is generally asymptomatic but it can sometimes cause disabling symptoms depending on its size and location. Surgery and interventional radiology are the cornerstone of the treatment in this situation. Radiation therapy, already used with good efficacy and safety to treat hepatic malignant lesions as hepatocarcinoma and metastases, is a relevant option in case of contraindication to surgery because of multiple or very large lesions. In this context, we report the case of a patient presenting with multiple symptomatic hepatic haemangiomas, successfully treated by radiation therapy in our department. These good results justified a review of the literature to report series of patients treated in this indication and to describe the main treatment regimens used.","136":"To use statistical process control for intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) quality assurance (QA) and improve tolerance limits and action limits. An electronic portal imaging device (EPID) was selected to verify IMRT QA. The I-chart and the exponentially weighted moving averages (EWMA) chart were used to analyze the corresponding results. Twenty samples were used to enable the sampling requirements for building the control limits to be met. The I-chart showed that isolated data points beyond the control limits were mainly derived from complex plans. The EWMA made predictions of systematic errors earlier than the I-chart. Systematic errors primarily originated from the dose calibration on the EPID, and recalibrating the EPID could eliminate such errors. Statistical process control is an effective tool to detect controllable and can be used in IMRT QA. After calibrating the EPID, the tolerance and action limits all improved and satisfied the requirements\/recommended values of the AAPM TG-218 report.

Seventy-nine consecutive patients treated with liposome-paclitaxel based concurrent chemoradiotherapy between January 2015 and December 2019 at Cancer hospital of the University of Chinese Academy of Sciences (Zhejiang cancer hospital) were enrolled in this study. The overall response, toxicities, progression-free survival and overall survival were analyzed with SPSS software. A total of 302 cycles of weekly chemotherapy were delivered, with a median 4 courses. After concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT), the efficacy was classified as CR in 4 cases (5.1%), PR in 22 cases (28.2%) and SD in 51 cases (65.4%). The median PFS and OS time were 18.2 months and 23.4 months. The 3-year PFS and OS rates were 45.1% and 43.6%, respectively. Liposome-paclitaxel and carboplatin concurrent with radiotherapy is a safe and effective modality for locally advanced ESCC. Further clinical investigation are warranted to evaluate the efficacy of this regimen. ","142":"Hypofractionated radiotherapy of early-stage squamous cell carcinoma of the glottic larynx is a promising treatment option. This can be divided into radiotherapy with moderate hypofractionation (up to 2.5Gy per fraction), more intense hypofractionation (between 2.5 and 4.5Gy per fraction) and stereotactic radiotherapy (above 4.5Gy per fraction). Most studies evaluating moderate hypofractionation show a local control rate between 85 and 95%. Acute laryngeal toxicity is superior to conventional treatment, but only for grades 1 and 2, with no significant difference reported for severe toxicity. Stereotactic radiotherapy in this pathology is also an emerging entity, but some authors have reported significant toxicity. There are currently no standardized guidelines for treatment and management regimen. We conducted a systemic review of published prospective and retrospective trials to evaluate efficacy, toxicity, and discuss future directions.","143":"The world has now been facing the coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) pandemic due to the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) since over a year. If most of clinical presentations are benign, fragile patients are at greater risk of developing severe or fatal lung disease. Many therapies have been explored with very low impact on mortality. In this context, Kirkby et Mackenzie have published in April 2020 a report reminding the anti-inflammatory properties of low-dose radiotherapy (delivering less than 1Gy) and its use in the treatment of viral and bacterial pneumopathies before antibiotics era. Large in vivo and in vitro data have demonstrated the biological rationale and anti-inflammatory activity of low-dose radiotherapy in many pathologies. Over the past year, three phase I\/II clinical trials have been published, as well as one randomized controlled trial, reporting the feasibility and the clinical and biological improvement of a 0.5 to 1Gy treatment dose to the entire lung. 13 other studies, including a randomized phase III trial, are currently ongoing worldwide. These studies may provide data in the effect of low-dose radiotherapy in the treatment of SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia. This article explains biological rationale of low-dose radiotherapy, and reports already published or ongoing studies on low-dose radiotherapy for SARS-CoV-2 pneumonia.","144":"Cranial radiotherapy (CRT) is used to treat a large variety of benign and malignant disorders. We present two cases of late neurological complications after CRT and briefly discuss its diagnosis and their shared pathophysiological aspects. The first case is a patient with cognitive impairment associated to mineralizing microangiopathy ten years after CRT for nasopharyngeal carcinoma and the second one is a woman with Stroke-like Migraine Attacks after Radiation Therapy (SMART) syndrome two years after CRT for anaplastic meningioma. Nowadays, higher survival rates might cause an increase in appearance of late neurological complications after CTR. These reported cases show that late complications can mimic a wide variety of neurological conditions and the importance of magnetic resonance image (MRI) to get a diagnosis.","145":"Penile metastasization is an uncommon condition, mostly derived from primitive advanced abdominal cancers, with disabling symptoms. Palliative treatment, in reason of poor prognosis patients, is frequently surgical with destructive management. We report two cases of penile metastasis, from primitive prostatic adenocarcinoma and primitive urothelial carcinoma, effectively managed with radiation treatment at our institution. A three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy with 42Gy to the planning target volume in 14 fractions was delivered. Radiation treatment was safely delivered, with low toxicity profile and achieved adequate symptoms control without compromising genitourinary functions. Radiation therapy should be considered in management of rare penile metastases.","146":null,"147":"The identification of the different risk factors for mandibular osteoradionecrosis (ORN) must be done before and after the management of patients with head and neck cancer. Various clinical criteria for this severe radiation-induced complication are related to the patient (intrinsic radiosensitivity, malnutrition associated with thin weight loss, active smoking intoxication, microcapillary involvement, precarious oral status, hyposalivation) and\/or related to the disease (oral cavity, large tumor size, tumor mandibular invasion). Therapeutic risk factors are also associated with a higher risk of ORN (primary tumor surgery, concomitant radio-chemotherapy, post-irradiation dental avulsion, preventive non-observance with the absence of stomatological follow-up and daily installation of gutters fluoride and, non-observance curative healing treatments). Finally, various dosimetric studies have specified the parameters in order to target the dose values distributed in the mandible, which increases the risk of ORN. An mean mandibular dose greater than 48-54Gy and high percentages of mandibular volume receiving 40 to 60Gy appear to be discriminating in the risk of developing an ORN.","148":null,"149":"The small bowel is a main dose-limiting organ in pelvic radiotherapy in the patients with rectal cancer. Conventionally, pelvic radiotherapy of patients with rectal cancer is performed in the prone position. Thirty-nine patients underwent CT planning scan in the treatment position (20 patients in prone position group and 19 patients in supine position group). After radiation treatment planning optimization, the volumes of the irradiated small intestines were investigated. The volume of irradiated small bowel was higher in the supine position (mean difference; 36,274 cm3). However, it was not statistically significant (P value=0.187) CONCLUSION: Supine position could be accepted for the patients undergoing preoperative rectal cancer chemo-radiation. ","150":"The tolerance of the concurrent use of radiotherapy, pertuzumab and trastuzumab is unknown. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the toxicity of this association in patients treated for HER2 positive metastatic and\/or locally recurrent unrespectable breast cancer. A retrospective study was performed in our institution for all consecutive patients treated with concurrent irradiation, pertuzumab and trastuzumab. The radiotherapy was performed while pertuzumab and trastuzumab were administrated as a maintenance treatment at the dose of 420mg (total dose) and 6mg\/kg respectively every 3 weeks without chemotherapy. Toxicity was assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0. Left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) was measured at baseline and then every 3-4 months. We studied 77 patients. treated in between 2013 and 2019 with median follow-up of 38 months (range 0-264 months). Median age was 53 years (33-86). There were 50 patients (64.9%) with metastatic and 27 patients (35.1%) with recurrent disease. All patients received docetaxel followed by P-T as first line treatment and they received 34 cycles (10-85) of pertuzumab and trastuzumab. All patients experienced partial or complete response according to RECIST criteria. Irradiation volumes were whole breast (41 patients, 53.2%) and chest wall (29 patients, 37.7%) at a dose of 50Gy with a median duration of 39 days. Radiotherapy of lymph nodes was performed in 53 patients (68.8%) as following: supraclavicular-infraclavicular and axillary lymph nodes in 52 patients (67.5%), and internal mammary nodes in 31 patients (40.3%). For 20 patients. (26.0%) radiotherapy was palliative: bone irradiation (12 patients, 15.6%), whole-brain radiotherapy (2 patients, 2.6%), cerebral metastasis irradiation (6 patients). As early toxicity we observed: radio dermatitis as following: 36 patients (46.8%) presented grade I, 17 patients (22.1%) presented grade II, and 3 patients (3.9%) presented grade III. One patient (1.3%) presented grade II esophagitis. One patient (1.3%) presented asymptomatic decrease of LVEF during treatment and 6 patients (7.7%) presented a decrease of LVEF. There was no radiation-induced pneumonitis. As late toxicity, we observed 1 (1.3%) case of grade I and 1 (1.3%) with grade II telangiectasia. There was 1 case (1.3%) of grade III cardiac toxicity, 8 months after the concurrent treatment. The concurrent use of radiotherapy, pertuzumab and trastuzumab is feasible with good tolerance. Larger prospective data with longer follow-up is needed to confirm these results. ","151":"Intensity modulated radiation therapy for head and neck is a complex technique. Inappropriate delineation and\/or dose distribution can lead to recurrences. Analysis of these recurrences should lead to improve clinical practice. For several years, different methods of analysis have been described. The purpose of this review is to describe these different methods and to discuss their advantages and limitations. The first published methods used a volume-based approach studying the entire volume of recurrence according to initial target volumes, or dose distribution. The main limitation of these methods was that the volume of recurrence studied was dependent on the delay in diagnosis of that recurrence. Subsequently, other methods used point-based approaches, conceptualizing recurrence either as a spherical expansion from a core of radioresistant cells (center of mass of recurrence volume) or using a more clinical approach, taking into account tumor expansion pathways. More recently, more precise combined methods have been described, combining the different approaches. The choice of method is decisive for conclusions on the origin of recurrence.","152":"Metastatic recurrence in an atypical site, such as the perineum, can occur after prostatectomy, cryotherapy, or brachytherapy, but is uncommon. To our knowledge, this is only the third case of perineal recurrence of prostatic cancer along a low dose rate brachytherapy needle track. A 64-year-old man was referred to an urologist with an increased PSA of 6.9ng\/mL in December 2008. There were no urinary symptoms. Prostatic biopsies revealed a Gleason 6 adenocarcinoma (3+3), and he was treated with low dose rate brachytherapy in May 2009. Sixty-seven seeds of iodine 125 were loaded under ultrasound control, and the PSA subsequently fell to a nadir of 1.19ng\/mL in November 2015. Eight years (May 2017) after the initial treatment, the PSA rose to 5.2ng\/mL. Pelvic MRI and choline PET revealed a nodule in the region of the left internal obturator muscle. Nodule biopsies confirmed prostatic origin. This perineal recurrence is thus most likely related to seeding of tumour cells along the track of a brachytherapy needle. To our knowledge, this is only the fourth case of perineal recurrence of prostatic cancer along a low-dose rate brachytherapy needle track. Perineal recurrence of prostatic cancer along a LDR brachytherapy needle track can occur. Improved imaging techniques may help to identify this type of recurrence earlier and optimise treatment.","153":null,"154":"Purpose of this review of medical literature is to present the immediate side effects of radiation therapy for head and neck cancer and their treatment. The likelihood and severity of these immediate side effects depends on a number of factors, including the total dose of radiation delivered, over what time it was delivered and what parts of the head and neck received radiation. Early side effects include: inflammation of the oropharyngeal mucosa (mucositis), painful swallowing (odynophagia), difficulty swallowing (dysphagia), hoarseness, lack of saliva (xerostomia), orofacial pain, laryngeal radionecrosis, dermatitis, hair loss, nausea, vomiting, inadequate nutrition and hydration, and weight loss. These complications can interfere with, and delay treatment. Most of these side effects generally dissipate over time. In conclusion, radiation treatment for the head and neck cancer causes significant early side effects. Many of these side effects present difficult challenges to the patients. Their recognition and treatment can significantly improve the patients' health, long-term survival and quality of life. The review provides information that can assist head and cancer survivors deal with radiation side effects.","155":null,"156":"Breast protontherapy efficiently limits cardiac, lung and contralateral breast exposure, which may clinically translate into better late tolerance profile compared with classic photon techniques. While breast protontherapy is already implemented in the United States and in some European countries, clinical experience of breast cancer protontherapy is currently limited in France. The aim of this study is to evaluate the clinical practice of breast cancer protontherapy at the Institut Curie in order to implement this technique at a larger scale. Data from all breast cancer patients that have been addressed to the protontherapy centre of Orsay (CPO, Institut Curie) for adjuvant breast protontherapy were retrieved. We analysed why these patients were ultimately treated with protontherapy or not. Between November 2019 and November 2020, eleven breast cancer patients have been evaluated for adjuvant protontherapy at the CPO. Two of them were ultimately treated with proton beams; adjuvant breast protontherapy therapy was well tolerated. The nine other patients were not treated with protontherapy due to lack of availability of protontherapy treatment rooms in acceptable time limits, at the time of patient evaluation. Despite dosimetric advantages and excellent clinical tolerance, lack of availability of protontherapy machines currently limits wider implementation of breast protontherapy.

IMRT plans for three representative lung cases who treated with 1.5T MR-Linac were generated using TPS Monaco 5.40.01. In each case, five types of plans were generated: (1) the \"original plan\" generated using 5-fields and beam angles manually optimized in ipsilateral tumor side, with no transverse magnetic field (TMF); (2) the plans generated by reoptimizing and recalculating the original plan, with a 1.5T TMF; (3) the plans generated with 5-fields, with beam angles manually optimized in anterior-posterior (AP) direction; (4) the plans generated with equidistant 5-fields; and (5) the plans generated with equidistant 9-fields. These plans were compared using a variety of dose-volume-parameters (DVPs). The DVPs under TMF showed the presence of 1.5T TMF can slightly change for all lung cases studied. When the plans generated with beam angles manually optimized in anterior-posterior direction, results showed that the plans improved conformity and homogeneity for PTV and reduced the dose to tissue surface. Furthermore, the results showed that the equidistant\/non-equidistant comparison of the previous target anatomy result in a more favourable dose distribution for the equidistant beam setting. At last, the results showed the dose distributions for PTV with 9 and 5 equidistant beams were not significantly different. The plan quality can be significantly changed by the presence of a 1.5T TMF for lung SBRT with MR-Linac. The selection of optimal fields number and beam angle can substantially reduce or even eliminate these changes, without deteriorating overall plan quality.

Recent reports suggest promise in use of SBRT as a tool in atrial and ventricular cardiac arrhythmias. The present systematic review deals with the use of SBRT technology for this novel indication. A PubMed search was done for articles published between 1990 and 2020. All original articles, case reports, case series of treated patients were included in the analyses. Out of the 55 articles in PubMed search, our search found 1 phase I\/II clinical case series, 3 clinical case reports, 3 animal studies and 4 dosimetric studies related to cardiac SBRT for arrythmias. All studies used a uniform cardiac dose of 25Gy. The available preclinical, dosimetric and clinical studies have suggested that SBRT for cardiac arrhythmias could become a potential alternative in suitable patients.

Fibrosarcoma, histiocytofibroma and angiosarcoma are the most common breast sarcoma. Angiosarcoma is the most common after breast cancer treated by radiation therapy, often diagnosed too late, with a severe prognosis and a high rate of recurrence. However, because of the low incidence of angiosarcoma associated with radiation therapy (AAR), the benefit of radiation therapy in breast cancer treatment outweighs the risk to develop angiosarcoma. The aim of this study is to evaluate these rare cases of AAR diagnosed in eastern Belgium in comparison to the data from the literature. Nine cases of AAR after radiation for breast ductal carcinoma were included in this retrospective study. AAR was diagnosed according to Cahan criteria between January 2007 and December 2016. Latency, incidence, management and prognosis are comparable to the literature. The median latency was 10 (4-24) years, the incidence of AAR in the East Belgian area was 0.09% of the patients irradiated on the same period. Patients were treated by surgery with wide local excision with or without reconstructive surgery, without radiotherapy and chemotherapy treatment. Kaplan-Meier analysis showed median overall survival of 61.8 months, patient survival of 55.6% at one year and 29.6% at five years. With the constant progress of medicine and its technologies, it would be possible to limit the occurrence of AAR or to diagnose it at an earlier stage.

In March 2020, 391 English citations on PubMed matched with search terms \"high risk prostate cancer boost\". Respectively 9 and 48 prospective and retrospective studies were on BT-boost and 7 retrospective studies were on SBRT-boost. Two SBRT-boost trials were prospective. Only one study (ASCENDE-RT) directly compared the gold standard treatment [dose-escalation (DE)-EBRT+androgen deprivation treatment (ADT)] versus EBRT+ADT+BT-boost. Biochemical control rates at 9 years were 83% in the experimental arm versus 63% in the standard arm. Cumulative incidence of late grade 3 urinary toxicity in the experimental arm and in the standard arm was respectively 18% and 5%. Two recent studies with HR-PCa (National Cancer Database) demonstrated better overall survival with BT-boost (low dose rate LDR or high dose rate HDR) compared with DE-EBRT. These recent findings demonstrate the superiority of EBRT+BT-boost+ADT versus DE-EBRT+ADT for HR-PCa. It seems that EBRT+BT-boost+ADT could now be considered as a gold standard treatment for HR-PCa. HDR or LDR are options. SBRT-boost represents an attractive alternative, but the absence of randomised trials does not allow us to conclude for HR-PCa. Prospective randomised international phase III trials or meta-analyses could improve the level of evidence of SBRT-boost for HR-PCa.","166":null,"167":null,"168":"A meta-analysis aimed to systematically evaluate the safety and efficiency of I125 irradiation stent placement for patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) combined with portal vein tumor thrombosis (PVTT). The Cochrane library, PubMed\/Medline, EMBASE, CNKI, Wanfang Data and CQVIP were systematically screened out from the earliest to December 2019. The qualities of all included studies were assessed. The primary endpoints were the 6-month, 12-month stent cumulative patency rate and 6-month, 12-month, 24-month overall survival rate while the secondary endpoints were the objective response rate of PVTT, main portal venous pressure changes and treatment-related adverse events. Our meta-analysis was conducted using Stata 12.0 software.

This study included 15 patients treated for prostate adenocarcinoma. Daily kilo voltage images and weekly CBCT scans were performed to assess prostate displacements and common and external iliac vessels motion. These data was used to calculate the CTV to PTV margins using Van Herk equation in the setting of a daily bone registration. We also compared the CTV to PTV margins of pelvic lymph nodes according to registration method; based on pelvic bone or prostate. We delineated bladder and rectum on all CBCT scans to assess their variations over treatment course at 4 anatomic levels [1.5cm above pubic bone (PB), superior edge, mid- and inferior edge of PB]. Using Van Herk equation, the prostate CTV to PTV margins (bone registration) were 8.03mm, 5.42mm and 8.73mm in AP, ML and SI direction with more than 97% of prostate displacements were less than 5mm. The CTV to PTV margins ranged from 3.12mm to 3.25mm for external iliac vessels and from 3.12mm to 4.18mm for common iliac vessels. Compared to registration based on prostate alignment, bone registration resulted in an important reduction of the CTV to PTV margins up to 54.3% for external iliac vessels and up to 39.6% for common iliac vessels. There was no significant variation of the mean bladder volume over the treatment course. There was a significant variation of the mean rectal volume before and after the third week of treatment. After the third week, the mean rectal volume seemed to be stable. The uni- and multivariate analysis identified the anterior wall of rectum as independent factor acting on prostate motion in AP direction at 2 levels (superior edge of, mid PB). The right rectal wall influenced the prostate motion in ML direction at inferior edge of PB. The bladder volume tends toward significance as factor acting on prostate motion in AP direction. We recommend CTV to PTV margins of 8mm, 6mm and 9mm in AP, ML and SI directions for prostate. And, we suggest 4mm and 5mm for external and common iliac vessels respectively.

The main evaluation data were the overall survival (OS) rate at 12 months and 24 months and the progression-free survival (PFS) rate at 6 and 12 months. The secondary evaluation data was the incidence of radionecrosis and adverse events. The study was performed using R \"meta\" package.

Different dose per fraction had no significant effect on both OS and PFS. Incidence of radionecrosis was 14.2%. Although the overall incidence of adverse reactions cannot be quantified, the toxicity of HFRT was acceptable. Compared with survival data for standard treatment, HFRT seemed to improve overall survival and progression-free survival, while high BED schedules may future increase benefit on PFS.

Prompt and accurate diagnosis of ISCM is necessary for effective treatment, and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is the preferred imaging technique. The optimal management of these patients is controversial because of the multitude of clinical circumstances and the lack of controlled studies on the efficacy of the different therapeutic approaches. Increased awareness of this rare entity may lead to an earlier diagnosis at a stage when neurological deficits are reversible, and therefore, more effective palliation may be achieved. Therefore, we carried out this retrospective research of 3 observations of ISCM, associated with a detailed review of the literature describing the diagnostic, therapeutic and evolutionary characteristics of this special rare entity.","177":null,"178":null,"179":"Stereotactic radiotherapy has become a standard in the management of patients with brain metastases; its main interest is to differ whole brain radiotherapy, provider of neurocognitive toxicity and to increase the rate of local control.

In the univariate analysis, clinical factors associated with complete tumor response were tumor mobility in digital rectal examination (P=0.047), a limited parietal invasion (P=0.001), clinically negative lymph node (P&lt;0.001) and a circumferential extent greater than 50% (P=0.001). On the other hand, a T4 classification and an endoscopic tumor size greater than 6cm were associated with no response to treatment (P=0.049 and P=0.017 respectively). On multivariate analysis, T2 clinical classification and N0 statement before treatment were independent predictive factors of pathologic complete response (P&lt;0.001 and P=0.001) and a delayed surgery after 12 weeks was associated with no response to treatment (P=0.001). The identification of predictive factors of histological response may help clinicians to predict the prognosis and to propose organ preservation for good responders. ","188":"The ultimate goal of stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) of brain metastases (BM) is to avoid or postpone whole brain radiotherapy (WBRT). A nomogram based on multi-institutional data was developed by Gorovets, et al. to estimate the 6 and 12-months WBRT-free survival (WFS). The aim of the current retrospective study was to validate the nomogram in a cohort of postoperative BM patients treated with adjuvant SRT. We reviewed the data of 68 patients treated between 2008-2017 with postoperative SRT for BM. The primary endpoint was the WFS. The receiver operating characteristic curve and area under the curve (AUC) were calculated for both 6- and 12-months time points. After a median follow-up of 64 months, the 1-year cumulative incidence of local and distant brain relapse rates were 15% [95% CI=8-26%] and 34% [95% CI=24-48%], respectively. At recurrence, repeated SRT or salvage WBRT were applied in 33% and 57% cases, respectively. The WFS rates at 6 and 12 months were 88% [95% CI=81-97%] and 67% [95% CI=56-81%], respectively. Using the Gorovets nomogram, the 6 months rates were overestimated while they were accurate at 12 months. AUC values were 0.47 and 0.62 for the 6- and 12-months respectively. Overall, Harrell's concordance index was 0.54. This nomogram-predicted well the 12 months WFS but its discriminative power was quite low. This underlines the limits of this kind of predictive tool and leads us to consider the use of big data analysis in the future.

High expression of OPN promotes aggressive behavior, causes poor prognosis in tumor cells, and reduces the survival of patients. Since overexpression of OPN gives rise to radioresistance, the effects of the gene knock out using the CRISPR\/Cas9 system in combination with radiation are emphasized. We used the CRISPR\/Cas9 technique to knock out the OPN gene in the MDA-MB-231 cell line. After transfection, the cells were irradiated. The changes of the OPN mRNA levels, the apoptosis, and the differences in cell viability were assessed. A significant reduction in the OPN expression was observed alone or along with irradiation. The knocked out gene alone increased apoptosis rate. The cell viability decreased to after knocking out of the OPN gene. The gene knocking-out combined with irradiation led to more decline of cell viability. Our results demonstrated that after knocking out the OPN gene, the MDA-MB-231 cells showed a significant radiosensitivity. Therefore, the OPN knock out in combination with conventional radiotherapy, may become an efficient therapeutic target in the future.

However, no consensus has been reached regarding the optimal synchronous chemotherapy regimen and the best combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of raltitrexed plus cisplatin and docetaxel plus cisplatin to find a safe and effective concurrent chemotherapy schedule. Our retrospective study included 151 EC patients treated with raltitrexed and cisplatin (RP) (n=90) or docetaxel and cisplatin (DP) (n=61) from 2011 till 2018. Survival outcomes and treatment related toxicity were analyzed between the two groups. PFS and OS were 18 and 34 months in the RP group, while 13 and 20 months in the DP group (P=0.118 and P=0.270). The 1-, 2-, 3-year survival rates of the RP group were 71.1, 55.4 and 46.4%. For the DP group, these were 63.9, 44.3 and 37.6%, respectively. Compared with DP group, RP group received a superior CR rate (68.9% versus 52.5%, P=0.041). There was a trend that the total number of toxic reactions in RP group was lower than that in DP group (P=0.058). Even RP and DP groups have the similar survival outcomes and toxicity, raltitrexed\/cisplatin get a higher complete response rate. Our study suggests that raltitrexed combined with cisplatin is a safe and effective concurrent chemotherapy regimen and it might be used as an alternative for cisplatin\/5-FU and cisplatin\/docetaxel in CCRT for EC patients.

Data of 205 patients with cervical cancer admitted to the hospital from June 2014 to August 2016 were retrospectively analyzed. These patients underwent concurrent radio-chemotherapy, followed by chemotherapy. The absolute numbers of peripheral blood lymphocytes and subtypes were compared before and after re-chemotherapy. For patients with a good prognosis, the number of lymphocytes, T cells, and cytotoxic T cells (Tc) significantly decreased (P&lt;0.05) after re-chemotherapy, while this phenomenon was not observed in patients with poor prognosis. Kaplan-Meier univariate analysis showed that patients with cervical cancer who had an advanced FIGO stage before treatment, presence of lymph node metastasis, and increased numbers of Tc and T helper cells after re-chemotherapy showed a low 30-month survival rate; the overall log-rank analysis showed significant differences (P&lt;0.05). Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression analysis, presence of lymph node metastasis: HR=9.718, P=0.002, 95% CI=0.183-0.679; Tc grouping: HR=3.239, P=0.0.072, 95% CI=0.950-03.347; Th group: HR=3.197, P=0.074, 95% CI=0.943-3.564. After radio-chemotherapy, in patients with advanced cervical cancer, the change in the numbers of peripheral blood Tc and Th before and after re-chemotherapy was associated with the 30-month overall survival rate of patients. It can be considered as a predictor of the survival of patients with advanced cervical cancer.

This study aimed to systematically review the brain microstructure changes using MRI-based measures, diffusion tensor imaging (DTI), diffusion kurtosis imaging (DKI) and voxel-based morphometry (VBM) and the impact of dose and latency following RT. PubMed and Scopus databases were searched based on PRISMA guideline to determine studies focusing on changes following NPC RT. Eleven studies fulfilled the inclusion criteria. Microstructural changes occur most consistently in the temporal region. The changes were correlated with latency in seven studies; fractional anisotropy (FA) and gray matter (GM) volume remained low even after a longer period following RT and areas beyond irradiation site with reduced FA and GM measures. For dosage, only one study showed correlation, thus requiring further investigations. DTI, DKI and VBM may be used as a surveillance tool in detecting brain microstructural changes of NPC patients which correlates to latency and brain areas following RT.

Large margins were historically applied around the CTV, increasing the dose delivered to organs at risk (OAR). With repositioning imaging and visualization of soft tissues during image guided RT, an opportunity to consider these movements and deformations appeared possible with an adaptive RT approach (ART). A bibliographic search on the PubMed database has been done in January 2019. Studies focusing on patients with MIBC, treating on ART, with the objectives of feasibility, clinical and\/or dosimetric evaluation and comparison with a standard irradiation technique were eligible. The purpose of this review was to define the different ART techniques used in clinical practice, to discuss their advantages compared to conventional RT in terms of target volume's coverage and OAR dose and to describe their feasibility in clinical practice. A total of 30 studies were selected. The strategies known as \"composite offline\", \"plan of the day\" not individualized or individualized, and \"re-optimization\" have been identified. All the studies have shown a significant benefit of ART in target coverage and dose of OAR, especially the rectum and small bowel. All ART plans produced are not used during RT sessions. Inter-observer variability for the selection of these plans can be observed. The practical implementation within a department required staff education and training, and increases the duration of treatment preparation. The \"A-POLO\" approach seems to be the most suitable for practice. ART is the technique of choice for bladder cancer RT. The \"plan of the day\" approach, individualized according to the A-POLO methodology, seems to be the most effective. The emergence of daily re-optimization, especially using MRI-Linac, is promising. The correlation between dosimetric benefits and clinical efficacy and safety results should be demonstrated into future trials.

The first part of the study consisted of an in vitro approach by irradiating the TIVAD with different electron and photon energies. The attenuation data measured were compared with data calculated by our treatment planning system. All patients treated by radiotherapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma with their TIVAD in the target volume were then reviewed to assess the clinical outcome and dosimetric comparison using different plan metrics. All patients were treated by 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy delivered by Helical Tomotherapy (HT). Nineteen patients treated for stage I-III HL were studied. Seven patients were treated exclusively on the side of TIVAD and 12 were treated bilaterally. Median prescription dose was 30Gy. No significant clinical or dosimetric differences were observed between the side of the TIVAD and the contralateral side in patients treated bilaterally. HT resulted in a significantly higher conformity index (P&lt;0.0022) and a significantly lower healthy tissue coverage (P=0.0008) than 3DCRT. The observed attenuation was 79% for 6 MeV, 59% for 9 MeV, and 46% for 12 MeV for electrons and 9% for 4 MV, 8% for 6 MV, 5% for 10 MV and 15 MV and 3% for 20 MV for X photons. TIVADs induce significant beam attenuation when using electrons, which can be overcome by using high-energy photons or by creating an exclusion zone in when HT is used.

The aim of this work is to describe the technique implementation, including treatment preparation, planning and dosimetric monitoring of TBI delivered in our institution from October 2016 to March 2019. Prior to patient care, irradiation protocol was set up using physical phantoms. Gafchromic films were used to assess dose distribution homogeneity and evaluate imprecise patient positioning impact. Sixteen patients' irradiations with a prescribed dose of 12Gy were delivered in 6 fractions of 2Gy over 3 days. Pre-treatment quality assurance (QA) was performed for the verification of dose distributions at selected positions. In addition, in-vivo dosimetry was carried out using optically stimulated luminescence dosimeters (OSLD). Planning evaluation, as well as results of pre-treatment verifications, are presented. In-vivo dosimetry showed the strong consistency of OSLD measured doses. OSLD mean relative dose differences between measurement and calculation were respectively +0,96% and -2% for armpit and hands locations, suggesting better reliability for armpit OSLD positioning. Repercussion of both longitudinal and transversal positioning inaccuracies on phantoms is depicted up to 2cm shifts.

Axillary recurrence in patients with invasive breast carcinoma remains an issue. Currently, the substitution of axillary lymph node dissection by sentinel node biopsy leads to revisit the role of axillary irradiation. Breast irradiation including level I, II and III might decrease the risk of axillary recurrence. A literature search was performed in PubMed and the Cochrane library to identify articles publishing data regarding dose-volume analysis of axillary levels in breast irradiation aiming to determine the potential therapeutic implications. Eleven articles were retained. A total of 375 treatment plans were analyzed. The results concerning the irradiation technique, initial dose prescribed to breast, delineated volumes and dose received at axillary levels were heterogeneous. The average dose delivered to axilla levels I-III with 3D-conformal radiotherapy using standard fields were between 24Gy and 43.5Gy, 3Gy and 32.5Gy and between 1.0Gy and 20.5Gy respectively. The average doses delivered to axilla levels I-III with 3D-conformal radiotherapy using high tangential fields were between 38Gy and 49.7Gy, 11Gy and 47.1Gy and 5Gy 38.7Gy, 32.1Gy and 5Gy (result available for only one study) respectively. Finally, the average doses delivered to axilla levels I-III with intensity modulated radiation therapy were between 14.5Gy and 42.6Gy, 3.4Gy and 35Gy and between 1.2Gy and 25.5Gy respectively.

A theoretical proposal of dosimetric approaches to prescribe dose in case of multiple contiguous BM is done. A literature review between 2010 and 2020 was performed on MEDLINE and Cochrane databases according to the PRISMA methodology, with the following keywords dose prescription, radiosurgery, multiple BM. Papers not reporting dosimetric solutions to irradiate multiple BM were excluded. Only one article in the literature reports a practical modality of dose prescription for multiple adjacent BM. Thus, we proposed other five practical solutions to prescribe radiation dose in case of two or more neighboring BM, describing advantages and drawbacks of each method in terms of different dosimetric parameters. The literature review about dosimetric solutions to irradiate multiple BM led to 56 titles; 14 articles met the chosen criteria and we reported their results in terms of dosimetric indexes and low doses to the normal brain tissue. The six dosimetric approaches here described can be used by physicians for multiple contiguous BM, depending on the clinical situation.

","205":"The aim of this study was to better understand the incidence and the clinical characteristics of cardiac radiation-induced sarcomas (RIS). We used the surveillance, epidemiology, and end results (SEER) program cancer registry data, the largest cancer database in the United States in order to identify all cardiac RIS between 1973 and 2015. We relied on the Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center (MSKCC)-modified 1948 Cahan criterions for RIS identification. Out of 8,136,951 cancer patients from the SEER database, we identified 448 patients diagnosed with cardiac sarcomas. Of these 448 cardiac sarcoma patients, two were considered to have developed a cardiac RIS: a metastatic rhabdomyosarcoma occurring after one to two years following lung carcinoma irradiation, and a soft tissue sarcoma (of unspecified type) developed six years after radiation therapy for an aggressive left-sided breast carcinoma. Based on this observation, we estimated that cardiac RIS represented about 0.4% (95% CI 0.1%-1.6%) of all cardiac sarcomas. A literature review has been conducted and yielded three additional cases of cardiac RIS. Cardiac RIS are extremely rare malignancies, associated with a very pejorative prognosis. The two reported histologies are angiosarcomas and rhabdomyosarcomas, which might be over-represented among cardiac RIS. A metastatic evolution is possible for cardiac radiation-induced rhabdomyosarcomas. Surgical excision, when feasible, is a therapeutic option and is the only specific treatment reported to this date.

Diagnosis of a bone lesion is therefore challenging to distinguish its nature in a patient suffering from both diseases. We report the case of a 69-years-old woman referred for P16 positive HPV-HNC. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) showed T2 hypo-signal on iliac crest and spine. 18FDG-PET demonstrated radiotracer uptake on these locations suggesting bone metastasis. However, bone biopsy showed epithelioid granuloma without malignant cells compatible with sarcoidosis location. The diagnosis of both localized advanced HPV-HNC and systemic sarcoidosis (bone, central nervous system) were retained. The patient received corticosteroid regimen at 0.5mg\/kg\/day and Methotrexate for sarcoidosis and radiation and chemotherapy with platins for carcinoma. As granulomatous bone marrow infiltration may have an uptake on 18FDG-PET, bone sarcoidosis can mimic metastatic disease. In addition, MRI often fails to distinguish sarcoidosis lesions from metastatic lesion in bones. As no reliable imaging test can decipher both diseases, the description of our case reinforces the necessity to perform bone biopsy in a patient suffering from both conditions to expertise the nature of bone lesions.","208":"Pelvic bone marrow is the site of nearly 50% of total hematopoiesis. Radiation therapy of pelvic lymph node areas, and cancers located near the bony structures of the pelvis, exposes to hematological toxicity in the range of 30 to 70%. This toxicity depends on many factors, including the presence or absence of concomitant chemotherapy and its type, the volume of irradiated bone, the received doses, or the initial hematopoietic reserve. Intensity modulated radiation therapy allows the optimisation of dose deposit on at risk organs while providing optimal coverage of target volumes. However, this suggests that dose constraints should be known precisely to limit the incidence of radiation side effects. This literature review focuses firstly on pelvic lymph node areas and bony volumes nearby, then on the effects of irradiation on bone marrow and the current dosimetric constraints resulting from it, and finally on hematological toxicities by carcinologic location and progress in reducing these toxicities.","209":"Radiation-induced myelopathy is a devastating late effect of radiotherapy. Fortunately, this late effect is exceptional. The clinical presentation of radiation myelopathy is aspecific, typically occurring between 6 to 24 months after radiotherapy, and radiation-induced myelopathy remains a diagnosis of exclusion. Magnetic resonance imaging is the most commonly used imaging tool. Radiation oncologists must be extremely cautious to the spinal cord dose, particularly in stereotactic radiotherapy and reirradiation. Conventionally, a maximum dose of 50Gy is tolerated in normofractionated radiotherapy (1.8 to 2Gy per fraction). Repeat radiotherapies lead to consider cumulative doses above this recommendation to offer individualized reirradiation. Several factors increase the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy, such as concomitant or neurotoxic chemotherapy. The development of predictive algorithms to prevent the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy is promising. However, radiotherapy prescription should be cautious, regarding to ALARA principle (as low as reasonably achievable). As the advent of immunotherapy has improved patient survival data and the concept of oligometastatic cancer is increasing in daily practice, stereotactic treatments and reirradiations will be increasingly frequent indications. Predict the risk of radiation-induced myelopathy is therefore a major issue in the following years, and remains a daily challenge for radiation oncologists.","210":"To explore the possibility of revising the spinal cord tolerance dose in Simultaneously Integrated Boost (SIB) intensity modulated treatment plan of locally advanced head and neck (H&amp;N) cancer and assessment of achieved planning gain due to the revision. In SIB regimen, the Organ at Risk (OARs) tolerance dose is equally distributed throughout the treatment. Clinicians have usually considered the spinal cord tolerance to be the same as in conventional technique. However, in SIB fractionation regimen with intensity modulation treatment, the spinal cord may receive a physical dose of 45Gy, with much lesser dose per fraction than 2Gy per fraction. So when the dose of spinal cord is distributed throughout the treatment, the tolerance dose limit of physical dose can be considered higher than the usual conventional dose limits. In this study, an attempt has been made to explore the possibilities of dose escalation and treatment planning benefits while exploiting this \"Window of Opportunity (WoO)\" of increase in spinal cord and Planning Risk Volume (PRV) spinal cord tolerance dose. A total of 12 patients CT data set along with approved structure set of H&amp;N cancer used for treatment planning in. Three independent SIB VMAT plans named as SPC, SPR and SPDE were generated for the 12 patients. First plan (SPC) was generated by considering standard spinal cord tissue constraint of maximum dose of 45Gy and PRV spinal cord maximum dose 50Gy as per QUANTEC summary and second plan (SPR) was generated considering spinal cord tissue constraint of maximum dose 52.50Gy and PRV spinal cord maximum dose 56.35Gy while optimization and dose calculation. The objectives for rest of the Organ at Risk (OAR) were kept same in both the plans during optimization and dose calculation. The SPC plan was copied for creation of third plan (SPDE) in which dose was escalated by increasing dose per fraction for target volumes such that dose to spinal cord reached a maximum dose of 52.50Gy and PRV spinal cord maximum dose of 56.35Gy. In this plan there have been changes to only dose per fraction, however dose optimization and dose calculation have not been performed. Radiobiological parameters TCP and NTCP were also calculated by using indigenously developed software. Considering the increase of spinal cord tolerance dose as \"window of opportunity\", a sufficient escalation in physical dose, Biological Effective Dose (BED) and Tumor Control Probability (TCP) was observed for all target volumes with acceptable level of NTCP values. Sufficient dose escalation and increased in TCP for target volumes or effective planning benefits can be achieved by revising the spinal cord tolerance dose in intensity modulated SIB treatment of locally advanced H&amp;N cancers.

This study aims to evaluate radiation exposure of cardiac substructures across a broad spectrum of breast cancer cases differing by cancer laterality, fractionation regimen and addition of deep-inspiration breath hold. Cardiac substructures were delineated following guidelines endorsed by the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO) for forty-four breast cancer patients having undergone conserving surgery and adjuvant rotational intensity-modulated radiation therapy. Target volumes consisted of the whole breast with a boost, axillary and internal mammary nodes. Patients were treated using free-breathing technique for left-sided or right-sided, normofractionated or hypofractionated helical tomotherapy or volumetric modulated arc therapy, or using deep-inspiration breath hold for left-sided normofractionated volumetric modulated arc therapy. Mean and maximum doses to cardiac substructures were retrieved. Correlations were performed between mean- and maximum radiation doses to cardiac substructures. Left-sided and right-sided irradiations were associated with different cardiac substructure exposure patterns despite comparable mean heart dose: 7.21Gy for left-sided normofractionated regimen, 6.28Gy for right-sided normofractionated regimen. Deep-inspiration breath hold reduced mean doses to almost all cardiac substructures for left-sided irradiation, but did not decrease maximum doses to coronary arteries. Correlations between mean- and maximum doses to cardiac substructures were usually moderate, but stronger for right-sided irradiation. Despite comparable mean heart dose, cardiac substructure radiation exposure patterns with rotational intensity-modulated radiation therapy strongly depend on the breast side, which could trigger clinically different long-term cardiotoxicity events. Deep-inspiration breath hold improves cardiac substructure dosimetry. Mean- and maximum heart dose could probably not be used as surrogate markers for precise cardiac substructure evaluation. In a near future, clinical practice and cardiotoxicity studies could possibly gain by considering cardiac substructure in a more systematic manner, possibly relying on cardiac autosegmentation algorithms.

The high dose PTV was divided into bone, air and tissue components and the comparison was performed for each of them. AXB Dw revealed no significant differences in the PTVs compared to AAA. Lower values were observed to spinal cord, brainstem, oral cavity and parotids (0.5% to 2.3%), and higher values to cochleas (up to 5.4%) and mandible (up to 6.7%). AXB Dm predicted lower values than AAA for all PTVs and OARs (2.0% to 6.1%). For the bone PTV subvolume, AXB Dw and Dm predicted respectively higher (2.4%) and lower (2.2% to 3.4%) values. No significant differences were noted in air. AXB predicted lower values than AAA in soft tissues (0.4% to 1.6%). The largest difference was found to the mandible V60Gy parameter, with median differences of 6.7% for AXB Dw and -6.0% for AXB Dm.

For unfavorable or favorable IR PCa treated by radiotherapy, the optimal strategy remains to be defined. In routine practice, the physician's decision to propose hormonal therapy (HT) is controversial. The PROACT survey aimed to evaluate pattern and preferences of daily practice in France in this IR population. A web questionnaire was distributed to French radiotherapy members of 91 centers of the Groupe d'Etude des Tumeurs Uro-Genitales (GETUG). The questionnaire included four sections concerning: (i) the specialists who prescribe treatments and multidisciplinary decisions (MTD) validation; (ii) the definition of IR subsets of patients; (iii) radiotherapy parameters; (iv) the pattern of practice regarding cardiovascular (CV) and (iv) metabolic evaluation.

The majority of centers consider PSA&gt;15 (77%) and\/or Gleason 7 (4+3) (87%) for an unfavorable IR definition. Overall, 41% of the centers performed systematically a CV evaluation before HT prescription while 61% consider only CV history\/status in defining the type of HT. LHRH agonists are more frequently prescribed in both favorable (70%) and unfavorable (98%) IR patients. Finally, weight (80%), metabolic profile (70%) and CV status (77%) of patients are considered for follow-up under HT. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first survey on HT practice in IR PCa. The PROACT survey indicates that three-quarters of the respondents identify subsets of IR-patients in tailoring therapy. The CV status of the patient is considered in guiding the HT decision, its duration and type of drug. ","218":"The primary objective of this work was to implement and evaluate a cardiac atlas-based autosegmentation technique based on the \"Workflow Box\" software (Mirada Medical, Oxford UK), in order to delineate cardiac substructures according to European Society of Therapeutic Radiation Oncology (ESTRO) guidelines; review and comparison with other cardiac atlas-based autosegmentation algorithms published to date. Of an atlas of data set from 20 breast cancer patients' CT scans with recontoured cardiac substructures creation according to the ESTRO guidelines. Performance evaluation on a validation data set consisting of 20 others CT scans acquired in the same treatment position: cardiac substructure were automatically contoured by the Mirada system, using the implemented cardiac atlas, and simultaneously manually contoured by a radiation oncologist. The Dice similarity coefficient was used to evaluate the concordance level between the manual and the automatic segmentations. Dice similarity coefficient value was 0.95 for the whole heart and 0.80 for the four cardiac chambers. Average Dice similarity coefficient value for the left ventricle walls was 0.50, ranging between 0.34 for the apical wall and 0.70 for the lateral wall. Compared to manual contours, autosegmented substructure volumes were significantly smaller, with the exception of the left ventricle. Coronary artery segmentation was unsuccessful. Performances were overall similar to other published cardiac atlas-based autosegmentation algorithms. The evaluated cardiac atlas-based autosegmentation technique, using the Mirada software, demonstrated acceptable performance for cardiac cavities delineation. However, algorithm improvement is still needed in order to develop efficient and trusted cardiac autosegmentation working tools for daily practice.

Pts with HNC treated by SCH-RT in two institutions were included retrospectively. The main SCH RT regimen was two courses of 30 grays (Gy)\/10 fractions separated by 2-4 weeks, without any systemic therapy. Between February 2012 and January 2019, 75 consecutive patients were analyzed. The median age was 80 years (range: 45.7-98.2) and 53 (70.7%) were men. Sixty-one (81.3%) pts had stage III\/IV disease and 54 (72%) had at least two comorbidities. All of them were treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 10.6 months (range: 3.1-58.3). Local control at 12 and 24 months was 72.8% IC95%[62-85.5] and 51.7% IC95%[38.1-70.1] respectively. Progression free survival (PFS) at 12 and 24 months were 47.7% IC95%[37.4-60.8] and 41% IC95%[15-36.4] respectively, with a median of 11.5 months IC95%[8.9-17].

Acute and late grade 3 or higher toxicities occurred for 6 (8%) and 3 (4%) pts. The present SCH-RT regimen seems effective, well-tolerated and could represent an alternative to palliative strategies for pts deemed unfit for standard exclusive RT. ","220":"Flaps are increasingly used during reconstructive surgery of head and neck cancers to improve functional outcomes. There are no guidelines as to whether the whole flap or its anastomotic border should be included in the primary tumour target volume of postoperative radiotherapy to prevent local relapses. Relapse and toxicity rates can increase substantially if the whole flap received full dose. Our aim was to determine whether flaps were included in the primary tumour target volume and to report the patterns of relapse and toxicity. Consecutive patients in 2014 through 2016, with or without a flap, receiving postoperative radiotherapy were selected in a retrospective monocentric control study. Flaps were homogenously delineated blind to treating radiation oncologists using a flap-specific atlas. Tumour recurrence, acute and late toxicity were evaluated using univariate and propensity score analyses. A hundred patients were included; 54 with a flap. Median flap volume included in the tumour volume was 80.9%. Twelve patients experienced local recurrences: six with a flap, among whom two within their flap (3.7%). Patients with flaps had larger median tumour volumes to be irradiated (25cm3 versus 58cm3, p&lt;0.001) and higher acute\/late toxicity rates (p&lt;0.001) even after adjustment on biases (more advanced T stage, oral cavity, active smoking in patients with flaps). Locoregional recurrence and survival rates were similar between patients with\/without a flap. Recurrences within a flap were rare in this series when including the whole flap body in the 60Gy-clinical target volume but inclusion of the flap in the primary tumour target volume increased toxicity. Multicentric studies are warranted.

In our department, during the daily delineation, radiation oncologists specialized in breast cancer treatment sought consensus on the delineation of clinical treatment volume of the breast through dialogue based on cases. A radiation oncologist delineated clinical treatment volumes on CT scans of five to 20 patients, followed by a discussion and adaptation of the delineation between all radiation oncologists of the team. The consensus established between clinicians was discussed, corrected and improved. All patients were delineated in treatment position; skin markers were used to visualize the breast tissue after careful palpation. Breast clinical treatment volume was situated and delineated between pectoral muscle and 5mm below the skin (dosimetric considerations), within the space outlined by skin markers, that showed the limits of the palpable breast tissue. In lateral position some vessels were very useful to define the limits as rami mammarii (from thoracica interna) for the internal one and thoracica lateralis for the external. This is the first atlas proposed for the delineation of the breast clinical treatment volumes for breast cancer using alternative technique of breast irradiation (lateral). This atlas will be helpful for the volume definition in our daily practice of breast irradiation in lateral position and can open perspectives to develop also atlases for other alternative techniques as treatment in prone position. ","226":"Immediate breast reconstruction versus delayed breast reconstruction improves quality of life of breast cancer patients undergoing total mastectomy without impacting oncologic outcomes. Two types of immediate reconstruction are possible, implant-based reconstruction or autologous reconstruction. These reconstructions interpose a tissue in the operating bed, which modifies target volume definition compared to a wall without reconstruction Post mastectomy radiotherapy increases the rate of postoperative complications for both surgical procedures. Recent guidelines were published about target volume definition in the post mastectomy setting after implant-based reconstruction. Guidelines about target volume definition after autologous reconstruction are still awaited. The aim of our work is to present the different surgical procedures for immediate breast reconstruction, their complications, and the definition of the postmastectomy target volume.","227":"Health data financed by the French national solidarity system constitute a common heritage. Such data should be exploited to optimize care while complying with ethics and fundamental rights of citizens. The creation of the Health Data Hub (HDH) was allowed by the 24 July 2019 Law on the organization and transformation of the French health system. Its objective is to enable authorized innovative project leaders to access non-nominative data via a state-of-the-art secure technological platform. It appears to be one of the strong points of the French Artificial Intelligence strategy. This structure is a public interest group which associates 56 stakeholders, mostly from the public authorities. It implements, in partnership with the National Health Insurance Fund, the major strategic orientations relating to the National Health Data System set by the French State and the Ministry of Solidarity and Health. The Health Data Hub allows cross-reference of consolidated databases with SNDS data. Several use cases are under construction. The creation of relational databases in radiation oncology is also possible through specific strategies to get pseudonymized data from the various radiotherapy software programs upstream of the Health Data Hub.","228":"Advances in physical, technological and biological fields have made radiation oncology a discipline in continual evolution. New current research areas could be implemented in the clinic in the near future. In this review in the form of several interviews, various promising themes for our specialty are described such as the gut microbiota, tumor organoids (or avatar), artificial intelligence, connected therapies, nanotechnologies and plasma laser. The individual prediction of the best therapeutic index combined with the integration of new technologies will ideally allow highly personalized treatment of patients receiving radiation therapy.","229":null,"230":"Multimodal imaging has become a standard for planning radiation therapy via magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or positron emission tomography (PET) in many cancers. However, its use is now old, and its impact has not been much discussed in light of technological improvements in imaging and advances in radiotherapy. However, in 20 years, the exclusive functional imaging has been replaced by hybrid imaging (functional and anatomical) with successive improvements (flight time, detector modifications, digitisation, etc.) have enabled us to go from centimetric resolution to the current 3 to 4mm resolution. This article will specifically review PET technology, its latest advances and the potential impact on radiotherapy, particularly head and neck cancers.","231":"Continuous improvements have been made in the way to prescribe, record and report dose distributions since the therapeutic use of ionizing radiations. The international commission for radiation units and measurement (ICRU) has provided a common language for physicians and physicists to plan and evaluate their treatments. The PTV concept has been used for more than two decades but is becoming obsolete as the CTV-to-PTV margin creates a static dose cloud that does not properly recapitulate all planning vs. delivery uncertainties. The robust optimization concept has recently emerged to overcome the limitations of the PTV concept. This concept is integrated in the inverse planning process and minimizes deviations to planned dose distribution through integration of uncertainties in the planning objectives. It appears critical to account for the uncertainties that are specific to protons and should be accounted for to better exploit the clinical potential of proton therapy. It may also improve treatment quality particularly in hypofractionated photon plans of mobile tumors and more widely to photon radiotherapy. However, in contrast to the PTV concept, a posteriori evaluation of plan quality, called robust evaluation, using error-based scenarios is still warranted. Robust optimization metrics are warranted. These metrics are necessary to compare PTV-based photon and robustly optimized proton plans in general and in model-based NTCP approaches. Assessment of computational demand and approximations of robust optimization algorithms along with metrics to evaluate plan quality are needed but a step further to better prescribe radiotherapy may has been achieved.","232":null,"233":"Radiomics is a field that has been growing rapidly for the past ten years in medical imaging and more particularly in oncology where the primary objective is to contribute to personalised and predictive medicine. This short review aimed at providing some insights regarding the potential value of radiomics for cancer patients treated with radiotherapy. Radiomics may contribute to each stage of the patients' management: diagnosis, planning, treatment monitoring and post-treatment follow-up (toxicity and response). However, its applicability in clinical routine is currently hindered by several factors, including lack of automation, standardisation and harmonisation. A major effort must be carried out to automate the workflow, standardise radiomics good practices and carry out large-scale studies before any transfer to daily clinical practice.","234":null,"235":"Adaptive radiotherapy (ART) corresponds to various replanning strategies aiming to correct for anatomical variations occurring during the course of radiotherapy. The goal of the article was to report the rational, feasibility and benefit of using PET and\/or MRI to guide this ART strategy in various tumor localizations. The anatomical modifications defined by scanner taking into account tumour mobility and volume variation are not always sufficient to optimise treatment. The contribution of functional imaging by PET or the precision of soft tissue by MRI makes it possible to consider optimized ART. Today, the most important data for both PET and MRI are for lung, head and neck, cervical and prostate cancers. PET and MRI guided ART appears feasible and safe, however in a very limited clinical experience. Phase I\/II studies should be therefore performed, before proposing cost-effectiveness comparisons in randomized trials and before using the approach in routine practice.","236":"Radiation therapy (RT) is one of the main modalities of cancer treatment worldwide with computed tomography (CT), as the most commonly used imaging method for treatment planning system (TPS). Image reconstruction errors may greatly affect all the radiation therapy planning process, such as target delineation, dose calculation and delivery, particularly with particle therapy. Metallic implants, such as hip and spinal implants, and dental filling significantly deteriorate image quality. These hardware structures are often very complex in geometry leading to geometric complex artefacts in the clinical target volume (CTV) area, rendering the delineation of CTV challenging. In our review, we focus on the methods to overcome artefact consequences on CTV delineation: 1- medical approaches anticipating issues associated with imaging artefacts during preoperative multidisciplinary discussions while following standard recommendations; 2- common metal artefact reduction (MAR) methods such as manually override artefact regions, ballistics avoiding beam paths through implanted materials, megavoltage-CT (MVCT); 3- prospects with radiolucent implants, MAR algorithms and various methods of dual energy computed tomography (DECT). Despite substantial and broad evidence for their benefits, there is still no universal solution for cases involving implanted metallic devices. There is still a high need for research efforts to adapt technologies to our issue: \"how do I accurately delineate the ideal CTV in a metal artefact area?\"","237":"The management of early metastatic prostate cancer is based on systemic treatment by androgen deprivation therapy with or without chemotherapy or next-generation anti-androgen therapies. Local treatment of the prostate was initially used only to alleviate local symptoms. However, local radiotherapy of the prostate has been the subject of retrospective and prospective studies in patients with better prognostic factors, particularly in oligometastatic status. The results of these studies support that prostate radiotherapy can prolong the survival of patients with a low metastatic burden. This article states the biological bases, the main published and future published studies aimed to embed this strategy to optimize therapeutic management.","238":"Mechanisms of late radio-induced lesions are the result of multiple and complex phenomena, with many entangled cellular and tissue factors. The biological continuum between acute and late radio-induced effects will be described, with firstly a break in homeostasis that leads to cellular redistributions. New insights into late toxicity will finally be addressed. Individual radiosensitivity is a primary factor for the development of late toxicity, and clinicians urgently need predictive tests to offer truly personalized radiation therapy. An update will be made on the various functional and genetic tests currently being validated. The management of radio-induced side effects remains a frequent issue for radiation oncologists, and an update will be made for certain specific clinical situations. Finally, an innovative management for patients with significant side effects after pelvic radiotherapy will be developed, involved mesenchymal stem cell transplantation, with the presentation of the \"PRISME\" protocol currently open to patients recruitment.","239":null,"240":"This article aims to describe and list the clinical trials that have changed our practices in breast cancer, urological cancer, gynecological cancer, cancer of the upper aerodigestive tract and digestive cancer in the last ten years. We listed and selected the studies published between 2010 and 2020. The articles were identified on the basis of a Medline search with PubMed and knowledge of the authors. Five to six trials were selected in breast cancer, urological cancers, gynecological cancers, cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract and digestive cancers asking the different fundamental questions in radiotherapy. Depending on the pathologies, the questions raised over the past 10 years remain fundamental questions such as the place of neoadjuvant treatment, the place of hypofractionation or the type of chemotherapy concomitant with radiotherapy. ","241":"External radiotherapy process is a chain of steps in which each of them is carried out only if the previous one has been completed. The development of hypofractionation practices in recent years tends to increase the workload of the stages of preparation for irradiation and to decrease the number of fractions per patient. The purpose of this retrospective study is to analyze the evolution of these practices in a single centre and to assess the organizational issues involved. All radiation therapy records management data were extracted from the Radiation Therapy Information System. Radiotherapy sessions were identified by patient and by ICD (International Classification of Diseases) code. The filling rate of the treatment equipment was calculated using actual data from the radiotherapy department. From 2015 to 2019, there was an increase in the number of scans (+16%), the number of patients treated (+11.6%) and the volume of hours available for treatment (+12%). Also, there was a decrease in the total number of fractions (-5%), in the average number of fractions performed per treatment sequence (-19%), in the occupancy rate of the machines (-7%) and in the average number of fractions performed per patient treated for malignant tumours of the bronchi and lung (-38%), digestive organs (-37%), secondary (-19%) breast (-15%) and prostate (-15%). The number of fractions administered per treatment sequence between 2015 and 2019 decreased significantly for patients in age groups [20-69] (P&lt;0.001) and [&gt;70] (P&lt;0.001). A paradox appears between the increase in the total number of patients treated and the decrease in the loading rate of linacs. This shift of workload has an impact on the quality and safety of care and on the organizational and investment strategies. It also has an economic impact where the model of reimbursement is based on per fraction pricing. A reorganization of radiotherapy services is inevitable. ","242":"Stereotactic radiotherapy is a fundamental change from the conventional fractionated radiotherapy and represents a new therapeutic indication. Stereotactic radiotherapy is now a standard of care for inoperable patients or patients who refuse surgery. The results are encouraging with local control and survival rates very high in selected populations. The rate of late toxicity remains acceptable. Good tolerability makes it appropriate even for elderly and frail patients. In these fragile patients or in certain specific clinical situations, different surgical, radiotherapy or interventional radiology attitudes can be discussed on a case-by-case basis. These situations are considered in this article for the pulmonary, hepatic and prostatic localizations.","243":"Cancer and cardiovascular disease (CVD) are the leading cause of mortality worldwide, and breast cancer (BC) the most common malignancy affecting women worldwide. Radiotherapy is an important component of BC treatment and participates in CVD occurrence. It seems, therefore, crucial to gather both radiation oncology and cardiology medical fields to improve the follow-up quality of our BC patients. This review aims at updating our knowledge regarding cardiotoxicities risk factors, and consequently, doses constraints in case of 3D-conformal and IMRT treatment planning. Then we will develop how to reduce cardiac exposure and what kind of cardiac follow-up we could recommend to our breast cancer patients.","244":"The planning target volume is an essential notion in radiotherapy, that requires a new conceptualization. Indeed, the variability and diversity of the uncertainties involved or improved with the development of the new modern technologies and devices in radiotherapy suggest that random and systematic errors cannot be currently generalized. This article attempts to discuss these various uncertainties and tries to demonstrate that a redefinition of the concept of planning target volume toward its personalization for each patient and the robustness notion are likely an improvement basis to take into account the radiotherapy uncertainties.","245":"The challenge of the management of brain metastases has not finished yet. Although new diagnosis-specific prognostic assessment classifications and guidelines for patients with brain metastases help to guide treatment more appropriately, and even if the development of modern technologies in imaging and radiation treatment, as well as improved new systemic therapies, allow to reduce cognitive side effects and make retreatment or multiple and combined treatment possible, several questions remain unanswered. However, tailoring the treatment to the patient and his expectations is still essential; in other words, patients with a poor prognosis should not be over-treated, and those with a favorable prognosis may not be subtracted to the best treatment option. Some ongoing trials with appropriate endpoints could better inform our choices. Finally, a case-by-case inter-disciplinary discussion remains essential.","246":"Seeking a second medical advice as a medical practitioner is a frequent situation that should be facilitated to best suit patients' expectations, while maintaining medical confidentiality. The patient and his relatives need to be involved with diagnostic and therapeutic procedures. The radiation oncologist should accept and help a patient who seeks a second advice, and patients will always appreciate when the physician helps them to seek such an advice. Examples that each practitioner should know include tertiary centers tumor boards, centers with access to innovation or clinical research, or with special teams to take care of specific populations such as adolescents and young adults. In some situations, no treatment can also be the best treatment, and it takes time to explain and discuss such watchful waiting strategies to patients. In case of recurrent disease after radiotherapy, salvage reirradiation must be discussed at a tertiary tumor board and weighed against other options, especially for rare and complex cases. Radiation oncology has gained multiple options with technological advances, such as proton therapy, brachytherapy, stereotactic body radiotherapy with respiratory tracking or contact therapy. Radiation oncologists must know the benefits associated with each option in terms of survival, local control or organ preservation in order to address patients to the best practitioner.","247":"Metastases are the most common brain tumors. After surgery, stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) of the resection cavity is the standard of care. Data from two randomized trials indicate that SRT to the surgical bed is an effective treatment in reducing local failure as compared with observation, while reducing the risk of cognitive deterioration and maintaining quality of life as compared with whole brain radiation therapy. Local control appears higher after hypofractionated SRT compared to single-fraction SRT. Several questions such as target volumes, the optimal regimen in particular for large tumor bed, strategies to reduce the risk of lepto-meningeal recurrence, and the treatment sequence still need to be answered.","248":null,"249":"For many years, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy remained essential in the therapeutic management of gastric and pancreatic adenocarcinomas. For these tumours, surgical excision, the only hope of offering the patient prolonged survival, is only possible in 20% of cases. The median survival of operated patients is only 12 to 20 months due to the frequency of locoregional and\/or metastatic recurrences. For stomach cancers, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy is justified by the results of the phase III trial Intergroup 0116 published by MacDonald et al. The gain in survival was at the cost of significant toxicity. This treatment was supplanted in the early 2000s by perioperative chemotherapy. Currently, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy clinical studies are ongoing with the aim of improving treatments observance and tolerance. For pancreatic cancers, the role of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy has long been discussed because of trials with contradictory results. Neoadjuvant radiotherapy has many advantages in terms of efficacy and tolerance. It increases the chances of subsequent complete tumour resection. Several prospective trials are currently ongoing to clarify its place in the therapeutic arsenal.","250":"Synchronous metastatic breast cancer accounts for 5 to 6% of all breast cancers in Western countries, which corresponds to nearly 2500 new cases per year in France. Irradiation of the primary tumour in cases of metastatic disease at diagnosis was historically reserved for palliative indications. However, progress in systemic treatments, a better understanding of the biological basis of metastatic dissemination, the genesis of the concept of oligometastatic disease and ablative treatments directed towards metastases are revolutionizing the management of patients with de novo stage IV breast cancer. Survival of these patients has improved markedly over the years, and several studies have investigated the carcinological benefit of local treatment of the breast tumour in patients with advanced diseases at diagnosis. This article provides an update on the role of irradiation of the primary tumour in breast cancer with synchronous metastases, and discusses its interest through published or ongoing trials.","251":"Over the last few years, the radiation therapist profession has undergone major developments. In radiotherapy, the teams, and their organization as well as the techniques have changed, however always with the goal of improving treatment quality for patients. Throughout interviews, this article offers to show three missions that have been assigned to French radiation therapists, such as the initial consultation, the role of the radiation therapist with the linear accelerator with onboard MRI, and paramedical research. The contribution of new technologies, the modification of the types of participants on the patient journey, as well as the thought process about the use of evidence-based practice and radiation therapist research have initiated changes for the job description, the beginning of more advanced practices, and a perspective of evolution within this profession.","252":"Sarcomas are rare tumours arising from mesenchymal tissue. A multimodal management in an expert centre combining surgery and radiotherapy is the current standard of care for localized soft-tissue sarcomas of the extremities, to enable limb-sparing strategies. The delivery of pre- radiotherapy or postoperative radiotherapy offers similar local control and survival rates but the toxicity profile is quite different: preoperative radiotherapy increases the risk of wound complications and postoperative radiotherapy affects long-term functional outcomes. While postoperative radiotherapy has long been the rule, especially in Europe, technical improvements with image-guided- and intensity-modulated radiotherapy associated with a better management of postoperative wounds has tended to change practices with more frequent preoperative radiotherapy. More recently the possibilities of a hypofractionated regimen or potentiation by nanoparticles to increase the therapeutic index plead in favour of a preoperative delivery of radiotherapy. The aim of this paper is to report pros and cons of pre- and post-operative radiotherapy for soft-tissue sarcomas.","253":null,"254":null,"255":null,"256":"Advances in the reconstructive surgery and minimally invasive endonasal endoscopic surgery of head and neck is poorly evaluated in terms of their impact on radiotherapy planning and outcomes. These surgical advances have resulted in reduced morbidity with equivalent or better tumor control. In the absence of a recommendation on how to delineate target volumes in patients with flaps or to consider margins after endoscopic endonasal surgery, radiotherapy practices are inevitably heterogeneous. Efforts are needed to increase the therapeutic index of postoperative radiotherapy in these situations. We analysed the rare existing literature and outlined a preliminary basis for a recommendation. Strengthening of multidisciplinarity to accurately define target volumes in these complex and relatively new situations, and \"delineation concertation meetings\" between radiologists, surgeons and radiation oncologists could probably contribute to improved outcomes.","257":null,"258":"Brain metastases are the most common intracranial tumors and are associated with a dismal prognosis. The management of patients with brain metastases has become more important because of the increased incidence of these tumours, the better treatment of the systemic disease and the improvement of surgical techniques. The treatment requires multidisciplinary approaches and become complex because of new emerging systemic therapy and advancements in neurosurgery and radiation oncology. The surgical treatment has an indispensable role to obtain a tissue diagnosis, in relieving intracranial effect mass and improving neurological status by improving induced encephalopathy. An understanding of the role and indications of the surgery in patients with metastatic brain lesions is essential for the effective management of this growing population.","259":"From surviving fraction to tumour curability, definitions of tumour radioresistance may vary depending on the view angle. Yet, mechanisms of radioresistance have been identified and involve tumour-specific oncogenic signalling pathways, tumour metabolism and proliferation, tumour microenvironment\/hypoxia, genomics. Correlations between tumour biology (histology) and imaging allow theragnostic approaches that use non-invasive biological imaging using tracer functionalization of tumour pathway biomarkers, imaging of hypoxia, etc. Modelling dose prescription function based on their tumour radio-resistant factor enhancement ratio, related to metabolism, proliferation, hypoxia is an area of investigation. Yet, the delivery of dose painting by numbers\/voxel-based radiotherapy with low lineal energy transfer particles may be limited by the degree of modulation complexity needed to achieve the doses needed to counteract radioresistance. Higher lineal energy transfer particles or combinations of different particles, or combinations with drugs and devices such as done with radioenhancing nanoparticles may be promising.","260":"Patients with synchronous metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas often present associated locoregional symptoms and a risk of life-threatening primary tumour progression. Few data have been published about the use of radiation therapy in the management of newly diagnosed metastatic disease associated with advanced locoregional disease. In this article, we aim to determine the role of radiation therapy of the primary tumour in the overall therapeutic strategy for these diseases. We further address radiation therapy modalities (technique, volumes, and fractionation) in such a context. We conducted a literature survey on locoregional radiotherapy for newly diagnosed metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. Several retrospective studies have reported that locoregional radiotherapy is associated with improved overall survival of patients with synchronous metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas. However, data about modalities such as timing of radiotherapy in the overall strategy, dose, fractionation and delineation volumes are scarce. Two schematic situations can be distinguished with respect to prognosis and treatment adaptations: polymetastatic\/bulky or oligometastatic disease. In polymetastic\/bulky disease associated with poor prognosis, standard-of-care is systemic therapy, but locoregional radiotherapy can be discussed either upfront, mainly for symptomatic palliation, or as consolidation after downsizing obtained by systemic therapy. As for oligometastatic disease, with the rise in use of efficacious and well-tolerated local ablative treatments of metastases, aggressive curative-intent locoregional radiotherapy can be considered with or without systemic therapy. Because locoregional disease is a major cause of disease failure in patients with synchronous metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas, aggressive locoregional radiation therapy to the primary tumour may be discussed in the initial management of the disease where systemic therapy alone may not induce sufficient primary tumour reduction. With recent technological advances in radiotherapy, the delivery of radiotherapy is safe and feasible even in metastatic setting. Clinical trials assessing radiotherapy use for metastatic head and neck squamous cell carcinomas are warranted. ","261":"Proton therapy is delivered to selected cancer patients presenting with rare tumours, for which a dose escalation paradigm and\/or a reduced dose-bath to the organs at risk is pursued. It is a costly treatment with an additional cost factor of 2-3 when compared to photon radiotherapy. Notwithstanding the 180'000 patients treated with protons, scars robust clinical evidence is available to justify the administration of this treatment modality. The European Particle Therapy Network (EPTN) was created in 2015 to answer the critical European needs for cooperation among protons and carbon ions centres in the framework of clinical research networks. EPTN with other European groups will launch a number of prospective clinical trials that could be practice changing if positive. Alternative way to generate clinical data could be provided by alternative methodologies, such as the Dutch model-based approach, or could be provided by European infrastructure projects.","262":"Brachytherapy is part of the treatment of locally advanced cervical cancers, accounting for about half of the total delivered dose. The benefit of dose escalation is the most important in advanced cases or if the tumor has responded poorly. The use of interstitial implantations makes it possible to reach doses of the order of 85 to 90Gy (including external beam radiotherapy contribution) in most patients, through image-guided approaches. Brachytherapy delivery is one of the quality criteria for patient care. To date, no data allow us to consider as an alternative the use of external boost through intensity-modulated or stereotactic body radiotherapy. Indeed, the doses delivered to the tumor and the capacity to spare normal tissues remains lower, as compared to what is permitted by brachytherapy. It is therefore appropriate for centers that do not have access to the technique to establish networks with centers where brachytherapy is performed, to allow each patient to have access to the technique. It is also necessary to promote brachytherapy teaching. The issue of reimbursement will be crucial in the coming years to maintain expertise that is today insufficiently valued in its financial aspects, but has a very high added value for patients.","263":"Neurocytomas represent 0,25 to 0,5 of brain tumours. These tumours have neuronal differentiation. It's a young adult disease. The main treatment is neurosurgery. The place of other therapies is still unclear, noticeably with regards to radiotherapy. This review aim is to determine the place and the modalities of radiotherapy in the management of neurocytomas. A literature search using PubMed allowed to select the most relevant studies. Finally, 22 studies were selected according to pre-established criteria to answer the problem. All studies were retrospective studies except one. The analysis conclusion defined radiotherapy as a treatment of choice in selected patients, when surgical resection was incomplete or when tumour was atypical.","264":"New concepts of medical consultations are currently disrupting the practice of medicine. The use of standardized questionnaires, or patient-reported outcome (PRO and ePRO) has already significantly changed the relationship between the physician and the patient. Telemedicine, or even automatic conversational agents, such as chatbots, are also providing more convenient access to care and medical information for many patients. These tools have a major impact in oncology, precisely because of the rising chronicity of the diseases the radiation oncologists treat. In this article, we provide a detailed analysis of these new concepts.","265":"Prescription and delivery of protons are somewhat different compared to photons and may influence outcomes (tumour control and toxicity). These differences should be taken into account to fully exploit the clinical potential of proton therapy. Innovations in proton therapy treatment are also required to widen the therapeutic window and determine appropriate populations of patients that would benefit from new treatments. Therefore, strategies are now being developed to reduce side effects to critical normal tissues using alternative treatment configurations and new spatial or temporal-driven optimisation approaches. Indeed, spatiotemporal optimisation (based on flash, proton minibeam radiation therapy or hypofractionated delivery methods) has been gaining some attention in proton therapy as a mean of improving (biological and physical) dose distribution. In this short review, the main differences in planning and delivery between protons and photons, as well as some of the latest developments and methodological issues (in silico modelling) related to providing scientific evidence for these new techniques will be discussed.","266":null,"267":"","268":"The aim of the present paper is to systematically review all available literature on preradiotherapy high uptake areas (hotspots) as a potential target for dose escalation in different tumour sites, and to understand the potential role and limitations of fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-positron-emission tomography (PET)\/computed tomography (CT) in this context. An electronic database (Medline) search was conducted to identify articles reporting on a correlation between high tracer uptake on pretreatment PET and preferential sites of local recurrence after radiotherapy. Search was limited to English language. No date range limitation was applied. Among 45 studies initially identified, nine series matching with inclusion criteria have finally been retained from the literature after reviewing (5 retrospective and 4 prospective). Primary tumour locations were head-neck (n=2), lung (n=4), oesophageal (n=2) and rectal (n=1) areas. Overlaps between FDG hotspot on preradiotherapy PET\/CT and site of local recurrence on post-treatment scan showed good to excellent agreement. Only studies on head-neck cancer reported moderate agreement probably explained by the lack of reproducibility of the patients positioning between pre- and post-treatment FDG-PET\/CT; and by the rigid registration process of images limited by post-therapeutic changes that highly affect anatomical landmarks. FDG hotspot-guided radiotherapy may allow dose escalation in respecting a robust methodology (treatment position, co-registration method, four-dimensional PET).","269":"Because of its principle and its high proof level clinical results, brachytherapy represents a specific irradiation technique for the treatment of primary tumors as well as some local relapses in pre-irradiated area. After a glory period between the 80's and 90's, brachytherapy has progressively lost its attractiveness. In order to provide a practical solution to this deleterious situation, it is important that guardianships, health care payers, patient associations, specialist doctors and radiation oncologists understand the reasons leading to this harmful state as well as the risks concerned. A teaching judged insufficient, non-adapted value and an aging image of brachytherapy represent the three main reasons of this degradation and constitute the three most important challenges conditioning its maintain in the anticancer treatment arsenal. An adapted communication with radiation oncologists themselves but also with the other scientific societies remains crucial as well as with guardianship and patient associations. It is central that brachytherapy could be recognized in order to make it stronger and accessible for all the patients who could need it.","270":"The optimal management of locally recurrent prostate cancer after curative radiotherapy is still unknown. In this study, we evaluated the preliminary results of reirradiation using stereotactic body radiotherapy for locally recurrent prostate cancer after initial definitive local radiotherapy. Between April 2016 and February 2019, 11 patients with recurrent disease at the previously irradiated prostate were treated. Local recurrence was detected by radiological with or without functional imaging modalities including prostate multiparametric\/pelvic MRI or positron-emission tomography-computerised tomography with (68Ga)-labelled prostate-specific membrane antigen performed after rising prostate specific antigen serum level during follow-up. All patients received stereotactic body radiotherapy to the recurrent nodule to a total dose of 30Gy in five fractions. Hyaluronic acid spacer was injected between prostate and rectum in seven patients to decrease the rectal dose. Acute toxicity was evaluated by using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events version 4.0, and late toxicity was evaluated by using Radiation Therapy Oncology Group\/European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer late radiation morbidity scoring schema. At the diagnosis, the median age was 64 years, and the mean prostate specific antigen serum concentration was 17.7ng\/mL. The median interval time between local recurrence and initial definitive radiotherapy was 63 months. Mean prostate specific antigen concentration nadir value during follow-up was 0.43ng\/mL. With a median follow up of 19 months, three patients developed either local or distant relapse. One patient had grade 3 acute rectal toxicity, and one patient had grade 2 late urinary toxicity. We did not observe any acute or late toxicity due to hyaluronic acid spacer injection. Reirradiation after local recurrence following initial definitive radiotherapy together with hyaluronic acid spacer use seems to be effective and safe. ","271":"The increasing use of stereotactic body radiation therapy for lung tumours comes along with new post-therapeutic imaging findings that should be known by physicians involved in patient follow-up. Radiation-induced lung injury is much more frequent than after conventional radiation therapy, it can also be delayed and has a different radiological presentation. Radiation-induced lung injury after stereotactic body radiation therapy involves the lung parenchyma surrounding the target tumour and appears as a dynamic process continuing for years after completion of the treatment. Thus, the radiological pattern and the severity of radiation-induced lung injury are prone to changes during follow-up, which can make it difficult to differentiate from local recurrence. Contrary to radiation-induced lung injury, local recurrence after stereotactic body radiation therapy is rare. Other complications mainly depend on tumour location and include airway complications, rib fractures and organizing pneumonia. The aim of this article is to provide a wide overview of radiological changes occurring after SBRT for lung tumours. Awareness of changes following stereotactic body radiation therapy should help avoiding unnecessary interventions for pseudo tumoral presentations.","272":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate MRI and fluorocholine PET\/CT diagnostic performances for the detection of local recurrence following prostate brachytherapy for localised prostate cancer. In this single-centre study, we retrospectively reviewed data from 21 patients treated by brachytherapy for localised prostate cancer and diagnosed with biochemical recurrence according to Phoenix Criteria, who underwent MRI and fluorocholine PET\/CT. We included patients with local relapse suspicion according to imaging exams, with biopsy for the final assessment of local recurrence. Patient analysis data were supplemented by segment analysis using an 8-segment model. The fluorocholine PET\/CT was positive for 81% and negative for 19% of patients. The sensitivity and specificity were 92% and 33% with diagnosis accuracy of 67%. The MRI was positive for 57% and negative for 43% of patients. The sensitivity and specificity were 67% and 56% with diagnosis accuracy of 62%. There was no statistically significant difference between fluorocholine PET\/CT and MRI accuracy (P=0.63). On a segment-based analysis, the sensitivity and specificity were 44% and 82% for fluorocholine PET\/CT with diagnosis accuracy of 78%. For MRI, specificity was 91% diagnosis accuracy was 82%. Both MRI and fluorocholine PET\/CT permit to highlight local recurrence sites after prostate brachytherapy. Confirmation biopsies are, however, necessary since this accuracy is insufficient. ","273":"Therapeutic advances in oncology have led to longer survival in many forms of cancer, including those complicated by bone metastases. When a bone metastasis is painful or when there is a risk of fracture, interventional radiology procedures can be carried out for pain control and\/or stabilisation. All of these techniques can be performed under local anaesthesia. Cementoplasty and vertebroplasty are stabilisation procedures consisting in the percutaneous injection of acrylic cement into a lytic bone lesion. The effect on pain can be explained by the consolidation of weakened, fractured or pre-fractured bone, but also to a lesser extent by the toxic, chemical and thermal effect of the cement. Tumour ablation techniques include alcoholisation or thermal ablation (by heat with radiofrequency and microwave or cold by cryoablation). Percutaneous thermal ablation of bone tumours is most often performed as a palliative measure resulting in a significant and lasting reduction in symptoms. Radiofrequency ablation consists in placing needles through which an electrical current passes. Microwave ablation acts by causing very high frequency vibrations of water molecules. Cryoablation releases argon gas at the tip of the needle, forming an \"ice ball\" effectively destroying tumour cells. Any of these techniques can be combined to radiation therapy, performed before or after radiation. Finally, tumour embolisation can have a goal of pain control, or preparation of surgery to reduce the risk of peroperative haemorrhage.","274":"Improved computer resources in radiation oncology department have greatly facilitated the integration of multimodal imaging into the workflow of radiation therapy. Nowadays, physicians have highly informative imaging modalities of the anatomical region to be treated. These images contribute to the targeting accuracy with the current treatment device, impacting both segmentation or patient's positioning. Additionally, in a constant effort to deliver personalized care, many teams seek to confirm the benefits of adaptive radiotherapy. The published works highlight the importance of registration algorithms, particularly those of elastic or deformable registration necessary to take into account the anatomical evolutions of the patients during the course of their therapy. These algorithms, often considered as \"black boxes\", tend to be better controlled and understood by physicists and physicians thanks to the generalization of evaluation and validation methods. Given the still significant development of medical imaging techniques, it is foreseeable that multimodal registration needs require more efficient algorithms well integrated within the flow of data.","275":"Numerous articles have been published showing the interest to delineate tumours using fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography\/computed tomography images in radiotherapy planning. This imaging is used to identify tumour tissues with increased glucose metabolism compared to healthy surrounding tissues. This volume corresponds to the metabolic tumour volume. Despite extensive research on metabolic tumour volume segmentation methods, there is currently no consensus on the optimal segmentation method to use. In this review, the main methods proposed in the literature are presented, as well as their advantages and disadvantages in the context of radiotherapy.","276":null,"277":null,"278":"The assessment of tumour response during and after radiotherapy determines the subsequent management of patients (adaptation of treatment plan, monitoring, adjuvant treatment, rescue treatment or palliative care). In addition to its role in extension assessment and therapeutic planning, positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography provides useful functional information for the evaluation of tumour response. The objective of this article is to review published data on positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography as a tool for evaluating external radiotherapy for cancers. Data on positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography scans acquired at different times (during, after initial and after definitive [chemo-]radiotherapy, during post-treatment follow-up) in solid tumours (lung, head and neck, cervix, oesophagus, prostate and rectum) were collected and analysed. Recent recommendations of the National Comprehensive Cancer Network are also reported. Positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography with (18F)-labelled fluorodeoxyglucose has a well-established role in clinical routine after chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced head and neck cancers, particularly to limit the number of neck lymph node dissection. This imaging modality also has a place for the evaluation of initial chemoradiotherapy of oesophageal cancer, including the detection of distant metastases, and for the post-therapeutic evaluation of cervical cancer. Several radiotracers for positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography, such as choline, are also recommended for patients with prostate cancer with biochemical failure. (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography combined with computed tomography is optional in many other circumstances and its clinical benefits, possibly in combination with MRI, to assess response to radiotherapy remain a very active area of research.","279":null,"280":null,"281":null,"282":"The present study evaluated the outcomes of concurrent weekly docetaxel and platinum-based drug doublet in association with concurrent thoracic radiotherapy (TR) in the curative treatment of stage III locally advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Patients with stage IIIA\/B NSCLC were retrospectively included. Patients received weekly docetaxel and either cisplatin or carboplatin intravenous injections during concurrent TR (60 to 66Gy). Patients who received induction chemotherapy with the same drug doublet were also included. The endpoints were: disease control rate (DCR), overall recurrence rate, survival rates [disease-free survival (DFS) and overall survival (OS)] and toxicity. Eighty-nine consecutive patients treated with this association were included. Median follow-up time was 57.8 months. DCR was 76.5% at the first follow-up CT scan (6 to 12 weeks after the end of concurrent treatment). Median DFS and OS was 14.3 and 29.9 months respectively. Three-year survival was 43%. The overall recurrence rate was 65.9%. During overall treatment, grade 3 to 4 adverse events occurred in 29.2% of patients, the most common being esophagitis (12.4% of patients). Only 13.5% of patients presented with a grade 3 or higher adverse event after the end of concurrent treatment. Weekly docetaxel and platinum-based drug doublet combined with TR yielded promising results in stage III NSCLC, with high survival rates. The toxicity of this association is acceptable, with mainly manageable esophagitis. These findings warrant validation in a prospective study before considering this association for standard of care.

This treatment is delivered by three dimensional conformal irradiation, which is usually well tolerated but can induce potential toxicity such as rectitis, cystitis and hematologic adverse effects. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy, widely available nowadays, allows optimization of volume covering and sparing of organs at risk such as bladder and bone marrow. This review presents relevant clinical situations and requirements for a beneficial and safe preoperative irradiation of rectal cancers by intensity-modulated technique. This technique is compared to three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy.","287":"Imaging is involved in the management of uterine cervical cancer with several objectives: 1\/to assess local and lymph node extension of the initial disease; 2\/evaluate treatment response to conservative therapy; 3\/detect recurrences. Pelvic MRI is the first-line examination in all these indications. It is the key element for delineation after image fusion when the indication of chemoradiation therapy is made. It is also essential for guiding the placement of applicators and optimising the dosimetry of brachytherapy. The diffusion-weighted acquisition is a sequence sensitive to the motion of water molecules. It allows distinguishing water molecules with free diffusion from water molecules with diffusion restricted by obstacles such as cell membranes or the cytoskeleton. The diffusion is thus connected to the cellularity of the explored tissue, and the cancers, being hypercellular, will present a high signal. It thus provides additional information thanks to a high contrast between the tumour and the surrounding tissues, facilitating detection, evaluation of the volume and extent of the disease.","288":null,"289":"Overall treatment time is an important factor of local recurrence and indirectly of distant evolution, namely in case of protracted treatments. The current pandemic impacts on the duration of radiotherapy if patients under treatments and synchronously suffering from COVID-19. The models used to compensate the total dose in case of temporary treatment interruption are well known but it is of importance in that pandemic context to update and homogenize clinical practice in order to improve local control without increasing normal tissue complications.","290":"","291":"Therapeutic effectiveness in radiotherapy is partly related to correct staging of the disease and then precise therapeutic targeting. Positron emission tomography (PET) allows the stage of many cancers to be determined and therefore is essential before deciding on radiation treatment. The definition of the therapeutic target is essential to obtain correct tumour control and limit side effects. The part of adaptive radiotherapy remains to be defined, but PET by its functional nature makes it possible to define the prognosis of many cancers and to consider radiotherapy adapted to the initial response allowing an increase over the entire metabolic volume, or targeted at a subvolume at risk per dose painting, or with a decrease in the dose in case of good response at interim assessment.","292":"Neuroimaging and especially MRI has emerged as a necessary imaging modality to detect, measure, characterize and monitor brain tumours. Advanced MRI sequences such as perfusion MRI, diffusion MRI and spectroscopy as well as new post-processing techniques such as automatic segmentation of tumours and radiomics play a crucial role in characterization and follow up of brain tumours. The purpose of this review is to provide an overview on anatomical and functional MRI use for brain tumours boundaries determination and tumour characterization in the specific context of radiotherapy. The usefulness of anatomical and functional MRI on particular challenges posed by radiotherapy such as pseudo progression and pseudo esponse and new treatment strategies such as dose painting is also described.","293":"Among the available imaging techniques, functional imaging provided by nuclear medicine departments represents a tool of choice for the oncoradiotherapist for targeting tumour activity, with positron emission tomography as the main modality. Before, during or after radiotherapy, functional imaging helps guide the oncoradiotherapist in making decisions and in the strategic choice of pathology management. Setting up a working group to ensure perfect coordination at all levels is the first step. Key points for a common and coordinated management between the two departments are the definition of an organizational logistic, training of personnel at every levels, standardization of nomenclatures, the choice of adapted and common equipment, implementation of regulatory controls, and research\/clinical routine continuum. The availability of functional examinations dedicated to radiotherapy in clinical routine is possible and requires a convergence of teams and a pooling of tools and techniques.","294":"Radiomics are a set of methods used to leverage medical imaging and extract quantitative features that can characterize a patient's phenotype. All modalities can be used with several different software packages. Specific informatics methods can then be used to create meaningful predictive models. In this review, we will explain the major steps of a radiomics analysis pipeline and then present the studies published in the context of radiation therapy. A literature review was performed on Medline using the search engine PubMed. The search strategy included the search terms \"radiotherapy\", \"radiation oncology\" and \"radiomics\". The search was conducted in July 2019 and reference lists of selected articles were hand searched for relevance to this review. A typical radiomics workflow always includes five steps: imaging and segmenting, data curation and preparation, feature extraction, exploration and selection and finally modeling. In radiation oncology, radiomics studies have been published to explore different clinical outcome in lung (n=5), head and neck (n=5), esophageal (n=3), rectal (n=3), pancreatic (n=2) cancer and brain metastases (n=2). The quality of these retrospective studies is heterogeneous and their results have not been translated to the clinic. Radiomics has a great potential to predict clinical outcome and better personalize treatment. But the field is still young and constantly evolving. Improvement in bias reduction techniques and multicenter studies will hopefully allow more robust and generalizable models. ","295":"Radiation therapy has undergone significant advances these last decades, particularly thanks to technical improvements, computer science and a better ability to define the target volumes via morphological and functional imaging breakthroughs. Imaging contributes to all three stages of patient care in radiation oncology: before, during and after treatment. Before the treatment, the choice of optimal imaging type and, if necessary, the adequate functional tracer will allow a better definition of the volume target. During radiation therapy, image-guidance aims at locating the tumour target and tailoring the volume target to anatomical and tumoral variations. Imaging systems are now integrated with conventional accelerators, and newer accelerators have techniques allowing tumour tracking during the irradiation. More recently, MRI-guided systems have been developed, and are already active in a few French centres. Finally, after radiotherapy, imaging plays a major role in most patients' monitoring, and must take into account post-radiation tissue modification specificities. In this review, we will focus on the ongoing projects of nuclear imaging in oncology, and how they can help the radiation oncologist to better treat patients. To this end, a literature review including the terms \"Radiotherapy\", \"Radiation Oncology\" and \"PET-CT\" was performed in August 2019 on Medline and ClinicalTrials.gov. We chose to review successively these novelties organ-by-organ, focusing on the most promising advances. As a conclusion, the help of modern functional imaging thanks to a better definition and new specific radiopharmaceuticals tracers could allow even more precise treatments and enhanced surveillance. Finally, it could provide determinant information to artificial intelligence algorithms in \"-omics\" models.","296":"Computed tomography (CT) in the treatment position is currently indispensable for planning radiation therapy. Other imaging modalities, such as magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission-tomography (PET), can be used to improve the definition of the tumour and\/or healthy tissue but also to provide functional data of the target volume. Accurate image registration is essential for treatment planning, so MRI and PET scans should be registered at the planning CT scan. Hybrid PET\/MRI scans with a hard plane can be used but pose the problem of the absence of CT scans. Finally, techniques for moving the patient on a rigid air-cushioned table allow PET\/CT\/MRI scans to be performed in the treatment position while limiting the patient's movements exist. At the same time, the advent of MRI-linear accelerator systems allows to redefine image-guided radiotherapy and to propose treatments with daily recalculation of the dose. The place of PET during treatment remains more confidential and currently only in research and prototype status. The same development of imaging during radiotherapy is underway in proton therapy.","297":"Imaging is critical to each step of precision radiation therapy, i.e. planning, setup, delivery and assessment of response. Hadrontherapy can be considered to deliver more precise dose distribution that may better spare normal tissues from intermediate low doses of radiation. In addition, hadrontherapy using high linear energy transfer ions may also be used for dose escalation on biological target volumes defined by functional imaging. However, the physical characteristics of hadrontherapy also make it more demanding in terms of imaging accuracy and image-based dose calculation. Some of the developments needed in imaging are specific to hadrontherapy. The current review addresses current status of imaging in proton therapy and the drawbacks of photon-based imaging for hadrons. It also addresses requirements in hadrontherapy planning with respect to multimodal imaging for proper target and organ at risk definition as well as to target putative radioresistant areas such as hypoxic ones, and with respect to dose calculation using dual energy CT, MR-proton therapy, proton radiography. Imaging modalities, such as those used in photon-based radiotherapy (intensity modulated and stereotactic radiotherapy), are somewhat already implemented or should be reaching \"routine\" hadrontherapy (at least proton therapy) practice in planning, repositioning and response evaluation optimizable within the next five years. Online monitoring imaging by PET, as currently developed for hadrontherapy, is already available. Its spatiotemporal limits restrict its use but similar to prompt gamma detection, represents an area of active research for the next 5 to 10 years. Because of the more demanding and specific dose deposit characteristics, developments image-guided hadrontherapy, such as specific proton imaging using tomography or ionoacoustics, as well as delivery with MR-proton therapy, may take another 10 years to reach the clinics in specific applications. Other aspects are briefly described such as range monitoring. Finally, the potential of imaging normal tissue changes and challenges to assess tumour response are discussed.","298":"The incidence of oropharyngeal cancer induced by human papillomavirus (HPV) infection is steadily increasing in developed countries. These tumors are more chemoradiosensitive and have a better prognosis than HPV-negative one. In addition, they occur in younger and better-off patients with longer life expectancy. Current radiotherapy and chemotherapy protocols are currently being questioned as they may expose HPV-positive patients to excessive treatment and unnecessary toxic effects. Less intensive treatment regimens could possibly achieve similar efficacy with lower toxicity and improved quality of life. The aim of this work was to summarize the knowledge on these tumors and their implications for radiation oncologists. In this update, we will discuss ongoing de-escalation trials and highlight the issues raised by these studies. We will also comment on the results of recently published de-intensification studies. Three main strategies are analyzed in the present article: the de-escalation of the drug associated with radiotherapy, the de-escalation of the radiotherapy dose (in concomitant chemoradiotherapy, after induction chemotherapy, in a postoperative setting) and de-escalation of radiation target volumes. Our findings ultimately indicate that clinicians should not change the management of oropharyngeal cancer patients outside of clinical trials.","299":"Shielding disks play an important role in intraoperative electron radiation therapy, and different designs are currently used in clinical practice. This paper investigates the dosimetric impact of the shielding disk used during intraoperative electron radiation therapy (IOERT). This paper focuses on the study of four shielding disks types that have been used in our clinic: Aluminum (Al)\/Lead (Pb), PMMA\/Copper(Cu)\/PMMA, Aluminum (Al)\/Copper (Cu) and Aluminum (Al)\/Steel with their specific thicknesses. The theoretical study was conducted with the EGSnrc Monte Carlo (MC) code. On the other hand, the measurements were carried out with gafchromic films for the four shielding disks for the same setup inside the water phantom. Finally, a comparison of the simulated and measured PDD curves was performed for the four material combinations. MC simulation and gafchromic measurements illustrated that dose values under the four shielding disks types were close to 0, whereas the backscattering enhancement of the disks were 103% with Al\/Pb shielding disk, 102% with Al\/Steel shielding disk, 102% with Al\/Cu shielding disk, 95% with PMMA\/Cu\/PMMA shielding disk. The PDDs values of the gafchromic films in front of the disks were: 107%, 105%, 104%, and 94% for the Al\/Pb, Al\/Steel, Al\/Cu, and PMMA\/Cu\/PMMA disks respectively. The dose values above and under the shielding disks were acceptable for the four studied shielding types. Demonstrated it is possible to use any of them clinically, while the best shielding disk was the Al\/Pb since it has minimum thickness and a small backscatter enhancement. ","300":"In radiotherapy, the dose prescription is currently based on discretized dose-effects records that do not take into fully account for the complexity of the patient-dose-response relationship. Their predictive performance on both anti-tumour efficacy and toxicity can be optimized by integrating radiobiological models. It is with this in mind that the calculation models TCP (Tumor Control Probability) and NTCP (Normal Tissue Complication Probability) have been developed. Their construction involves several important steps that are necessary and important to understand. The first step is based on radiobiological models allowing to calculate according to more or less complexity the rate of surviving cells after irradiation. Two additional steps are required to convert the physical dose into an equivalent biological dose, in particular a 2Gy equivalent biological dose (EQD2): first to take into account the effect of the fractionation of the dose for both the target volume and the organs at risk; second to convert an heterogeneous dose to an organ into an homogeneous dose having the same effect (Niemierko generalized equivalent uniform dose (gEUD)). Finally, the process of predicting clinical effects based on radiobiological models transform doses into tumour control (TCP) or toxicity (NTCP) probabilities using parameters that reflect the radiobiological characteristics of the tissues in question. The use of these models in current practice is still limited, but since the radiotherapy softwares increasingly integrate them, it is important to know the principle and limits of application of these models.","301":"Stereotactic radiosurgery (SRS) is a non-invasive technique that enables to create brain focal lesions with a high precision and localization. Thus, functional brain disorders can be treated by SRS in case of pharmacoresistance or inoperability. To date, treatment of trigeminal neuralgia is the most described and known indication. Other indications will be developed in the future like movement disorders, refractory epilepsy, obsessive compulsive disorder and severe depression. We present here a review of actual and future indications of functional brain SRS with their level of evidence. All these SRS treatments have to be strictly conducted by trained teams with an excellent collaboration between radiation physicists, medical physicists, neurosurgeons, neurologists, psychiatrists and probably neuroradiologists.","302":null,"303":"We report the case of an 84-year-old woman with poorly differentiated non-small cell carcinoma of the right parotid who presented with headache, was found to have a primary right parotid gland cancer as well as metastatic disease, and underwent palliative radiotherapy to the primary site.

The patient remained free of disease for about one year before progression. The case is a rare instance of abscopal regression of metastatic disease in the absence of pharmacologic immunomodulation.

To compare DIAG and RT setups, signal-to-noise-ratio (SNR) and percentage-image-uniformity (PIU) were computed on T1 images of phantoms and volunteers. Influence of the sample conductivity on SNR was quantified using homemade phantoms. To obtain reliable T1 and T2 images for RT-planning, an experimental design was performed on volunteers by using SNR, contrast-to-noise-ratio (CNR) and mean-opinion-score (MOS). Further, pseudo-CTs were generated from 8 patients T2 images with a state-of-art deep-learning method. These pseudo-CTs were evaluated by mean-absolute-error (MAE) and mean-error (ME). SNR was higher for DIAG-setup compared to RT-setup (SNR-ratio=1.3). A clear influence of the conductivity on SNR was observed. PIU was higher for DIAG-setup (38.8%) compared to RT-setup (33.5%). Regarding the protocol optimisation, SNR, CNR, and MOS were 20.6, 6.16, and 3.91 for the optimal T1 sequence. For the optimal T2 sequence, SNR, CNR and MOS were 25.6, 44.46 and 4.0. In the whole head-and-neck area, the mean MAE and ME of the pseudo-CTs were 82.8 and -3.9 HU. We quantified the image quality decrease induces by using an RT-setup for head-and-neck radiotherapy.

A comparison of the clinical target volume and the doses received by the rectum and bladder was performed in order to determine the best method of treatment and to optimize the dose distribution. 95 patients were treated in both departments. The average values of the D95% dose received by the CTV were respectively 89.43% for the Stump Cylinder and 110.16% for the custom mold. The conformity index was 0.84 for the Stump Cylinder while it was 0.97 for the custom mold, which ensures a better dose distribution. For the rectum, the maximum dose D2cc taken by volume was 71.23% for the Stump Cylinder and 79.51% for the custom mold. The bladder was better protected with Stump Cylinder with a D2cc value of 65.81% against 94.88% for the custom mold. The underdosing obtained using the Stump Cylinder was due to the shape of upper part of the cylinder which was not conform with the shape of the vaginal vault in women. A better protection of the organs at risk was observed with the Stump Cylinder since the dose taken by the rectum and bladder using a custom mold can reach the tolerance limits.

Locally advanced and\/or high-risk cancer is defined based on clinical stage, initial prostate specific antigen serum concentration value or high Gleason score. Hormone therapy associated with radiation therapy is the standard of management and improves local control, reduces the risk of distant metastasis and improves specific and overall survival. Duration of hormone therapy, dose level of radiation therapy alone or associated with brachytherapy are controversial data in the literature. The therapeutic choice, multidisciplinary, depends on the age and comorbidity of the patient, the prognostic criteria of the pathology and the urinary function of the patient.

Approximately, 70% of cancer patients receive RT in China. The immune-modulating effect of radiation therapy have gained considerable interest in recent years and there have been multiple reports of synergy between radiation and immunotherapy. Regulatory T cells (Tregs) are a group of T cell subsets with immunosuppressive function, which is correlated with cancer. Tregs are involved in the pathogenesis, development, treatment and prognosis of tumors by cell-cell contact, cytokines, and cell metabolism. Based on the immunological characteristics of Tregs, this article reviews the interaction between RT and immune molecules, aiming to provide new ideas for RT combined with immunotherapy.","322":"The discovery of immunotherapy led to understand the major role of immune system during the tumor process. Conventional treatments, such as chemotherapy, are directly tumoricidal. New drugs are developed to target specifically the immune system to make it regain its ability to recognize and eliminate cancer cells. Radiotherapy is used for a long time for its local action, but its systemic role, based on its impact on immunity, is now better known. Breast cancer was wrongly considered poorly immunogenic and put aside the amazing progress in this new area of treatment. In this article, we would like to present the pre-clinical and clinical rationales to associate immunotherapy to radiotherapy in the management of breast cancer.","323":"The role of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) in treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is controversial. The aim of this study was to systematically evaluate the efficacy and safety of using PCI in the treatment of extensive-stage SCLC. In the present study, we examined whether PCI was essential for the optimal treatment of extensive-disease small-cell lung cancer. We searched the PubMed, Embase, Medline, and China National Knowledge Infrastructure databases to identify articles that assessed the efficacy of PCI in treating extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer patients. We identified 8 studies that involved a total of 982 patients who received PCI (PCI group) and a total of 4509 patients who did not receive PCI (control group). The results showed that PCI significantly improved the 1-year overall survival rate (HR=1.50; 95% CI: 1.23-1.82; I2=67%; P&lt;0.0001) and reduced the incidence of brain metastasis (HR=0.46; 95% CI: 0.37-0.58; I2=6%; P&lt;0.00001). PCI improves the 1-year overall survival rate and reduces the risk of brain metastasis in patients with extensive-stage SCLC.

It is already well-established regarding local control and toxicity for intra-operative radiotherapy using electrons as we now have the necessary background knowledge. However, very few data on later toxicity are available for intra-operative radiotherapy using low-energy photons. We report here the case of a 36-year-old woman who experienced rib fracture following intra-operative and external radiotherapy. This patient has been included in the Targit-boost trial.

The aim of this study is to compare overall survival (OS) using 3D radiotherapy (3DRT) alone with concurrent chemoradiotherapy (CCRT) in 296 non-surgical esophageal carcinoma patients. Over 10 years, of the 480 patients with esophageal carcinoma treated with 3DRT with or without chemotherapy, 148 patients each comprised 3DRT and CCRT groups after propensity score matching. The 5- and 10-year OS (P=0.337) and PFS (P=0.715) rates for 3DRT alone were 22.0%, 14.4% and 26.1%, 23.2%, respectively, compared with 28.8%, 18.6% and 34.7%, 29.1% for CCRT, respectively. CCRT did not improve 5-year and 10-year OS or PFS in 60-70Gy group (OS: 27.5% and 25.2%; 17.9% and 17.0%, P=0.938; PFS: 38.3% and 31.8%; 31.9% and 27.8%, P=0.890) nor reduce 10-year hematogenous metastasis (31.7% and 28.3%, P=0.698).

Thirty-seven patients were treated using a dual-arc VMAT approach for supratentorial glioblastoma between 2016 and 2018. The total dose of 60Gy in 30 daily fractions was administered to the planning target volume (PTV). The brain structures that play an important role in cognitive physiology, such as the hippocampi, corpus callosum, cerebellum, subventricular zones (SVZ), were delineated. For each patient, a new treatment plan in HT was determined by a second medical physicist in a blindly fashion according to the same dose constraints and priorities. Statistical analyses were performed using the Wilcoxon-signed rank test. Conformity indexes remained similar with both techniques. The mean values were 0.96 (0.19-1.00) for VMAT and 0.98 (range, 0.84-1.00) for HT, respectively (P=0.73). Significant D50% reductions were observed with VMAT compared to HT: 14.6Gy (3.8-28.0) versus 17.4Gy (12.1-25.0) for the normal brain (P=0.014); 32.5Gy (10.3-60.0) versus 35.6Gy (17.1-58.0) for the corpus callosum (P=0.038); 8.1Gy (0.4-34.0) versus 12.8Gy (0.8-27.0) for the cerebellum (P&lt;0.001), respectively.

The present study aimed at identifying the correlation between numerous clinical and tumoral factors and asthenia in breast and prostate cancer patients treated by curative radiotherapy. A retrospective study was conducted at the Lucien Neuwirth Cancer Institute (France). All breast and prostate cancer patients undergoing curative radiotherapy during 2015 were screened (n=806). Patient's self-evaluation of asthenia and radiotherapy tolerance was assessed through verbal analogic scale (0\/10 to 10\/10). Data about toxicities, travel distance and travel time, tumor's characteristics, radiotherapy treatment planning, previous cancer therapies, were collected from medical records. 500 patients were included (350 in the breast cancer group and 150 in the prostate cancer group). In all, 86% of patients in the breast cancer group reported asthenia, with a 5\/10 median score. In all, 54% of patients in the prostate cancer group reported asthenia, with a 2\/10 median score. Univariate analysis showed correlation between asthenia and radiotherapy tolerance as well as tumor staging, in the prostate cancer group. No other correlation was evidenced. Radiotherapy-related fatigue is a common side effect. This study showed that most of the factors related to patients or disease that are commonly used to explain fatigue during curative treatments, seem finally to be not correlated with asthenia.

A major decrease was observed in the number of patients treated: 360 in 2016 in contrast to 954 in 1999 and 1113 in 1995. The most frequent indications remain the prevention of heterotopic bone formation, keloids or gynecomastia. A new indication was observed: trigeminal nevralgia treated with radiosurgery. Two frequent indications in the past disappeared: the prevention of coronary restenosis and the macular degeneration.

This is a retrospective review of 12 patients monitored and treated in the radiotherapy department of the Mohammed-V military medical teaching hospital in Rabat for a solitary bone plasmocytoma between January 2012 and December 2018. The average age of our patients were 53.8 years old (range: 31-72 years old). Pain was the most common telltale sign. The site of the lesions was spinal in four cases, iliac in four cases, mandibular, ribal, humeral and at the level of the astragalus in one case respectively. All patients received radiotherapy. This irradiation was delivered alone in 60% of cases or associated with surgery in 40% of cases. The average dose of radiotherapy was 47.3Gy (range: 45 to 50.4Gy) and this was delivered by a modulated volumetric arc therapy technique in ten patients and conformal tridimensional radiotherapy in two patients. Local control, defined by stability or radiological regression, was obtained in ten patients and four patients progressed to multiple myeloma, two of whom died. The average duration of follow-up was 51 months. Radiation therapy is the standard treatment for solitary bone plasmocytoma. It ensures good local control in 90% of cases. The prognosis is affected by progression to multiple myeloma, which justifies rigorous monitoring after treatment and suggests a reflection on the exact place of chemotherapy.

Combined with radiomics, neural networks have obtained good results in image classification, natural language processing, phenotyping based on electronic health records, and adaptive radiation therapy. General adversial networks have been tested to generate synthetic data. Logics based systems have been developed for providing formal domain ontologies, supporting clinical decision and checking consistency of the systems. Artificial intelligence must integrate both deep learning and logic approaches to perform complex tasks and go beyond the so-called narrow artificial intelligence that is tailored to perform some highly specialized task.

Thirty patients underwent hypofractionated radiotherapy between 2007 and 2015. Overall, 17 patients underwent primary hypofractionated radiotherapy, nine underwent hypofractionated radiotherapy for reirradiation, and four received a boost dose via hypofractionated radiotherapy after external beam radiotherapy. Most common disease sites were head and neck and retroperitoneum. Hypofractionated radiotherapy was administered with a definitive, adjuvant, or neoadjuvant intent. Median age was 37 years (range: 11-82 years). Median hypofractionated radiotherapy dose was 35Gy (range: 20-50Gy) in three to five fractions. Median follow-up was 21 months (range: 1-108 months). One- and 2-year overall survival rate was 75% and 52%, respectively. One- and 2-year local recurrence-free survival rate was 59% and 48%, with local recurrence rates of 16% and 33% in 1 and 2 years, respectively. Univariate analysis revealed tumour size (P=0.04), hypofractionated radiotherapy intent (P=0.016) and reirradiation (P=0.001) as prognostic factors for local recurrence-free survival. Severe late toxicity was observed in one patient as grade 3 trismus. Hypofractionated radiotherapy as the primary treatment or for reirradiation has been shown to be safe in the treatment of bone and soft tissue sarcomas. It can provide relatively good local control and survival rates. ","338":"Radiotherapy is one of the most common form of treatment in oncology care. Indeed, radiotherapy proved to be very effective in treating a wide range of malignancies. Nevertheless, certain tumours are intrinsically radioresistant or may evolve to become radioresistant. Resistance to radiotherapy is often associated with dysregulated DNA damage response and repair. Recently, a number of strategies have been developed to improve radiotherapy efficacy by targeting the DNA damage response and repair pathways. Ongoing clinical trials showed the potential of some of these approaches in enhancing radiotherapy, but also highlighted the possible limitations. Here, we will describe (i) the main mechanisms involved in double-strand break repair; (ii) available strategies that target these DNA repair processes to improve radiotherapy and (iii) the clinical outcomes and challenges that have emerged so far.","339":"Due to high dose gradients, stereotactic body radiation therapy requires high precision in the location of the tumour. Uncertainties in the positioning can introduce serious damage on organs at risk and consequently can reduce tumour local control.

One year after, a fibroscopy showed a necrosis of the right main bronchus mucosae and the CT showed a radio-induced aneurysm protruding into the right inferior lobular bronchus. The patient eventually died a few hours later with a massive haemoptysis. This case highlights the potential toxicity of central lung stereotactic body radiation therapy and raises the question of its legitimacy.","341":null,"342":"Adjuvant radiotherapy is a key treatment in early-stage breast cancer. The meta-analysis by the Early Breast Cancer Trialist's Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) has demonstrated a decreased risk of locoregional relapse and death after whole-breast radiotherapy. Prophylactic lymph nodes irradiation in breast cancer has also proven to be beneficial in several therapeutic trials. At a time when three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy has become the standard procedure and with the development of intensity-modulated radiation therapy, defining nodal volumes is essential and practices should be harmonized to assess and compare the efficiency and toxicity of radiotherapy. Furthermore, the indication of lymph nodes irradiation has to take into account the risk\/benefit balance as expanding the irradiated volume can increase radio-induced toxicity. Selection of patients receiving this treatment is essential. The aim of this update is to define nodal volumes, to precise the indications of their irradiation and to present the expected benefits as well as the potential side effects.","343":null,"344":"Nanomedicine has undergone significant development since the 2000s and it is only very recently that two metallic nanoparticles have emerged in clinical trials.

The first nanoparticle used in humans is NBTXR3, composed of hafnium (Z=79), with intratumor injection for the treatment of sarcoma. Another gadolinium-based nanoparticle (Z=64), AGuIX, has been used for intravenous injection in the treatment of brain metastases. The preliminary results are promising in terms of feasibility, safety and efficacy, as evidenced by the significant number of ongoing clinical trials. The upcoming challenges for the development of nanoparticles will be the targeting of cancer cells, their biodistribution into the body, their eventual toxicity and their industrial production.

Examples of calculated dose (1D profiles and 2D dose distributions) and biological evidence obtained so far will be presented for various spatially fractionated techniques GRID, micro- and minibeam radiation therapy. Recent results demonstrating that proton minibeam radiation therapy leads to an increase in normal tissues sparing will be discussed, which opens the door to a dose escalation in the tumour and a possibly efficient treatment of very radioresistant tumours.","349":"Despite representing a 1% of diagnosed cancer cases in the USA and up to 5% in eastern Asia and Africa, oesophageal cancer still holds numerous questions concerning the best therapeutic management. For squamous cell carcinoma, while radiochemotherapy has proven itself to be the gold standard as part of the trimodality or alone as a definitive treatment, radiotherapy modalities are still debated especially regarding lymph node irradiation. Involved nodes irradiation was developed with the aim of maintaining clinical outcomes and enhancing quality of life but lacks grade 1 evidence. In this article, we aim to summarize the state of art regarding lymph node irradiation, discuss the impact of target definition, delivery techniques, concomitant treatment and the perspectives. Being highly connected to the lymph vessels, lymphatic metastases are frequent and can locate from the neck to the coeliac area with each node having a different prognostic significance. Regarding the comparison between elective nodal irradiation and involved nodes irradiation, evidence-based medicine mostly relies on retrospective studies. Pooled, it suggests similar clinical outcomes with lower acute toxicities in favour of involved nodes irradiation. However, delivery techniques, doses and concomitant treatment were not consensual. Studies are ongoing evaluating the impact of radiation delivery techniques and the choice of concomitant treatment, i.e. immunotherapy. Modern techniques of imaging, radiation therapy progressing each day and alternative treatment modalities being tested, the need of randomized controlled trials has never been so high. Elective nodal irradiation should remain the standard of care while phase 3 trials explore the safety of involved nodal irradiation.","350":"Stereotactic radiation therapy of brain metastases is a treatment recognized as effective, well tolerated, applicable for therapeutic indications codified and validated by national and international guidelines.

Proton therapy is a national priority for children and young adults in all three centres. The patient-related activity of the three French centres is coordinated via the Protonshare portal to optimise referral by type of indication and available expertise in coordination with the French society of radiation oncology SFRO and French radiotherapy centres. The centres are recognised by the French Health Care excellence initiative, promoted by the ministry of Foreign Affairs. The three centres collaborate structurally in terms of clinical research and are engaged at the international level in the participation to European databases and research initiatives. Concerted actions are now also promoted in preclinical research via the Radiotransnet network. Ongoing French developments in proton therapy are well presented in international hadron therapy meetings, including European Proton Therapy Network and Particle Therapy Cooperative Oncology Group. Proton therapy teaching in France is offered at several levels and is open to colleagues from all radiation oncology centres, so that they are fully informed, involved and trained to facility recognition of possible indications and thereby to contribute to appropriate patient referral. This close collaboration between all actors in French radiation oncology facilitates the work to demonstrate the required level of medical and scientific evidence for current and emerging indications for particle therapy. Based on that, the future might entail a possible creation of more proton therapy facilities in France.","352":"Intensity modulated radiotherapy combined with image guided radiotherapy has led to increase the precision of external beam radiotherapy. However, intra or inter-fraction anatomical variations are frequent during the treatment course and can cause under-dosing of the target volume and\/or over-dosing of the organs at risk. Several adaptive radiotherapy (ART) strategies can be defined to compensate these anatomical variations. The purpose of this article is to provide an overview of available ART strategies: offline, online, hybrid (library of treatment plans) or in real-time, while considering the arrival of MR-Linac devices in radiotherapy departments. The tools required to these ART strategies such as auto-segmentation, deformable image registration, calculation of the daily dose or dose accumulation, are also described. Implementing an ART strategy requires a rigorous quality assurance process, at each stage and on the entire workflow, as well as prior organization and training from of all the trades. A strong multidisciplinary involvement is finally required in order to ensure ART treatments.","353":"Chemoradiotherapy is now considered the standard of care for many locally advanced diseases. Cytotoxic drugs have been largely evaluated in this setting, with cisplatin and 5FU the most often used drugs. A large amount of pre-clinical studies has demonstrated the synergy between both modalities. Concomitant administration seems the more beneficial in many diseases. Emergence of new approaches, combining targeted therapies and radiotherapy (RT) is now a reality. The main example is the association of cetuximab and RT in head and neck carcinomas, even if, 14 years after the initial publication, the best way to use it is still unknown.

Quality of life remains a primary objective in the absence of superiority of one strategy over another in terms of specific survival with similar long-term biochemical control rates. Despite a significant decrease in digestive and urinary toxicities thanks to IMRT and IGRT, external radiotherapy remains a treatment that lasts approximately 2 months or 1.5 months, when combined with a brachytherapy boost. Given the specific radiosensitivity of this tumor, several randomized studies have shown that a hypofractionated scheme is not inferior in terms of biochemical control and toxicities, allowing to divide the number of fractions by a factor 2 to 8. Given that SBRT becomes a validated therapeutic option for a selected population of patients with localized prostate cancer, extreme hypofractionation is becoming a strong challenger of conventional external radiotherapy or brachytherapy.","358":null,"359":"Stereotactic radiotherapy of oligometastases, mono- or hypofractionated, represents a fundamental change in the practice of the specialty as it was developed for a century.

Four main phase II and III trials are underway in France. Future research concerns the association of stereotactic radiotherapy with immunotherapy or different conventional chemotherapy protocols, the identification of the best clinical presentations, and optimization of fractionation and biological dose for poor prognosis localizations.","360":"The conservative treatment of squamous cell carcinoma of anal canal by irradiation is recommended as first indication. Despite its rarity, significant improvements were obtained by retrospective or prospective clinical studies these 20 past years, evaluating concomitant chemotherapy and IMRT. Nevertheless, the individualisation of the treatment, over dose distribution, has poor data available. Fractionation remains classic (1.8-2.0Gy\/Fr), but the optimal dose level remains under discussion. The strategy concerning the volumes and doses for the prophylactic volumes remains under discussion. This paper will describe the data published, and the recommendations of working Groups, and the main options under evaluation. To conclude, today only the absence of gap is recommended, the benefit of a one-step schedule reducing the treatment time, then increasing local control and survival, but personalised schedules remain under investigation.","361":"HACCP method is used for quality insurance in the food industry for many years. It was adapted to radiotherapy to evaluate risk in the treatment process. This pragmatic approach led to the clear identification of different hazards along the process. It also allowed implementation of appropriate measures in order to reduce them.","362":"The treatment of cervical cancer patients relies on surgery and radiotherapy (according to the stage) and requires a multimodal discussion before any treatment to avoid adding the morbidities of each individual intervention and to optimize functional and oncological outcomes. The places of surgery and radiotherapy have been highlighted in recent international guidelines. For early stage tumors, an exclusive surgery with or without fertility sparing (according to well defined criteria) is the therapeutic standard. For tumors with risk factors (measuring more than 2cm in size and\/or presence of lymphovascular invasion) a preoperative brachytherapy can be proposed to minimize the need for postoperative external beam radiotherapy and optimize local control. For locally advanced disease, the standard treatment relies on chemoradiation followed by a brachytherapy boost. A primary paraaortic lymph node dissection may guide radiotherapy volumes and is useful to identify patients requiring a para-aortic radiotherapy. The technical evolutions of surgical approaches and technological improvement of radiotherapy and brachytherapy should be analyzed in the context of prospective studies. We review the literature on the respective places of radiotherapy and surgery for the treatment of cervical cancer.","363":"The ambition of the RADIOTRANSNET network, launched by the INCa at the end of 2018, is to create a French research consortium dedicated to preclinical radiotherapy to foster scientific and clinical interactions at the interface of radiotherapy and radiobiology, and to identify research priorities dedicated to innovation in radiotherapy. The activities of the network are organized around four major axes that are target definition, normal tissue, combined treatments and dose modelling. Under the supervision of the Scientific Council, headed by a coordinator designated by the SFRO and a co-coordinator designated by the SFPM, three leaders coordinate each axis: a radiation-oncologist, a medical physicist and a biologist, who are responsible for organizing a scientific meeting based on the consensus conference methodology to identify priority issues. The selected themes will be the basis for the establishment of a strategic research agenda and a roadmap to help coordinate national basic and translational research efforts in oncological radiotherapy. This work will be published and will be transmitted to the funding institutions and bodies with the aim of opening dedicated calls to finance the necessary human and technical resources. Structuration of a preclinical research network will allow coordinating the efforts of all the actors in the field and thus promoting innovation in radiotherapy.","364":null,"365":"Image-guided brachytherapy is crucial in the management of locally advanced cervical cancers and has benefited from advances in imaging over recent decades. The recommendations of the European Brachytherapy - European Society for Radiation Oncology (GEC-ESTRO) have resulted in harmonized practices and improved clinical outcomes in terms of efficacy and toxicity. Post-implant magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) has become the reference imaging modality to guide brachytherapy. There is an increasing interest for other multimodal imaging in these patients. The metabolic information provided by Positrons Emission Tomography\/computed tomodensitometry (PET\/CT) is also very promising approach to guide personalized dose escalation strategies. The prognostic values of MRI and PET scanner before brachytherapy make it possible to consider personalizing the dose delivered in brachytherapy and to propose a dose escalation to patients who really need it and to possibly consider a deescalation strategy in patients with a very good prognosis. However, further studies are needed to confirm this approach.","366":"The impact of curative radiotherapy depends mainly on the total dose delivered homogenously in the target volume. Tumor sensitivity to radiotherapy may be particularly inconstant depending on location, histology, somatic genetic parameters and the capacity of the immune system to infiltrate the tumor. In addition, the dose delivered to the surrounding healthy tissues may reduce the therapeutic ratio of many radiation treatments. In a same population treated in one center with the same technique, it appears that individual radiosensitivity clearly exists, namely in terms of late side effects that are in principle non-reversible. This review details the different radiobiological approaches that have been developed to better predict the tumor response but also the radiation-induced late effects.","367":"The risk of lymph node invasion, in case of prostate cancer, increases with the clinical stage of the disease, the Gleason score of prostate biopsies and the value of PSA at diagnosis. Historically, beyond 15% risk of lymph node involvement, irradiation of the pelvic areas was performed with prostate radiotherapy (RT) to take into account the risk of occult lymph node metastasis in patients at risk, but the benefit of this therapeutic approach remains to be demonstrated. The data from surgical lymph node dissection seem to question the risk levels, the escalation of the dose on the prostate increases the survival without relapse, the contribution of image-guided radiotherapy, (IGRT) and modulation of intensity (IMRT), decreases the toxicity of pelvic RT. This article reviews the principles of prophylactic ganglion irradiation for prostate cancer and discusses its relevance, current uncertainties, and prospective trials.","368":"Recent technological developments in linear accelerators (linacs) and their imaging systems have made it possible to routinely perform stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT) treatments. To ensure the security and quality of the treatments, national and international recommendations have been written. This review focuses on the recommendations of the report 91 of the International Commission on Radiation Units (ICRU) on stereotactic treatments with small photon beams and proposes to answer the question of the eligibility of the commercially available accelerators for the treatment of extra-cranial SRT (SBRT). The ICRU 91 report outlines important features needed to respect the constraints, which are high intensity photon beam, integrated image-guidance, high mechanical accuracy of the linac, multileaf collimator with reduced leaf width, bundled motion management and bundled 6 Dimensional \"robotic\" couch tabletop. Most of the contemporary linacs meet these recommendations, in particular, stereotactic dedicated linacs, or modern gantry-based linacs equipped with 3 dimensional cone-beam CT imaging and 2D-stereoscopic planar imaging. Commercially available ring-based linacs have some limitations: they offer only coplanar treatments, and couch movements are limited to translations and, some have limited imaging equipment and no ability to manage intrafraction motion. However, for performing SBRT, non-coplanar irradiations are not mandatory, contrarily to intracranial stereotactic irradiations. Furthermore, patients' rotations can be corrected, thanks to real-time adaptive radiotherapy available on MRI-linacs. Finally, significant improvements are expected in the short term to compensate the weaknesses of the current devices.","369":"The oligometastatic paradigm refers to an intermediate biologic state of cancer with restricted metastatic capacity. Its phenotype is characterized by a limited number of metastases and a slow tumor growth. Various clinical and pre-clinical studies associated this state to alterations of the biological mechanisms involved in metastatic diffusion. Eventually, this transitional state leads to a wide metastatic dissemination. However, there is a period during which the patient could benefit from local ablative treatment. Depending on several prognostic factors and the treatment provided, long survival or even healing can sometimes be achieved. The selection of patients eligible for such a curative strategy may be adapted following clinical, radiological or biological markers. Recent improvement of therapeutic and imaging are changing the clinical definition of oligometastatic cancer, which should be adapted to evidence from recent clinical and preclinical data.","370":"Prostate cancer is the most common cancer of men over 50 years old. Localized prostatic cancer treatment may be responsible of a decline of patient's quality of life. The main actors of treatment are now focused on minimizing functional consequences of treatments. The radiation oncologist has a central role in patient monitoring. The follow-up is codified by official recommendations of learned societies to enhance the post-cancer period. The main objective of this article is to review the recommendations for clinical and biological follow-up. An inventory of the functional consequences of the various treatments will be detailed, and particularly those caused by androgen deprivation therapy, with a review of precautions before implementation, adverse effects and their management, as well as monitoring recommendations. The analysis of quality of life after curative treatment and suggestions to improve monitoring will also be discussed.","371":"The selection of target volumes for head and neck cancer radiation therapy, particularly prophylactic volumes that reflect infra-clinic spreads, is a complex process. It is based on the knowledge of the natural history of these tumors and must take into consideration the special challenges due to the diversity and complexity of head and neck anatomy. The dosimetric and ballistic precision provided by modern radiation techniques has required strong strategic deliberation to ensure the relevance and reproducibility of target volumes. Specifically, regarding cervical lymph node volumes, two issues emerged. What lymph node area to select depending on the location and the staging of the primary tumor? How to convey that choice in the process of treatment planning and delivery? This debate has been progressively enriched over time resulting in the publication of several international guidelines to standardize the terminology of head and neck lymph node areas and to lay solid science-based foundations to drive practices. This abundance of information makes these guidelines complex, but their accurate understanding is required for adequate usage. We provide an overview of the main published recommendations for the selection of lymph node target volumes when treating oral cavity and pharyngo-laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma with radiation therapy.","372":"No recommandations have been established for reirradiation of brain metastases yet. The purpose of this review is to analyse the data of the five last years about the feasibility, efficacy and tolerance of reirradiation of brain metastases. Reirradiation can be 3D conformal or stereotactic. Whole brain irradiation seems appropriate for multiple brain metastases in order to obtain symptomatic relief, with or without supportive care. Stereotactic reirradiation has shown satisfying results in terms of overall survival, local control, without significant toxicity. Prospective trials are necessary in order to validate consensual recommandations.","373":"The increasing complexity of radiotherapy work situations (technological developments, dynamics of change, increased constraints, evolution of collective actions, of professions, of interfaces between people, of human-machine interfaces, etc.) and the limits of traditional FMEA method (Failure Mode and Effects Analysis) for analysing the risks incurred by radiotherapy patients generate difficulties in identifying how the work situations of a healthcare team can generate risky situations for patients. This observation has led us to develop a new method of risk analysis: the Work Complexity Sharing and Exploration Spaces (EPECT in French). The objective of this article is to better secure a care process (making practices more reliable, updating prescribed work, defining preventive and corrective measures, continuing reflections) based on an understanding of the complexity of radiotherapy work situations and a change in our way of thinking about risks.","374":"For the last decade, stereotactic body radiotherapy has become a leading treatment for localized prostate cancer. It can be delivered using a wide array of radiotherapy machines. However, although numerous clinical studies, both prospective and retrospective, have been published, the different techniques have never been properly compared. This article aims at giving an overview of the published trials, and at pointing out the major differences between the machines, from a clinical (efficacy end toxicity), technical and radiobiological point of view.","375":"The use of stereotactic body radiotherapy (SBRT) has increased rapidly over the past decade. Optimal preservation of normal tissues is a major issue because of their high sensitivity to high doses per session. Extreme hypofractionation can convert random errors into systematic errors. Optimal preservation of organs at risk requires first of all a rigorous implementation of this technique according to published guidelines. The robustness of the imaging modalities used for planning, and training medical and paramedical staff are an integral part of these guidelines too. The choice of SBRT indications, dose fractionation, dose heterogeneity, ballistics, are also means of optimizing the protection of normal tissues. Non-coplanarity and tracking of moving targets allow dosimetric improvement in some clinical settings. Automatic planning could also improve normal tissue protection. Adaptive SBRT, with new image guided radiotherapy modalities such as MRI, could further reduce the risk of toxicity.","376":"Liver stereotactic body radiotherapy is a developing technique for the treatment of primary tumours and metastases. Its implementation is complex because of the particularities of the treated organ and the comorbidities of the patients. However, this technique is a treatment opportunity for patients otherwise in therapeutic impasse. The scientific evidence of liver stereotactic body radiotherapy has been considered by the French health authority as insufficient for its widespread use outside specialized and experienced centers, despite a growing and important number of retrospective and prospective studies, but few comparative data. This article focuses on the specific features of stereotactic body radiotherapy for liver treatments and the results of published studies of liver stereotactic body radiotherapy performed with classic linear accelerators and dedicated radiosurgery units.","377":null,"378":"Fractionation was established more than fifty years ago as the best way to obtain a differential effect between tumors and normal tissues. However, new technologies allowed today to spare critical organs from the radiation fields. And so protracted courses of irradiation are no longer required. Hypofractionation have clear practical advantages over classical fractionation: it saves the patient time; it saves money for public health system; it reduces pressure on radiotherapy units. In several localization, it has proved to be as efficient as classical fractionation without increasing late effects. In prostate cancer, some radiobiological considerations argue in favor of a better efficiency, but clinical trials did not demonstrated differences in biological control. In conclusion, for all diseases where hypofractionation was demonstrated efficient, it must be fully implemented. Invoice procedures must be adapted to maintain a sufficient level of reimbursement of radiotherapy centers.","379":"PET\/CT has become a standard examination in oncology but is probably still underused for radiotherapy planning. However, except for the clinical research data that shows the interest of this examination in considering personalized and adaptive radiotherapy, it is also important in defining target volumes. However, before using it in clinical practice, a few prerequisites are required to know the acquisition and segmentation methods. Ideally, PET\/CT should become a standard examination for radiotherapy departments in the same way as planning CT and tomorrow as MRI.","380":"Adaptive radiotherapy (ART) is a complexe image-guided radiotherapy modality that comprises multiple planning to account for anatomical variations occurring during irradiation. Schematically, two strategies of RTA can be distinguished and combined according to tumor locations. One or more replanning can be proposed to correct systematic variations such as tumor shrinkage. A library of treatment plans with day-to-day plan selection from cone-beam CT imaging can also be proposed to correct random variations such as uterine motion or bladder\/rectum volume changes. Because of strong anatomical variations occurring during irradiation, RTA appears therefore particularly justified in head and neck, lung, bladder, cervical and rectum and pancreas tumors, and to a lesser extent for prostate tumors and other digestive tumors. For these tumor locations, ART provides a fairly clear dosimetric benefit but a clinical benefit not yet formally demonstrated. ART cannot be proposed in a routine practice but must be evaluated medico-economically in the context of prospective trials. A rigorous quality control must be associated.","381":null,"382":"Along with the surgeon, the gastroenterologist and the general practitioner, the radiation oncologist is involved in the follow-up of patients with rectal cancer treated by radiation. Post-treatment follow-up is recommended by major professional expert groups and consists of clinical examination, monitoring of carcinoembryonic antigen, colonoscopy and computed tomography of the abdomen and pelvis. Three recent large phase III randomized trials demonstrated a lack of survival benefit from intensive follow-up strategies in comparison with minimal follow-up. However, a follow-up program is not only important for the detection of an early disease relapse but it can be also used for the identification and the management of long-term toxicity and sequalae related to rectal cancer treatment.","383":"Post-therapeutic follow-up of patients with head and neck cancer involves numerous professionals. The radiation oncologist should play an active role in this process. His oncological knowledge and technical expertise position him as a cornerstone for the detection of recurrences from the treated tumor, the research of second primary cancers and the screening of potential side-effects induced by the different treatments administered. To improve the benefits\/costs ratio and allow good patient-compliance, follow-up programs should be built through close collaboration between the different contributors and planned according to a feasible schedule. Paraclinical exams must be arranged to respond to accurate objectives. Patient-education is essential to ensure the patient's full understanding and active participation. Finally, the transfer of the long-term follow-up of cancer survivors from specialists to primary care physicians is relevant but would require a prospective evaluation of its efficiency for this specific population.","384":"Literature review reporting results of salvage brachytherapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy for prostate recurrence only after radiotherapy for prostate cancer. A total of 38 studies (including at least 15 patients per study) were analysed: 19 using low-dose-rate brachytherapy, nine high-dose-rate brachytherapy and ten stereotactic body radiotherapy. Only five studies were prospective. The median numbers of patients were 30 for low-dose-rate brachytherapy, 34 for high-dose-rate brachytherapy, and 30 for stereotactic body radiotherapy. The median follow-up were 47months for low-dose-rate brachytherapy, 36months for high-dose-rate brachytherapy and 21months for stereotactic body radiotherapy. Late genitourinary toxicity rates ranged, for grade 2: from 4 to 42% for low-dose-rate brachytherapy, from 7 to 54% for high-dose-rate brachytherapy and from 3 to 20% for stereotactic body radiotherapy, and for grade 3 or above: from 0 to 24% for low-dose-rate brachytherapy, from 0 to 13% for high-dose-rate brachytherapy and from 0 to 3% for grade 3 or above (except 12% in one study) for stereotactic body radiotherapy. Late gastrointestinal toxicity rates ranged, for grade 2: from 0 to 6% for low-dose-rate brachytherapy, from 0 to 14% for high-dose-rate brachytherapy and from 0 to 11% for stereotactic body radiotherapy, and for grade 3 or above: from 0 to 6% for low-dose-rate brachytherapy, and from 0 to 1% for high-dose-rate brachytherapy and stereotactic body radiotherapy. The 5-year biochemical disease-free survival rates ranged from 20 to 77% for low-dose-rate brachytherapy and from 51 to 68% for high-dose-rate brachytherapy. The 2- and 3-year disease-free survival rates ranged from 40 to 82% for stereotactic body radiotherapy. Prognostic factors of biochemical recurrence have been identified. Despite a lack of prospective data, salvage reirradiation for prostate cancer recurrence can be proposed to highly selected patients and tumours. Prospective comparative studies are needed. ","385":"This article provides a proposal for the selection and delineation of clinical target volumes for the treatment with radiation of submandibular glands tumours. This article does not deal with external radiotherapy indications but specifies the volumes to be treated if radiotherapy is chosen. High-risk and low-risk peritumoral clinical target volumes are described based on the probability of local tumoral spread. High-risk and low-risk clinical target volumes are illustrated on CT-scan slices. A proposal for the selection of nodal clinical target volumeis also proposed.","386":"Management of resectable esophageal carcinoma is based on a multimodal treatment associating neo-adjuvant chemoradiation before surgery. This therapeutic sequence allows a disease-free survival rate at 2 years around 45% but remains associated with a high post-operative morbidity. In case of definitive chemoradiotherapy, the dose delivered to the macroscopic disease is a controversial topic since decades and the prognosis of patients treated in this setting at the dose of 50Gy remains poor. This article proposes a review of the main published data and the ongoing studies related to the management of these patients.","387":"Head and neck cancers comprise a variety of tumours depending on the sub-site, for which target volumes and the prescribed doses need to be individualized according to each patient's history and presentation. This article aims at describing the main factors involved in decision-making regarding dose and volume, as well as ongoing research. Contouring and treatment guidelines, use of altered fractionation, major prognostic factors, the role of Human papillomavirus and of functional imaging will be presented and discussed.","388":"In the last decade, major advances in high precision treatment delivery and multimodal imaging allowed radiotherapy to be more efficient and better tolerated. However, the technology of the accelerators used to generate X-ray beams is outdated and does not allow to explore the tolerance to novel approaches in terms of dose-rate. We have been the first to propose a completely novel modality of irradiation, named Flash radiotherapy, in which the dose per pulse and the instant dose-rate during the pulses is 103 to 104 higher than those used in conventional facilities. Flash has been shown to spare mouse lung from radio-induced fibrosis, whilst leaving unchanged the antitumor potential. Other teams have shown that the advantage of Flash in terms of reduced complications extends to normal brain and intestinal crypts. The goal of this paper is to review the progress of studies dealing with very high dose-rate \"Flash\" irradiation, describe the theoretical models proposed to explain the underlying mechanisms, and discuss the prospects for clinical applications of this emerging technique.","389":"The decision to reirradiate a volume which had been previously irradiated remains in 2019 one of the most difficult challenge for a radiation oncologist. Such a decision has to be based on a number of clinical and technological criteria, and the radiation oncologist will have to answer three main questions: i) can the patient clinically tolerate a second irradiation in the same previously irradiated area? While waiting for fully reliable individual tests of radiosensitivity, one has to take into account the tolerance of the first irradiation, as well as the comorbidities and\/or habits which could impact the patient intrinsic radiosensitivity; ii) do the technical data of the first radiotherapy allow a re-irradiation? Unfortunately, and essentially when the discussion of re-irradiating the patient occurs many years (or even decades) after the first treatment, those precise technical data can be missing; iii) which technique should be used for the re-irradiation? In such a specific situation, the patient should be offered the more precise modern technology: stereotactic radiotherapy, protons, brachytherapy (low-, high-, or pulsed-dose rate). The indisputable improvement of the ballistic precision linked to our new technologies should lead to refine and to develop the indications of re-irradiation in the next future.","390":"Nowadays, ionizing radiations have numerous applications, especially in medicine for diagnosis and therapy. Pharmacological radioprotection aims at increasing detoxification of free radicals. Radiomitigation aims at improving survival and proliferation of damaged cells. Both strategies are essential research area, as non-contained radiation can lead to harmful effects. Some advances allowing the comprehension of normal tissue injury mechanisms, and the discovery of related predictive biomarkers, have led to developing several highly promising radioprotector or radiomitigator drugs. Next to these drugs, a growing interest does exist for biotherapy in this field, including gene therapy and cell therapy through mesenchymal stem cells. In this review article, we provide an overview of the management of radiation damages to healthy tissues via gene or cell therapy in the context of radiotherapy. The early management aims at preventing the occurrence of these damages before exposure or just after exposure. The late management offers promises in the reversion of constituted late damages following irradiation.","391":"When localized, the reference treatment of urothelial, muscle-invasive bladder tumours relies on radical cystectomy with reconstruction by enterocystoplasty if possible or Bricker bypass. Trimodal therapy combining transurethral resection of the tumour followed by concomitant chemotherapy may be considered as a therapeutic alternative to radical cystectomy in well-selected patients with unifocal tumours, stage T2, non-diverticular location, without in situ carcinoma or hydronephrosis and with macroscopically complete transurethral resection. The functional prognosis of the bladder and quality of life should be discussed with the patient as well as the need for salvage surgery for persistent tumour at a 45-Gy dose level, the latter being a highly unfavourable prognosis factor. On the other hand, this trimodal treatment is the reference in case of surgical contraindication. This article details the methods and results of the main series available in the literature in terms of local control, survival, bladder preservation rates and complications, as well as study prospects.","392":"Randomized trials demonstrated similar overall survival between mastectomy and breast-conservative surgery followed by adjuvant radiation therapy. Breast-conservative surgery, with adjuvant radiation therapy, with or without neoadjuvant systemic therapy has become the standard of care for women with early or locally advanced breast cancer. Nevertheless, certain cardiac, lung or cutaneous toxicities may alter the long-term body image and the quality of life of a limited number of patients who consider having had \"overtreatment\" or treatment outside the best knowledge of science. In case of low-risk breast cancer, several trials have evaluated the carcinologic outcome in absence of radiation therapy after breast-conservative surgery. Local recurrences increased in case of breast-conservative surgery alone but without impact on overall survival. Multiple debates have emerged in order to select the most appropriate evaluation criteria. Finally, a large consensus has considered that reducing local recurrences is important but with modern technologies and after identifying patients of individual radiosensitivity. Indeed, in case of a low absolute risk of local recurrence, radiation therapy techniques have been developed to allow a focal treatment especially for patients with high risk of developing late effects. This kind of compromise takes into account the reduction risk of local recurrences but also the probability of developing radiation-induced cutaneous sequelae. In the same way, for patients considered at high risk of recurrence, the huge volumes need specific techniques to better cover the targets while protecting the surrounding critic organs such as heart and lung. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy and the local high boost may help to decrease local recurrences of these more extended and aggressive diseases while considering the individual radiosensitivity that paves the way of long-term sequelae. In this article, we detail a personalized approach of breast radiation therapy considering the absolute risk of local recurrences and the probability of radiation-induced toxicity appearance.","393":"Brachytherapy can be used for the treatment of every localized prostate cancer, notably as boost for intermediate- and high-risk prostate cancer. With the incidence of prostate cancer increasing significantly during the next decades and brachytherapy developing, we conducted a descriptive survey to analyse the current status of prostate brachytherapy in France to see if the future demands could be met. All radiotherapy centres that declared providing brachytherapy were found from the French national institute of cancer registry and they were asked to reply to an online form in April 2018. Fifty-two of the 54-brachytherapy centres (96%) replied the form and 34 centres did prostate brachytherapy. Among those centres, 32 performed iodine 125 low-dose rate brachytherapy as monotherapy, 19 provided brachytherapy boost (eight centres low-dose rate 125I; seven centres high-dose rate; four centres both). Among the centres not performing brachytherapy boost, 18 wanted to do, eight did not want and nine did not reply. The main reasons for reluctance towards brachytherapy boost were: organization constraints (three centres), refer patients to a nearby brachytherapy centre (one centre), technical issues (two centres) and lack of strong scientific evidences (two centres). In terms of human resources, the mean number of trained physicians and physicists were two (range: 1-6) and three (range: 1-5) respectively. In France, the future needs for prostate brachytherapy cannot be met by the current health supply. Health authorities should firstly reimburse brachytherapy boost and redefine an optimal training and organization of centres such that every patient with prostate cancer can receive optimal treatment. ","394":null,"395":"The purpose of this study was to describe the adjuvant management of high grade uterine sarcoma and highlight prognostic factors for overall survival and progression-free survival. Between 01\/2000 and 01\/2015, 91 patients undergoing surgery were presented at the multidisciplinary team meeting of our institution. The type of surgery, the anatomopathological features, adjuvant treatments, dates and sites of recurrence were collected. The prognostic value of the various factors was evaluated with the multivariate Cox model. A total of 50 women with uterine sarcoma were identified and lesions included 43 leiomyosarcomas (86%) and seven high grade sarcomas (14%). Eighteen patients received adjuvant pelvic radiotherapy (36%) and six adjuvant systemic therapy (12%). The median follow-up time was 63 months. Thirty-nine patients (78%) had a recurrence: 22 had only metastatic recurrence (58%), two had isolated pelvic recurrence (5%) and 15 had pelvic and metastatic recurrence (38%). Adjuvant radiotherapy was associated with survival without pelvic recurrence in univariate analysis (P=0.005, hazard ratio [HR]=0.15); age greater than 55 years and adjuvant radiotherapy were associated with metastatic free survival in multivariate analysis (P=0.015, HR=2.37, and P=0.013, HR=0.41 respectively) CONCLUSION: According to the results of our series, there is a benefit of radiotherapy after surgery in terms of local control of uterine sarcoma. It is necessary to identify the subgroup of patients who will benefit from an adjuvant radiotherapy in order to provide them with more optimal care. ","396":"Anaplastic lymphoma kinase (ALK)-positive non-small cell lung cancer (3 to 5% of all non-small cell lung cancers) carries a particularly high risk of central nervous system dissemination (60% to 90%). As the use of ALK inhibitors improves treatment outcomes over chemotherapy, the determent of central nervous system metastases has become an increasingly relevant therapeutic dilemma considering young age and possible extended overall survival. The goal of brain metastases management is to optimize both overall survival and quality of life, with the high priority of neurocognitive function preservation. Unfortunately in the first year on crizotinib, the pioneering ALK inhibitors, approximately one third of these patients fail in the central nervous system, which is explained by an inadequate central nervous system drug penetration through the blood-brain barrier. Central nervous system-directed radiotherapy represents the most important strategy to control intracranial disease burden and extend the survival benefit with crizotinib. The role of whole brain irradiation in the treatment of brain metastases diminishes, as this technique is associated with the risk of neurocognitive decline. Stereotactic radiotherapy represents an alternative technique that delivers ablative doses of ionizing radiation to the limited volume of oligometastatic brain disease, offering sparing of the adjacent brain parenchyma and reduced neurotoxicity. The next generation ALK inhibitors were designed to cross the blood-brain barrier more efficiently than crizotinib and achieve higher concentration in the cerebrospinal fluid, offering prominent ability to control central nervous system spread. In the phase III ALEX trial the intracranial control was significantly better with alectinib as compared to crizotinib and it translated into survival benefit. Other next generation ALK inhibitors (i.e. ceritinib, brigatinib, lorlatinib) also demonstrated promising activity in the central nervous system.","397":null,"398":"Lung and some digestive tumours move during a respiratory cycle. Four-dimensional scanography (4D-CT) is commonly used in treatment planning to account for respiratory motion. Although many French radiotherapy centres are now equipped, there are no guidelines on this subject to date. We wanted to draw up a description of the use of the 4D-CT for the treatment planning in France. We conducted a survey in all French radiotherapy centres between March and April 2017. One hundred and seventy-two were contacted. The participation rate was 88.37%. The use of the 4D-CT seems to be common and concerned planning for 15.28% of kidney and adrenal cancers, 19.72% of pancreatic cancers, 27.78% of oesophageal cancers and 73.24% of lung cancers in case of normofractionated treatments. The use of the 4D-CT was also widespread in the case of stereotactic body radiation therapy: with 61.11% in the case of pulmonary irradiation and 34.72% in the case of hepatic irradiation. Many centres declared they carried out several 4D-CT for treatment planning (29, 55% in case of stereotactic body radiation therapy for lung tumours and 20% for liver tumours). Private centres tend to repeat 4D-CT more. Although the use of the 4D-CT appears to be developing, it remains very heterogeneous. To date, the repetition of the 4D-CT has been very poorly studied and could be the subject of clinical studies, allowing to define in which indications and for which populations there is a real benefit. ","399":"Radiotherapy is a treatment method performed using ionizing radiation on cancer patients either alone or with surgery and\/or chemotherapy. Although modern radiotherapy techniques provide a significant advantage in protecting healthy tissues, it is inevitable that normal tissues are also located in the areas targeted by radiations. In this study, we aimed to examine the bone mineral density changes in bone structures commonly included in the irradiated area such as, L5 vertebra, sacrum, and femur heads, in patients who have received pelvic radiotherapy; and the relationship between these changes with radiation dose. Patients included in the study had been previously diagnosed with rectal cancer, which were operated or not. Preoperative or postoperative pelvic radiotherapy was planned for all patients. In terms of convenience when comparing with future scans, all densitometry and CT scans were performed with the same devices. Fifteen patients were included in the study. In order to determine the dose of radiation each identified area had taken after radiotherapy, the sacrum, L5 vertebra, bilateral femoral heads, and L1 regions were contoured in the CT scans in which treatment planning was done. Sagittal cross-sectional images were taken advantage of while these regions were being contoured. Bone mineral density was evaluated with CT and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry before and after the treatment. The regions that have theoretically been exposed to irradiation, such as L5, sacrum, left to right femur were found to have significant difference in terms of bone density. According to CT evaluation, there was a significant decrease in bone intensity of L5, sacrum, left and right femurs. Dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry assessment revealed that the whole of the left femoral head, left femur neck and Ward's region were significantly affected by radiotherapy. However, there was no significant difference in the sacrum and L5 vertebra before and after radiotherapy. More accurate results could be achieved if the same study was conducted on a larger patient population, with a longer follow-up period. When the reduction in bone density is at maximum or a cure is likely in a long-term period, bone mineral density could be determined by measurements performed at regular intervals. ","400":"The main goal of palliative radiotherapy is to reduce patient's discomfort. But sometimes patients do not receive any benefits from this treatment because of rapid worsening of their general condition. This prospective monocentric study assessed the effective delivery of palliative radiotherapy. From 1st December 2015 to 29th February 2016, all consecutive patients receiving palliative radiotherapy in our hospital were included. The primary endpoint was the effective delivery of palliative radiotherapy according to the initial prescription (total dose, overall treatment time and fractionation). The secondary endpoints were the number of treatment breaks, the clinical benefit, the number of deaths and the delays for admission in the palliative care unit. Fifty-nine patients were included and 64 treatments were analysed. The treatment sites were: bone (70.3%) and brain (21.9%). The treatment goals were: pain control only (43.8%), decompression only (21.9%), pain control and decompression (32.8%), haemostatic aim (1.6%). Palliative treatment was achieved in 57 cases (89%). Temporary interruption of the radiotherapy treatment was necessary in six cases (9.4%; three for medical reason, three for logistic reason). The main reason of permanent interruption was worsening of performance status (seven cases). Palliation of symptoms (complete or partial responses) was obtained in 44 cases (68.8%). Seven patients (11.9%) died during the month after the end of the treatment. No delay or cancellation for admission in the palliative care unit were observed. Palliative radiotherapy was completed as originally planned in 51 cases (79.9%) with a clinical benefit for 44 cases (68.8%).

In a phase III trial (UNIRAD protocol), she received everolimus 5 months after radiation therapy. Seven days after introduction, she was suffering from a radiation recall syndrome with exacerbation skin reactions. The exact pathophysiological mechanism of radiation recall syndrome is unknown.

Indeed, MRI offers superior soft tissue contrast compared to computerized tomography (CT) and therefore could provide a better delineation of target volumes and organs at risk than CT for radiotherapy. Furthermore, an MRI-only radiotherapy workflow would suppress registration errors inherent to the registration of MRI with CT. However, the estimation of the electronic density of tissues using MRI images is still a challenging issue. The purpose of this work was to design and evaluate a pseudo-CT generation method for prostate cancer treatments. A pseudo-CT was generated for ten prostate cancer patients using an elastic deformation based method. For each patient, dose delivered to the patient was calculated using both the planning CT and the pseudo-CT. Dose differences between CT and pseudo-CT were investigated. Mean dose relative difference in the planning target volume is 0.9% on average and ranges from 0.1% to 1.7%. In organs at risks, this value is 1.8%, 0.8%, 0.8% and 1% on average in the rectum, the right and left femoral heads, and the bladder respectively. The dose calculated using the pseudo-CT is very close to the dose calculated using the CT for both organs at risk and PTV. These results confirm that pseudo-CT images generated using the proposed method could be used to calculate radiotherapy treatment doses on MRI images. ","410":"Radiation oncology departments are paradigmatic examples of the general evolution of medicine towards an ever more important presence of technology. The distance to the body or our radical dependence on the machine are concrete factors conditioning care practices in radiotherapy. Thus, an essential question appears: can technique be seen as a real limit for our primary function of care in radiation oncology? It is also necessary to consider the postures this question could lead to: the real risk of finding legitimacy in our sole function of technicians. If technique can be seen as a possible hindrance to our care role, it also appears that technique can create unexpected spaces, where radiation oncologists can express their own definition of care with patients. It is time for our community to take into account this specific aspect of the technologic issue in order to attest the reality of its limits and possibilities. A collective reflection on the ethics of technique, and more broadly on the ethics of care practices in radiation oncology appears relevant.","411":"Hodgkin lymphoma is a highly curable malignancy involving lymph nodes and the lymphatic system. Even at late stage disease, about 70% of patients will be cured with standard first line therapy. For patients who experience relapse or refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma, the standard treatment option is high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue or transplant. However about 50% of patients will have recurrence after high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue or transplantation and have worse prognosis with median overall survival of 32% at 5 years. The anti-PD1 checkpoints inhibitors pembrolizumab and nivolumab have remarkably improved outcomes of patients with relapse of refractory classical Hodgkin lymphoma after high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue or transplantation. On the other hand, radiotherapy is an entire component of salvage therapy and its efficacy is now well established in term of local disease control in sites of relapsed or refractory Hodkin lymphoma. Defining the optimal modality and timing of radiotherapy as these new agents arrive is a challenge. An interesting approach is the combination of radiotherapy with checkpoint inhibitor and the possibility of stopping the treatment when complete response is achieved. We add to the literature two new cases of combination of radiotherapy with immunotherapy in patients who relapsed after high-dose chemotherapy followed by autologous stem cell rescue or transplantation and consolidation with brentuximab vedotin, resulting in excellent outcomes.","412":null,"413":null,"414":null,"415":"To quantitatively and qualitatively evaluate and compare MR images acquired from the usual diagnostic set-up with images acquired in a radiotherapy set-up. MR images of a phantom and 18 prostate cancer patients imaging using the usual diagnostic set-up with a curved tabletop (DX-set-up) and using a radiotherapy set-up (RT-set-up) with a flat tabletop, were analysed retrospectively. Quantitative assessments were made by measuring signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) and contrast to noise ratio (CNR). Non-parametric tests were used. Qualitative assessments were made independently by three radiologists. Inter-rater reliability was measured as the percentage of agreement and Gwet's AC2 test. The use of the RT-set-up was linked to 19.3% SNR drop on the phantom image. Up to 24% SNR prostate drop was observed in patients' images. Up to 34% CNR drop was observed in patients' images. Although image quality of the RT-set-up was acceptable, all measured domains were worse than the corresponding DX-set-up. Additionally diagnostic images were linked to a better percentage of agreement among raters. SNR, CNR and image quality were significantly worse when using the RT-set-up than with the DX-set-up although Image quality in the RT-set-up was acceptable.

Esophageal fistulas often require additional procedures and are associated with a high mortality rate. The present study was conducted to determine the risk factors associated with esophageal fistulas in patients with esophageal cancer. We reviewed the cases of 206 patients who were treated with definitive radiotherapy for esophageal cancer. The planning dose, which ranged from 44 to 64.8Gy (median: 59.4Gy), was delivered to the primary lesion and regional lymph nodes. Descriptive statistics were calculated, and time-to-event analyses were performed using Cox proportional hazards regression analysis. None of the 68 patients with T1 or T2 esophageal cancer developed esophageal fistulas. Among the 138 patients with T3 or T4 esophageal cancer, esophageal fistulas were detected in 20 (14.5%) patients. Multivariate analysis of the 138 patients with T3 or T4 esophageal cancer revealed low body mass index (BMI) to be an independent risk factor for esophageal fistula formation (P=0.0055). The optimal BMI cut-off value for predicting esophageal fistula formation was 20 kg\/m2 (P=0.0121, odds ratio=4.130). In patients with esophageal cancer treated with definitive radiotherapy, a BMI below20kg\/m2 is a risk factor for esophageal fistula formation. A well-designed randomized controlled trial comparing the incidence of esophageal fistulas between patients with esophageal cancer who do and do not receive nutritional support before radiotherapy is required. ","418":"While the prognosis of metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer has shown significant progress these last years, notably with the discovery of oncogen-driven subtypes and the development of targeted therapies, significant improvements are still needed. More recently, numerous authors studied the oligo-metastasis concept, where the metastasis are limited in number and sites involved, and that could benefit from an aggressive approach of these lesions, for instance with the help of stereotactic radiotherapy. Nevertheless, there is no clear consensus existing for the time being for the treatment of these tumors. Three main clinical situations can be distinguished: oligo-metastasis state de novo at diagnosis (synchronous) or as first metastatic event of an initially locally limited affection (metachronous); oligo-progression during systemic treatment of a pluri-metastatic disease; and finally oligo-persistence of some remaining metastatic lesions at the nadir of the systemic therapy effect. In this review, we will discuss the place of stereotactic radiotherapy in the treatment of non-small-cell oligo-metastatic oncogene-addicted cancers treated with targeted therapies, differentiating these three main clinical situations. In all these indications, this technique could provide a benefit in terms of local control, possibly even in specific survival, when associated with targeted therapy continuation, related to local control of the oligo-metastatic cerebral or extracerebral lesions.","419":null,"420":"Nasosinusal mucoceles, although benign, are aggressive and sometimes destructive lesions.

In the following years, this value has been confirmed by a large series of papers, so that this very low alpha\/beta ratio became a \"dogma\", on which a large number of hypofractionated schemes were being built. This was logical, since this very low value strongly suggested a beneficial advantage of hypofractionation for prostate cancer. However, more recently, several questions arose; first, a number of authors reported, from the analysis of their own data, values of alpha\/beta ratio which were higher than the \"dogma\". Secondly, the three modern \"superiority trials\", aiming at demonstrating the advantages of hypofractionated schemes, actually failed to show such a superiority, in spite of high equivalent doses (calculated with an alpha\/beta of 1.5Gy), reaching up to 84 - 90Gy. In 2018, three review papers\/metanalyses shed a new light on what could be the value of the alpha\/beta ratio for prostate cancer. In particular, those studies took into account a \"time factor\" (for repopulation), a parameter which had been either forgotten or underestimated before. In those three studies, the alpha\/beta ratio was ranging from 2.7Gy to 4.9Gy. Those data do confirm the sensitivity to the fraction dose variation of prostate cancer, but this sensitivity could be lower than suggested by an alpha\/beta ratio of 1.5Gy.","422":"The four-dimensional scannography, also called 4D-CT, was created in the early 2000s. This method enables the aquistion of CT-scans synchronised with the patient's breathing. It allows an anatomical observation depending on the time. Different systems have been marketed. They are commonly used in treatment planning. It allows to take into account respiratory motion, considering the changes of shape and position of the tumor and organs. In the age of new techniques and stereotactic irradiations, 4D-CT is a valuable tool for estimating the uncertainties associated with respiratory movements, This technique also presents some limitations, including artifacts. The quality of the examination can be degraded in some patients with irregular respiration. Here we propose a summary of this technique detailing its principle of operation, its advantages and its main limits.","423":null,"424":"Medulloblastoma is the most common primary malignant central nervous system tumour in children.

These results are compared with those from other centres reported in literature. This was a retrospective study conducted at Xhinhua Hospital in Shanghai, China. It included 121 patients treated for medulloblastoma from 1993 to December 2013. Mean age at diagnosis was 6.7 years (range: 1-14.3 years). Total surgical resection was achieved in 60% of the cases. Classic medulloblastoma was found in 59% of the cases. Adjuvant radiotherapy was delivered in all cases and chemotherapy concerned 70.2% of the studied cohort. The median follow-up time of the study was 84 months (range: 24-120 months). Five- and 10 years progression-free survival rates were 83.2%, and 69.5% and 5 years and 10 years. Overall survival rates were 82.5%, and 72.5%. Patient's age significantly influenced survival: patients under 3 years old had the worse outcomes (P=0.01). T and M stages also significantly impacted survival rates: advanced stages were associated with lower rates (P=0.08 and 0.05 respectively). Finally, patients receiving temezolomide had bad outcomes when compared to the new standard protocol used in the department (P=0.03). The most commonly reported late toxicity was growth suppression in 35 patients (52.2%). Hypothyroidism requiring hormone replacement was recorded in 29% of the cases.

We studied 248 consecutive female patients with early stage breast cancer treated by conservative surgery followed by three-dimensional conformal whole breast irradiation in the isocentric lateral decubitus position between January 2013 and February 2014. Radiotherapy was performed on linear accelerators using a Varian. The energy used was 4 and 10MV photons or 6MV photons. All patients were evaluated weekly by the radiation oncologist, acute toxicity was assessed using the NCICTC v 3.0 scale. Late toxicity and cosmetic results were evaluated 18 months after the radiotherapy. Cosmetic results were defined as excellent, good, middle or bad. Among the 248 women included, the median age was 67 years (range: 35-91 years). All received whole breast radiotherapy with boost in 144 patients (58%). One-hundred-twenty patients received normofractionated and 124 patients hypofractionated whole breast radiotherapy. Median follow-up was 18 months. Acute skin toxicity in the whole breast radiotherapy in the isocentric lateral decubitus position was acceptable: there was 47% of grade 1 radiodermatitis, 50% of grade 2 and 3% grade 3 and no grade 4 for normofractionated radiotherapy; 89% of grade 1 dermatitis and 11% of grade 2 for hypofractionated radiotherapy; 89.7% of grade 0-1 dermatitis and 10.3% of grade 2 for the \"flash\" scheme and did not differ between the three linear accelerators (P=0.2, P=0.9 and P=0.2 respectively for the normofractionated radiotherapy, hypofractionated radiotherapy and the \"flash\"scheme).

Only a few studies have investigated rotational intensity-modulated radiotherapy with deep inspiration breath hold. We conducted a dosimetric study comparing rotational intensity-modulated radiotherapy in free breathing with deep inspiration breath hold for irradiation of left breast cancer and locoregional lymph nodes. Doses to organs at risk were compared, as well as doses to coronary arteries, left anterior descending coronary artery region, and aortic valve. The data from nine patients were included in the study. Treatment plans were comparable for target volumes. The deep inspiration breath hold delivery technique, compared with free breathing, reduced radiation dose to the heart (mean dose 4.8Gy vs. 6.6Gy, p=0.008; dose in 2% of the volume 16.8Gy vs. 23.3Gy, p=0.008; volume receiving 25Gy 0.8% vs. 2,2%, p=0.008; volume receiving 30Gy 0.4% vs. 1.2%, p=0.009), as well as to the right coronary artery (mean dose 6Gy vs. 8.9Gy, p=0.028), to the left anterior descending artery (mean dose 9.6Gy vs. 14.6Gy, p=0.021), to the left anterior descending coronary artery region (dose in 2% of the volume 17.4Gy vs. 24.6Gy, p=0.021), and to the aortic valve (mean dose 4.8Gy vs. 7Gy, p=0.028). Other doses to organs at risk were similar.

Patient (age, sex, diabetes, osteoporosis), tumour (planning target volume, volume of the overlapping region between planning target volume and chest wall) and chest wall dosimetric parameters (volumes receiving at least 30, 40, and 50Gy, the minimal doses received by the highest irradiated 1, 2, and 5cm3, and maximum dose) were collected. The correlation between chest wall pain (grade 2 or higher) and the different parameters was evaluated using univariate and multivariate logistic regression. Median follow-up was 18 months (range: 6-56 months). Twelve patients out of 122 developed chest wall pain of any grade (seven with grade 1, three with grade 2 and two with grade 3 pain). In univariate analysis, only the volume receiving 30Gy or more (P=0.034) and the volume of the overlapping region between the planning target volume and chest wall (P=0.038) significantly predicted chest wall pain, but these variables were later proved non-significant in multivariate regression. Our analysis could not find any correlation between the studied parameters and chest wall pain.

Cases of local recurrences presented a significantly lower distant metastasis rate (P&lt;0.001) and had a significantly longer overall survival compared to patients with regional lymph node recurrence (P&lt;0.001). However, multivariate Cox regression analysis showed that the site of recurrence had no significant impact on overall survival (P=0.14).

","436":null,"437":"A review of the literature has been conducted to better understand the effect of stereotactic radiotherapy on tumour vascularization and their consequences. High irradiation doses cause the death of endothelial cells by apoptosis through the ceramide pathway. Vascular consequences are multiple: increased permeability, decreased blood flow, increased hypoxia and tumoral necrosis. This necrosis causes an indirect death of the cancer cells in the days following the irradiation. The importance of indirect cell death in tumour control remains controversial, but it can explain the good clinical results of stereotactic radiotherapy. Stereotactic radiotherapy is a treatment of the tumour microenvironment. Tumour recurrence in this hypoxic environment is slower through disturbance of revascularization mechanisms but also more aggressive, with increased resistance to treatment and a higher risk of metastasis. In a longer time, vascular damage leads to chronic inflammation and a dysfunctional healing process resulting in vascular occlusion. This phenomenon is used in the treatment of arteriovenous malformations but is also responsible for damage to healthy tissues responsible for chronic complications. This is why high-dose irradiation can only be delivered using stereotactic radiotherapy, which reduces the irradiated volume.","438":"Whereas immune checkpoint inhibitors of serine\/threonine protein kinase B-raf therapy dramatically changed metastatic outcomes of patients with melanoma, they remain at high risk of brain extension.

Preoperative chemoradiation improves the locoregional control and overall survival after surgery for locally advanced oesophageal cancer. Definitive chemoradiation can also be proposed for non-resectable tumours or medically inoperable patients. Besides, definitive chemoradiation is considered as an alternative option to surgery for locally advanced squamous cell carcinomas. Chemotherapy regimen associated to radiotherapy consists of a combination of platinum derived drugs (cisplatinum or oxaliplatin) and 5-fluorouracil or a weekly scheme combination of carboplatin and paclitaxel according to CROSS protocol in a neoadjuvant strategy. Radiation doses vary from 41.4Gy to 45Gy for a preoperative strategy or 50 to 50.4Gy for a definitive treatment. The high risk of lymphatic spread due to anatomical features could justify the use of an elective nodal irradiation when the estimated risk of microscopic involvement is higher than 15% to 20%. An appropriate delineation of the gross tumour volume requires an exhaustive and up-to-date evaluation of the disease.

All eleven radiotherapy centres in the Nord and Pas-de-Calais departments of France participated. The localizations assessed to date included prostate, head and neck, breast and brain cancers. For each localization, the junior or senior physician(s) in charge of pathology delineated the volumes of interest according to their usual practices. Validated indices, including the Dice similarity coefficient, were used to quantify the delineation differences. The anonymized results were presented at two to three annual meetings. A second delineation of the clinical cases was then carried out to quantify homogenization. An evaluation of dosimetry practices was also conducted for prostate cancer. Wilcoxon assay matched data were used. Our work showed either satisfactory delineation concordance after the initial assessment or improved delineation concordance. For prostate cancer, the Dice similarity coefficient values were greater than 0.6 initially in two of the three clinical cases. For head and neck cancers, a statistically significant improvement was observed for only one of the clinical target volumes. More than half of the Dice similarity coefficient values were greater than 0.6 in the first comparison. The study of clinical cases of breast cancer allowed a homogenization of the delineation of five of the six lymph node clinical target volumes.

From 2004 to 2015, 744 patients were treated for rectal cancer, and ten had a histologic type other than adenocarcinoma. The median age was 60.7 years (range: 34.6-80.4 years). Histologic types were neuroendocrine (four), adenosquamous (one), undifferentiated with large cell (one), clear cell (one), anaplastic with small cell (one), signet ring cell (one) and adenocarcinoma with choriocarcinomatous differentiation (one). Four patients were initially diagnosed with a stage IV rectal cancer, and two ultimately became metastatic. Six patients underwent surgery, with four neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapies. None experienced complete response and two had incomplete resections. First-line and concomitant chemotherapies were adapted to histology results, mainly with etoposide and platinum salts for neuroendocrine and small cells tumours. Four patients experienced progression before first line treatments were achieved. Median progression free survival and overall survival were 3.8 and 10.1 months respectively. Two patients were long survivors (22 and 54.7 months, both still alive). All other died of rectal cancer. The present study highlights the rarity and the specificities of uncommon histologic types of rectal cancer. We report the real-life management and outcome of rare histologic types of rectal cancers, with dismal prognosis of stage IV tumours. We also report that treatments were adapted to histology. ","457":"To evaluate the feasibility and response to radiotherapy for improving the symptoms and quality of life in patients with pancreatic cancer. We enrolled 31 eligible patients (20 men, 11 women) with pancreatic cancer who were receiving radiotherapy from February 2012 to February 2014. The prescribed dose was 40 to 42Gy delivered to the planning target volume in seven to ten fractions of 4 to 6Gy. Patients completed Brief Pain Inventory (BPI), Functional Assessment Of Cancer Therapy-Hepatobiliary (FACT-Hep), and European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Quality Of Life Questionnaire C30 (EORTC QLQ-C30) one week prior to radiotherapy, and one and three months after treatment. The main outcome was the evaluation of the proportion of patients with less pain and reduced clinical symptoms after one month of radiotherapy compared to before treatment according to the BPI, FACT-Hep and EORTC QLQ-C30 scales. Of 31 patients, 28 completed the questionnaires. According to BPI evaluation, symptoms were improved in 57% of patients; the FACT-General (FACT-G) and liver function subscales revealed that there was symptom improvement in 89% and 7.1% of patients, respectively. Six items in the EORTC QLQ-C30 were improved. Following treatment, pain and clinical symptoms were improved in a considerable proportion of patients with pancreatic cancer, proving that palliative radiotherapy is feasible for pancreatic cancer. ","458":"In 2008, the French national society of radiation oncology (SFRO) and the association for radiation oncology continued education (AFCOR) created Siriade, an e-learning website dedicated to contouring. Between 2015 and 2017, this platform was updated using the latest digital online tools available. Two main sections were needed: a theoretical part and another section of online workshops. Teaching courses are available as online commented videos, available on demand. The practical section of the website is an online contouring workshop that automatically generates a report quantifying the quality of the user's delineation compared with the experts'. Siriade 2.0 is an innovating digital tool for radiation oncology initial and continuous education.

Medical files of all consecutive patients treated between 2004 and 2017 with external beam radiotherapy and\/or brachytherapy for IB1 cervical cancer, whatever the lymph node status, were retrospectively reviewed. Forty-two patients were included, with a median age of 49.8 years old. Median tumour size, estimated with the initial pelvic magnetic resonance imaging, was 26mm (interquartile range [IQR]=19.5-35). Histological types were mainly squamous cell carcinoma (59.5%) and adenocarcinoma (33.3%). Lymphovascular invasion was reported for 38.1% of patients. Pelvic lymph nodes were involved for eight patients (19.0%). Surgery was performed for 39 patients (92.9%). A neoadjuvant treatment was delivered for 20 patients (47.6%), an adjuvant treatment for 19 patients (45.2%) and an exclusive radiotherapy (with or without chemotherapy) followed by brachytherapy for three patients (7.1%). Pathologic complete response was achieved in 61.5% of patients. With a median follow-up of 5.8 years (IQR=2.6-9.4), five patients (11.9%) experienced a tumour relapse. The five-year disease-free survival was 79.5% (95% confident interval [CI]=66.9-94.4), the five-year overall survival was 87.8% (95% CI=77.2-99.8), and the five-year disease-specific survival was 94.2% (95% CI=86.7-100). In current clinical practice, tailored treatments are delivered, and seems to give correct therapeutic index. However, clinical trials are needed to standardise treatment according to patient characteristics and recurrence risk factors. ","461":null,"462":"We aimed to evaluate therapeutic results of radiotherapy for gastric mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. We reviewed retrospectively the records of 11 patients presenting with gastric MALT lymphoma treated between 1993 and 2014. Patients with low-grade lymphoma in failure after helicobacter eradication had exclusive gastric external radiotherapy. Chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy were indicated in case of high grade lymphoma. Radiotherapy doses range between 30 and 40Gy (2Gy per fraction, five fractions per week). All tumours were IE stage. Seven patients with low-grade lymphoma had radiotherapy. Four patients with high-grade lymphoma received chemotherapy then radiotherapy. Ten patients are in complete remission after treatment achievement. Five and 10 years disease-free survival are 100%. No severe toxicity was seen. Eradication of Helicobacter pylori is the mainstay of treatment of gastric MALT. External irradiation is an effective and well-tolerated treatment modality in case of resistance to helicobacter eradication.

The dates and times of contouring clinical target volumes and organs at risk were recorded by a senior and by two junior radiation oncologists. Outcome measurements were contour times and the time from start to approval. The factors evaluated were patient age, type of surgery, radiation targets and setup, operator, planning station, part of the day and day of the week on which the contouring started. The Welch test was used to comparatively assess the measurements. Two hundred and three cases were included in the analysis. The mean contour time per patient was 34minutes for a mean of 4.72 structures, with a mean of 7.1minutes per structure. The clinical target volume and organs at risk times did not differ significantly. The mean time from start to approval per patient was 29.4hours. Factors significantly associated with longer contour times were breast-conserving surgery (P=0.026), prone setup (P=0.002), junior operator (P&lt;0.0001), Pinnacle planning station (P=0.026), contouring start in the morning (P=0.001), and contouring start by the end of the week (P&lt;0.0001). Factors significantly associated with time from start to approval were age (P=0.038), junior operator (P&lt;0.0001), planning station (P=0.016), and contouring start by the end of the week (P=0.004). Contouring is a time-consuming process. Each delineated structure influences worktime, and many factors may be targeted for optimization of the workflow. These preliminary data will serve as basis for future prospective studies to determine how to establish a cost-effective solution. ","465":"Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a promising treatment modality for locally advanced pancreatic cancer. To determine the optimal radiation treatment, we compared the plan characteristics of volumetric-modulated arc therapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy when administered with stereotactic body radiation therapy to treat pancreatic cancer. Fifteen patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer were treated by stereotactic body radiation therapy at a dose of 24-32Gy in four fractions with marker-guided gated volumetric-modulated arc therapy. Four dimensional-computed tomography scans were used to assess the target and surrounding normal organs. The same images, contours, and dose constraints were used for dual-arc volumetric-modulated arc therapy and 9-field intensity-modulated radiation therapy planning. Plans were compared using dosimetric parameters and treatment performance. Volumetric-modulated arc therapy required significantly lower monitor units (1726 vs. 4188; P&lt;0.001) and shorter treatment delivery time in comparison with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (22.5min vs. 52.4min; P&lt;0.001). Regarding target volume coverage, both modalities demonstrated comparable results (V95%, 99.3% vs. 99.4%; P=0.796). Both modalities satisfied the dosimetric determinants for duodenal toxicity and the maximum and mean doses administered to normal organ were also statistically similar. In comparison with 9-field intensity-modulated radiation therapy, volumetric-modulated arc therapy significantly reduces the number of monitoring units and treatment delivery times while administering similar dosimetric quality. Based on these results, volumetric-modulated arc therapy might be an appropriate treatment for locally advanced pancreatic cancer when combined with stereotactic body radiation therapy. ","466":"Alternative and complementary medicine is defined as any substance or technique of non-allopathic medicine used to improve health and quality of life. The purpose of this prospective observational study was to evaluate the use of alternative and complementary medicine during radiotherapy. A questionnaire was given the last week of treatment to all patients treated for breast cancer, prostate cancer or head and neck cancer in our centre in 2016. In 2016, 132 patients were included. Fifty-seven patients (43%) used alternative and complementary medicine during radiotherapy, more women (61%) than men (35%) (P=0.005). The use of alternative and complementary medicine varied according to locations: 44% of head and neck cancers, 57% of breast cancers and 24% of prostate cancers, but sex was the confounding factor. If alternative and complementary medicine was used before radiotherapy, 82% of patients used it during treatment, compared to 30% if they were naive (P&lt;10-7). Healing touch (68%), homeopathy (26%) and magnetisers (21%) were the most used alternative and complementary medicines. Sixty-one percent of patients used alternative and complementary medicine to reduce skin and mucosal side effects of treatments, 28% to improve well-being, and 9% to treat cancer. Seventy-two percent of all patients would advise their loved one to use an alternative and complementary medicine and 87% would like information about them in the hospital. Alternative and complementary medicines are used more by women, and by patients who used them before radiotherapy. The desired effects are mainly to reduce the side effects of the treatments. More than 80% of patients, whether or not they use alternative and complementary medicine, demand medical information. ","467":"Besides its direct cytotoxic effect on the tumor cells, radiation therapy is also able to elicit an immune-mediated systemic anti-tumor response, resulting in tumor regression in irradiated sites but also within distant out of field secondary lesions and providing a long-term anti-tumor response. It is now clear that associating ionizing radiation with immune therapies can enhance radio-induced anti-tumor immune responses. Over the last decade, such a combination aroused considerable interest among the scientific community, with many preclinical models and clinical trials, using many types of immune therapies and radiation regimens. In this article, we summarize the main mechanisms underlying radio-induced anti-tumor responses. We will then present an extended overview of the recent preclinical and clinical research built on this background of combined radiation and immune therapy, shedding light on what we know so far about such a promising strategy.","468":"Glioblastoma is the most frequent primary brain tumor, with more than half of all patients being at least 65 years old. The treatment of the elderly in this pathology represents therefore a considerable challenge for oncologists and radiation therapists. However, in most clinical trials, age is a non-eligible criterial. In the last ten years, geriatric therapeutic trials have been multiplied. The treatment of glioblastoma consists of adjuvant chemoradiotherapy. In elderly patients, the evaluation of performans status and the molecular characteristics of the tumor are important factors in order to propose the appropriate treatment in terms of efficacy and toxicity.","469":"Given the recent increase in the number of human papillomavirus (HPV)-induced cancers in other locations than gynaecological, the number of patients with two cancers at distinct sites, and because of the lack of exhaustive data, we decided to create a multidisciplinary network around an HPV consultation at the Georges-Pompidou European Hospital (HEGP). This network aims to set up the best tools for detecting HPV-associated \"multisite\" precancerous lesions in order to determine the possible impact of dedicated care for this at-risk population. This monthly consultation was created at the HEGP in June 2014. It is currently organized around five consultations: gynaecological, ENT, urological, digestive and immunological. Every patient who has been diagnosed with HPV-related cancer and whose care is provided at the HEGP is offered this particular follow-up: systematically, once the initial lesion has been treated, the patient is convened annually for a day during which it benefits from the consultations mentioned above. A consultation with a psychologist is systematically proposed. Local samples are taken at each site: a cytological examination, the analysis of known predictive and prognostic virological markers are carried out. This study fits more broadly in a theme of clinical and fundamental research around cancers related to HPV.","470":"Since decades, stereotactic radiotherapy has spread out worldwide. Published results are very numerous. To clarify obviousness among all the publications, this recommendation review was written. Voluntarily, authors limited analysis of international best evidence literature on malignant tumors of lung, liver, prostate, head and neck, and metastasis of bone and brain. These data could be used to advance standardization and quality improvement of treatments performed in the nationwide radiotherapy departments and can provide useful guidance for centers worldwide.","471":"Onco, the Regional oncology network of Northern France, in partnership with Cronor, is piloting a project to harmonize radiotherapy practice. In 2016, a working party \"Quality in Radiotherapy\" was set up to encourage all centres in the network to participate in regional experience feedback committees. These committee meetings allow for analysis and handling of adverse events in radiotherapy within predefined areas of expertise. The purpose is to formalize and issue recommendations based on good practice by the use of regional bulletins. This article details how such experiential feedback committees are implemented, what they can contribute and the barriers to such work at each stage of the project.","472":"Currently, there is no international consensus on the best treatment regimen for patients with advanced resectable gastric carcinoma. Three approaches exist abroad continents. In France and Europe, perioperative chemotherapy and gastrectomy with D1.5 lymph-node dissection is the current standard. In Japan and South Korea, postoperative adjuvant chemotherapy after surgery with D2 lymph-node dissection is the standard treatment. In the United States, where limited lymph-node dissection is frequently performed, adjuvant chemoradiotherapy after surgery is the standard treatment. In France, postoperative chemoradiotherapy indications are discussed in limited settings: patients with locally advanced gastric cancer or lymph node involvement discovered on the pathologic report of the gastrectomy without preoperative chemotherapy delivery or in case of non-carcinologic resection (R1). Exclusive chemoradiotherapy can be proposed in patients unfit for surgery.","473":null,"474":"Intensity-modulated radiotherapy makes possible to optimize the irradiation and spare normal tissues. The toxicity remains important with concomitant chemotherapy often associated. The improvement of MRI and PET-CT define more precisely the target volumes, which need a higher dose, but necessitates to respect the rules of contouring. The treatment is uniform whatever the stage but should be individualized based on clinical stage and tumor response. New paradigms concern biology, staging, volumes and doses, fractionation and combined treatments.","475":"The treatment of locally advanced esophageal cancer is still evolving. Surgery was considered as the backbone of the therapeutic management for a long time. Nowadays, chemoradiation has taken a major place in the neoadjuvant setting or as an exclusive treatment. Although some patients benefit from esophagectomy after chemoradiotherapy, a large subset of patients has no benefit and morbi-mortality rates are increased with a trimodality strategy. Patients who will have a local failure are at high risk of distant metastases in the follow-up. A third group of patients will have persistent locoregional disease after chemoradiotherapy and may benefit from surgery, but only a minority of patients with locally advanced disease are eligible. The impact of surgery after upfront chemoradiotherapy on survival and the quality of life of patients with locally advanced squamous cell esophageal cancer remain uncertain. An active surveillance strategy after chemoradiation or salvage esophagectomy for a locally residual disease might improve the prognosis of these patients. An optimized bimodality such as chemoradiotherapy delivering at least 50Gy is still standard and salvage surgery for local persistent disease or a local failure must be discussed in the framework of a multidisciplinary group for selected patients only.","476":"There is a very strong biological and pre-clinical rationale for combining radiotherapy with immune treatment. Radiation affects all steps in the immune response to antigens and clearly upregulates key-molecules on the cancer cell and in the tumor micro-environment, such as MHC class I antigens, tumor-associated antigens and the creation of neo-antigens as well. In many pre-clinical models, radiation together with the right combination and timing of immune therapy leads to regression of distant metastases, at remote non-irradiated sites of the body, the so-called \"abscopal effects\". The combination generally also increases the local tumor control. Although a plethora of clinical trials are ongoing or are being planned, clinical data are sparse and mostly even retrospective. The few published prospective studies nevertheless support a synergy between radiotherapy and immune treatment. At least with checkpoint inhibitors, the side effects of the combined modality treatment do not seem to be significantly higher than of each modality alone. In the coming years, more solid data will surely appear and it is anticipated that radiotherapy will become an integral part of immune therapy.","477":null,"478":null,"479":"An increasing number of patients with cardiac implantable electronic devices benefit from radiotherapy, warranting specific collaborative management between both radiation oncologists and cardiologists. Interactions between electromagnetic fields, secondary particles and cardiac implantable electronic devices may result in transient and reversible malfunctions with significant consequences depending on the underlying cardiac pathology and the level of patient's cardiac implantable electronic devices dependency. Numerous international guidelines on patients' management have been proposed and all agree on a total cumulated dose limit at the battery of 5Gy and on the need for an initial as well as repeated evaluation over time, up to 6months after the last radiation. The analysis of the published data revealed relatively rare incidence of significant adverse events. The most recent international guidelines underline the feasibility and safety of radiotherapy for cardiac implantable electronic devices holders, with the need for systematic local protocol in all radiotherapy centers.","480":"AFQSR has demonstrated, since its creation, its dynamism, by participating in many working groups with the health authorities and national societies and by helping to ensure that quality, through the voice of the quality experts, constitutes a way to progress in the practice and exercise of radiotherapy.","481":"Radiation therapy technique and schedules could be adapted to patient's age because of a natural history of prostate cancer perceived as different, taking into account the comorbidities of patients but also a particular tolerance of elderly subjects. Thus, in localized prostate cancer, evaluation of associated diseases is essential before considering a treatment that will be of interest only if the life expectancy is greater than 10 years. When a curative approach is decided, radiotherapy holds a place of choice. Due to the recent results of randomized studies evaluating moderate hypofractionnated radiotherapy, showing a carcinological equivalence compared to a standard fractionation, this reduction in the duration of treatment appears particularly indicated in this elderly population. This approach permits to maintain the quality of life of patients, potentially with lower costs for society. The purpose of this article is to present the results of randomized trials of moderate hypofractionnation and discuss their application in the population of elderly patients with localized prostate cancer.","482":"Oropharyngeal carcinomas related to the human papilloma virus (HPV; usually HPV16) exhibit biological differences in terms of carcinogenesis and are of relatively better prognosis (in the absence of tobacco consumption) compared to tobacco-related cancers. The therapeutic strategies between these two forms of cancers of the upper aerodigestive tract related to different risk factors are however identical, except therapeutic trial. In the absence of a sufficient level of evidence to define a specific strategy for induced HPV carcinomas, the analysis of the recent literature nonetheless allows us to suggest ways to guide the clinician in his therapeutic choice. Given the relative good prognosis HPV+ oropharyngeal cancers, an important goal is to avoid if possible a multimodal treatment that increases the sequelae and could degrade the quality of life. For the early stages I\/II, it may be desirable to propose minimally invasive surgery if radiotherapy is avoidable or an exclusive conformal radiation therapy by intensity modulation in the opposite case. For the advanced stages III\/IV, the recommendations are similar to those of cancers not related to HPV. Current trials should provide answers on the relevance of therapeutic deflation (absence of chemotherapy in the event of capsular rupture, dose reduction or irradiation volumes, etc.).","483":"Standard of care in breast cancer management is well-defined. However, some gray zones still exist, in particular adjuvant radiotherapy indications in case of pN1mi breast cancer. Here we propose to define their prognosis, to underpin the benefit of adjuvant treatments in such patients' management and to define lymphedema risk, which is the most common late side effect of locoregional treatments.","484":"In adjuvant setting, breast cancer radiotherapy volumes include whole mammary gland or chest wall, and when indicated, nodal area such as axilla, supraclavicular, and internal mammary chain. An accurate patients positioning is required due to some geometric complexity of target volumes closed to organs at risk as heart and lung. Image guided radiation therapy allows such accuracy. Here we propose a review on image guided radiotherapy for breast cancer.","485":"Intensity-modulated radiotherapy, combined with chemotherapy, is the recommended treatment of locally advanced head and neck carcinoma, as a definitive treatment or as an adjuvant treatment following surgery. This technique offers the ability to sculpt the dose closely to the tumor volume. With this close conformity, it is essential to ensure that every day during the treatment the patient position and anatomy are similar to those at the time of treatment planning. Inevitably, there will be uncertainties introduced in this process and a planning target volume margins are added around the tumour volume to compensate for these uncertainties. Various imaging technologies have been integrated with linear accelerators to deal with patient position and potentially reduce the margins. This forms the foundations of image-guided radiotherapy. In patients with head and neck carcinoma systematic and random set-up uncertainties are frequent. The 3D volumetric image guidance systems are efficient to reduce these uncertainties. After a summary about the different sources of uncertainties, this review will present successively the different techniques of image-guided radiotherapy for head and neck carcinomas, along with their advantages and limitations. Then we will focus on the methods used to reduce the set-up uncertainties and finally discuss the concept of adaptive radiotherapy and its application in clinical practice.","486":"Adjuvant radiotherapy is the pillar of breast conserving surgery. Its omission is related with a higher risk of local recurrence and of breast cancer related or non-related mortality. It is of paramount importance to guarantee this treatment is fully administered to all patients after breast conserving surgery, including the elderly. In the last three decades several hypofractionated treatment schemes have shown their non-inferiority, allowing for treatment time reduction facilitating adhesion to treatment and reducing radiotherapy burden. This review focuses on the schemes and indications which have been validated by large phase 3 trials and those which are still under evaluation.","487":"Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is recommended in anal squamous cell carcinoma treatment and is increasingly used in rectal cancer. It adapts the dose to target volumes, with a high doses gradient. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy allows to reduce toxicity to critical normal structures and to consider dose-escalation studies or systemic treatment intensification. Image-guided radiation therapy is a warrant of quality for intensity-modulated radiation therapy, especially for successful delivery of the dose as planned. There is no recommended international or national anorectal cancer image-guided radiation therapy protocol currently available. Dose-escalation trials or expert opinions about intensity-modulated\/image-guided radiation therapy good practice guidelines recommend daily volumetric imaging throughout the treatment or during the five first fractions and weekly thereafter as a minimum. Image-guided radiation therapy allows to reduce margins related to patient setup errors. Internal margin, related to the internal organ motion, needs to be adapted according to short- or long-course radiotherapy, gender, rectal location; it can be higher than current recommended planning target volume margins, particularly in the upper and anterior part of mesorectum, which has the most significant movement. Image-guided radiation therapy based on volumetric imaging allows to take target volume shrinkage into account and to develop adaptive strategies, in particular for mesorectum shrinkage during rectal cancer treatment. Lastly, the emergence of new image-guided radiation therapy technologies including MRI (which plays a major role in pelvic tumours assessment and diagnosis) opens up interesting perspectives for adaptive radiotherapy, taking into account both organs' movements and tumour shrinkage.","488":"If the indications of sentinel lymph node biopsy and axillary lymph node dissection have been the subject of many trials, the indications of radiotherapy, in the absence of axillary lymph node dissection are a matter of debate. We reviewed the available literature on this topic and tried to draw some practical applications. In case of negative result of a sentinel lymph node biopsy, patients could be viewed as having pN0 disease and indications of adjuvant radiotherapy based on this paradigm. However, when the result of a sentinel lymph node biopsy was positive and no axillary lymph node dissection performed, indications of adjuvant radiotherapy are not so clear. For example, micrometastases could indicate a nodal irradiation as in the AMAROS trial, or not as in the IBCSG trial. Indications of postmastectomy radiotherapy are also not clearly defined in this setting. In the end, a clinical proposal was designed, emphasizing the unanswered questions.","489":"Recent technological developments enable the detection and quantification of circulating tumour DNA in the blood, with potentially major clinical implications, particularly for cancers treated with curative intent. Circulating tumour DNA has a potential impact before, during and after treatment. If limitations of this approach remain, requiring further development, it is important to know the principles and applications in view of the potential impact on the clinical practice. In this review, we will discuss the current detection methods, then the place of circulating tumour DNA in oncology and more particularly in radiotherapy.","490":"A narrow therapeutic index and more and more patients with long survival characterize primary and second brain tumors. Image-guided radiotherapy can increase accuracy of the patient's position during a course of intracranial irradiation thanks to a direct or indirect visualization of targets volumes. Treatment reproducibility and organ at risk-sparing are the primary issues, particularly with the development of stereotactic radiotherapy and protontherapy. Regarding intracranial treatments, image-guided radiotherapy seems to be a repetitive task based on skeletal structures registration. And yet, this innovation makes possible to assess the dosimetric impact of daily positioning variations avoiding invasive immobilizations. Image-guided radiotherapy offers automated tools to limit time consumption and furthers adaptive radiotherapy opportunities. Nevertheless, medical evaluation is still necessary and image processing should be strictly defined (frequency, use, performance). The purpose of this article is to describe image-guidance in brain irradiation, as repositioning tool and to focus on its recent prospects.","491":"Recent therapeutic advances in non-small cell lung cancer allow a better understanding of the interactions between the tumour and its direct immune environment. The identification of new immune biomarkers integrating both cell subpopulations and their interactions is a real issue in oncology. New techniques of tissue analysis, particularly multiplex immunohistochemistry, consisting of a labelling of several antigens of interest by immunofluorescence on the same slide, provide a better understanding of the tumour environment. Integration of these modalities of analysis to the therapeutic decision is promising, because it allows an increased characterization of each tumour, particularly interesting with radiotherapy and immunotherapy. This article describes the potential of these assays in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer.","492":"The dematerialization of data, the multiplication of sharing and exchanges between professionals, the increase of business software offer (patient files, human resources management, financial management, document management, etc.) question us about the security of information systems. This protection contributes to the quality of the care of patients in respect of their rights, to ensure the confidentiality, traceability and sustainability of digital personal health data and to strengthen the confidence of professionals in the system and its uses. But what security procedures are currently being undertaken in the radiotherapy centres?","493":"Intensity-modulated radiation therapy reduces the dose to organs at risk in patients treated for gynecological malignancies. Given the steep dose gradients around the planning target volume, internal movement of organs during treatment may cause a planning target volume underdosage and organs at risk overdosage in case of systematic error. It is therefore important to take into account the movement of the pelvic organs and to investigate potential solutions provided by image-guided radiotherapy. A review of the literature was carried out using the following databases: Medline, Embase, Cochrane Library, Web of Science, Cinahl and Pubmed. Appropriate search strategies for each database were applied based upon the following terms \"uterine neoplasms, image-guided radiotherapy, adaptive radiotherapy, organ motion and target volume\". These studies show that uterine motion is mainly influenced by bladder filling and by cervix and vaginal vault motion due to rectal filling. Population-based clinical target volume-planning target volume margins are large resulting in unnecessary organs at risk inclusion within the planning target volume, reducing the benefits of intensity-modulated radiotherapy. As pelvic organ motion seems to be patient specific, individualised planning target volume margins and adaptive radiotherapy strategies could allow adequate coverage of the planning target volume and increase organs at risk savings. In this study, we review the different techniques of image-guided radiotherapy and the perspective of adaptive radiotherapy.","494":"Thirty percent of patients with head and neck cancer are over 70 years. Radiotherapy approach in elderly is a challenge. On one hand, radiotherapy side effects, as well as the number of sessions required, could be a burden. On the other hand, omission of local treatment is not an option due to the symptoms of the tumor. Patients in good general condition may receive standard fractionnated radiotherapy. For frail patients unsuitable for standard fractionated radiotherapy, more convenient shorter course of radiotherapy are commonly used. Physicians have to choose the best radiotherapy schedule according to the objective of the treatment. In case of palliative intend: hypofractionated radiotherapy delivered with a single short course could be recommanded. This course could be followed by other subsequent courses if the patient's condition improves during the treatment. For patients treated in curative intend, the choice of hypofractionation schedule depends on the general condition: split course hypofractionated radiotherapy for unfit patients, or accelerated radiotherapy with concomitant boost for fit patients. In all cases, a high-quality radiotherapy technique and appropriate supportive care are mandatory to minimize the side effects. The ELAN RT trial, soon to be completed, will rule on the non-inferiority of hypofractionated radiotherapy compared to standard radiotherapy for unfit patients.","495":"Image-guided radiotherapy takes place at every step of the treatment in lung cancer, from treatment planning, with fusion imaging, to daily in-room repositioning. Managing tumoral and surrounding thoracic structures motion has been allowed since the routine use of 4D computed tomography (4DCT). The integration of respiratory motion has been made with \"passive\" techniques based on reconstruction images from 4DCT planning, or \"active\" techniques adapted to the patient's breathing. Daily repositioning is based on regular images, weekly or daily, low (kV) or high (MV) energy. MRI and functional imaging also play an important part in lung cancer radiation and open the way for adaptative radiotherapy.","496":"At diagnosis, about 15% of patients with pancreatic cancer present with a resectable tumour, 50% have a metastatic tumour, and 25% a locally advanced tumor (non-metastatic but unresectable due to vascular invasion) or borderline resectable. Despite the technical progress made in the field of radiation therapy and the improvement of the efficacy of chemotherapy, the prognosis of these patients remains very poor. Recently, the role of radiation therapy in the management of pancreatic cancer has been much debated. This review aims to evaluate the role of radiation therapy for these patients.","497":"During the recent past years, the therapeutic management of locally advanced cervical cancer patients has consistently improved, with the integration of image guided brachytherapy and dose escalation strategies leading to an improvement of local control rates. In parallel, the evolution of external beam radiotherapy techniques and the better control of organs at risk doses in brachytherapy have contributed to decrease the probability of severe normal tissue complication. In case of advanced disease, patients prognosis remains however marked by a high risk of distant failure, and this finding has encouraged the assessment of various research pathways in order to better predict and\/or prevent tumor relapse. Major studies are being conducted or have been published, and the place of chemoradiation and brachytherapy has been confirmed as first intent treatment in case of locally advanced disease. Numerous prospective or retrospective data, few of which are reviewed there, have been integrated as part of a strategy aimed at being more and more personalized. Next steps of therapeutic optimization will include the assessment of multiparameters radiological tools, but will also rely on a better understanding of radiobiological pathways involved in local or systemic response to irradiation, and the most promising of those is probably the anti-tumor immune response.","498":"Novel techniques of prostate cancer radiotherapy require increased precision, which is allowed by Image Guided Radiation Therapy (IGRT), using fiducial markers and orthogonal radiographs, cone beam computed tomography, magnetic resonance imaging, ultrasound, and\/or transponders. IGRT may reduce the toxicity of radiation therapy, but there is no clear recommendation on the best IGRT technique and how often it should be applied.","499":null,"500":"Since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy, cancer incidence is still 2 to 3-fold higher in patients infected by human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) than in the general population, with an increased incidence of malignancies not associated with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). HIV-infected patients cancer treatment does not differ from that in the general population. However, the management of those patients have some particularities due to preexisting comorbid conditions, including metabolic, cardiovascular, renal or hepatic complications and the risk for potential drug - drug interactions in HIV-infected patients. In this review, we described efficacy and tolerance of radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy in this frail population treated for cancer. Utilization of modern radiotherapy techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy may improve the treatment tolerance.","501":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a rare condition, with less than 300 cases occurring per year in France. Its treatment can be difficult due to the importance of side effects, but tumor control is usually excellent following a well conducted chemoradiotherapy. This article summarizes the recent advances in nasopharyngeal cancer diagnosis, classification, treatment, surveillance and management of recurrences. Chemotherapy timing is discussed, along with arguments in favor of induction chemotherapy in locally advanced cases. As a survival advantage has been suggested for when patients are treated in high volume center it seems reasonable to refer these young patients for treatment to tertiary expert centers, especially given the low incidence of the disease.","502":"","503":null,"504":"The optimization of radiotherapy in these young and long-lived survivors raises the question about the interest of using modern techniques to allow a better distribution of the dose. The choice of the irradiation technique must take into account the incidence of side effects related to radiation. In this context, the definition of the target volumes as well as the verification and monitoring of the delivered processing are essential. International recommendations for treatment fields are based on the \"involved node radiotherapy\" concept. The best irradiation technique to use remains to be defined. The use of intensity-modulated radiotherapy improves the coverage and reduces the dose to the organs at risk with a variable gain depending on the topography of the lymph nodes: upper or lower mediastinum, right or left lateralization, the techniques used. The deep inspiration breath-hold technique allows an increase of the pulmonary volume, extension of the mediastinum with an up down of the heart which make possible to move the planning target volume away from the cardiac structures. The volumetric-modulated arctherapy technique with several arches can be particularly interesting to reduce the dose to the breasts, as well as tomotherapy when bulky disease. Proton therapy with the Bragg peak specificity can play a key role in limiting doses to organs at risk, when robust planning that will take into account geometric and physical uncertainties is available. The heterogeneity of Hodgkin lymphomas in terms of volume, shape and initial location are the key elements to take into account when choosing the preferred radiotherapy technique.","505":"We report the patient outcomes of a treatment combining proton therapy and Tomotherapy in sinonasal adenoid cystic carcinoma involving skull base. We included patients treated at Curie Institute, Paris, France, between March 2010 and February 2014 for an advanced adenoid cystic carcinoma involving skull base. Patients received Tomotherapy, proton therapy or both. We evaluated treatment toxicity (according to CTCAE V4), local control, distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival. Thirteen patients were included, with a median follow-up of 34 months. Radiation therapy followed surgery for 77% of the patients and margins were positive in all those cases. Median dose was 73.8Gy. Local control, distant metastasis-free survival and overall survival at 3 years were respectively 60%, 48% and 60%. One-sided grade 3 hearing impairment occurred in 46% of the patients. Combining high-dose proton therapy and Tomotherapy is effective and has moderate toxicity in the treatment of T4 sinonasal adenoid cystic carcinoma involving skull base. ","506":"Extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy has developed considerably in recent years and is now an important part of the therapeutic alternatives to be offered to patients with cancer. It offers opportunities that have progressively led physicians to reconsider the therapeutic strategy, for example in the case of local recurrence in irradiated territory or oligometastatic disease. The literature on the subject is rich but, yet, there is no real consensus on therapeutic indications. This is largely due to the lack of prospective, randomized studies that have evaluated this technique with sufficient recoil. We propose a review of the literature on the technical aspects and indications of extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy.","507":"It is now well demonstrated that (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose PET\/CT is the most accurate imaging method for determining disease extent in Hodgkin lymphoma. Thus, up-front PET\/CT is mandatory for involved node radiation therapy design. For a proper use of this new imaging modality for radiotherapy, some adaptations should be made to the PET\/CT acquisition as well as to the report. Initial PET\/CT should be performed in the radiotherapy treatment position. Nuclear medicine physicians should report to the radiation oncologist the precise location of each involved lymph node, for which the use of a common atlas of upper diaphragmatic nodal stations could be useful. All these new procedures have to be implemented in close collaboration among the different medical specialists providing care to Hodgkin lymphoma patients. We report here the usual procedures of PET\/CT acquisition in the radiotherapy environment and propose a more sophisticated description of the different lymph nodes for a more efficient nuclear medicine report to the radiation oncologist.","508":"Neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma of the bladder is a rare and aggressive tumour, accounting for less than 1% of all bladder tumours. Given its rarity and the absence of randomized trials, the therapeutic management of these tumours remains difficult. By analogy with small cell lung cancer, multimodal treatment is often proposed. Radical cystectomy plus chemotherapy and chemoradiation therapy are associated with better survival compared to monotherapy. We report our experience in the management of these tumours with literature review.","509":"Fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positons emission tomography (PET)-computed tomography (CT) is used in many ways at baseline and during the treatment of patients with Hodgkin lymphoma. Many properties of the technique are used in the different steps of patient's management. Initial staging with PET-CT is more accurate than conventional imaging and PET-CT also became the gold standard imaging at the end of treatment with a negative PET-CT mandatory for reaching a complete remission. Early assessment of response by PET-CT is one of the most powerful prognostic factors for progression-free survival of patients with localized and advanced stages and allows guiding treatment. Conversely, previous studies showed that there is no role of FDG PET-CT for the patient's follow-up.","510":"External beam radiation therapy is an efficient treatment, which relieves pain associated with bone metastases, and is prescribed in worldwide. Although bone metastases palliative irradiation recommendations exist, international clinical practices remain variable. The purpose of this article is to show the clinical practices evolution though clinical trials, cost studies and techniques' progression.","511":"To report our experience of failure mode and effective analysis for high dose rate brachytherapy of gynaecological cancer carried out in our hospital. Failure mode and effective analysis process described in AAPM TG 100 was followed: a multidisciplinary team consisting of two physicians, physicists, dosimetrists, a medical resident, a nurse, and a secretary was formed. A weekly meeting was held for four months. A process tree was created based on the overview of the entire process, with the main branches as follows: procedure in the operating room, patient imaging, contouring, treatment planning, machine quality assurance and treatment delivery. Each team member assigned the risk probability numbers based on the predefined scoring system. For a particular failure mode, if the risk probability number assigned by one member differed from the other, the highest risk probability number was taken into consideration. The process tree consisted of 185 nodes, with risk probability numbers ranging from 1-220, with 77 possible failure modes. Four nodes were found with risk probability numbers greater than 200, which were considered for immediate process improvements. Twenty-four nodes were found to be with risk probability numbers ranging from 100 to 200. All 24 processes were considered for process improvement, out of which 12 were found effective and feasible, which includes failure nodes with high severity score at least 8. The processes with high-risk probability numbers (greater than 200) were reduced after the introduction of process improvements. For the other processes, standard procedures were modified. The common causes of failure, were found to be due to lack of attention, human error and work pressure. Failure mode and effective analysis is a useful tool that uses a systematic approach for quality management of a specific process. ","512":"The treatment of local recurrence of a previously irradiated cancer or a second cancer arising in-field remains challenging. Ultimately, the objective of salvage therapy is to control disease while ensuring minimal collateral damage, thereby optimizing both cancer and toxicity outcomes. Reirradiation has historically been associated with unacceptable toxicity and a limited benefit. Brachytherapy offers the best dose distribution and a high radiation dose to the target volume while better protecting surrounding previously irradiated healthy tissues. The management of local cancer recurrence in irradiated areas should be planned through multidisciplinary discussions and patients should be selected carefully. This overview of the literature describes brachytherapy as a reirradiation treatment in local recurrences of previously irradiated prostate, breast, head and neck and rectal cancers, or second primary cancers occurring in-field. For these cancers, the prognosis and therapeutic challenges are quite different and depend on the type of primary cancer. However, current data confirm that brachytherapy reirradiation is feasible and has acceptable toxicity.","513":"The main indications of the brachytherapy of head and neck cancers are the limited tumours of the lip, the nose, the oral cavity and the oropharynx. Nasopharynx tumours are nowadays treated by intensity-modulated radiotherapy. This technique can be exclusive, associated with external radiotherapy or postoperative. It can also be a salvage treatment for the second primaries in previously irradiated areas. If the low dose rate brachytherapy rules remain the reference, the pulse dose rate technique allows the prescription of the dose rate and the optimisation of the dose distribution. Results of high dose rate brachytherapy are now published. This paper reports the recommendations of the Gec-ESTRO, published in 2017, and takes into account the data of the historical low dose rate series, and is upgraded with the pulsed-dose rate and high dose rate series.","514":"Most preclinical studies examining the radiobiology of brachytherapy have focused on dose rate effects. Scarcer data are available on other major parameters of therapeutic index, such as cell cycle distribution, repopulation or reoxygenation. The linear quadratic model describes the effect of radiotherapy in terms of normal tissue or tumour response. It allows some comparisons between various irradiation schemes. This model should be applied cautiously for brachytherapy, because it relies on cell death analysis only, and therefore partially reflects the biological effects of an irradiation. Moreover, the linear quadratic model validity has not been demonstrated for very high doses per fraction. A more thorough analysis of mechanisms involved in radiation response is required to better understand the true effect of brachytherapy on normal tissue. The modulation of immune response is one promising strategy to be tested with brachytherapy. A translational approach applied to brachytherapy should lead to design trials testing pharmacological agents modulating radiation response, in order to improve not only local control, but also decrease the risk of distant failure. Here we review the radiobiology of brachytherapy, from the historical view based on linear quadratic model to recent perspectives for biological optimization.","515":"Imaging has probably been the most important driving force for the development of brachytherapy treatments the last 20 years. Due to implementation of three-dimensional imaging, brachytherapy is nowadays a highly accurate and reliable treatment option for many cancer patients. To be able to optimize the dose distribution in brachytherapy the anatomy and the applicator(s) or sources should be correctly localised in the images. For computed tomography (CT) the later criteria is easily fulfilled for most brachytherapy sites. However, for many sites, like cervix and prostate, CT is not optimal for delineation since soft tissue is not adequately visualized and the tumor is not well discriminated. For cervical cancer treatment planning based on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) is recommended. Some centres also use MRI for postimplant dosimetry of permanent prostate seed implant and high dose rate prostate brachytherapy. Moreover, in so called focal brachytherapy where only a part of the prostate is treated, multiparametric MRI is an excellent tool that can assist in defining the target volume. Applicator or source localization is challenging using MRI, but tolls exist to assist this process. Also, geometrical distortions should be corrected or accounted for. Transrectal ultrasound is considered to be the gold standard for high dose rate prostate brachytherapy and transrectal ultrasound -based brachytherapy procedure offers a method for interactive treatment planning. Reconstruction of the needles is sometimes challenging, especially to identify the needle tip. The accuracy of the reconstruction could be improved by measuring the residuals needle length and by using a bi-planar transducer. The last decade several groups worldwide have explored the use of transrectal and transabdominal ultrasound for cervical cancer brachytherapy. Since ultrasonography is widely available, offers fast image acquisition and is a rather inexpensive modality such development is interesting. However, more work is needed to establish this as an adequate alternative for all phases of the treatment planning process. Studies using positron emission tomography imaging in combination with brachytherapy treatment planning are limited. However, development of new tracers may offer new treatment approaches for brachytherapy in the future. Combination of several image modalities will be the optimal solution in many situations, either during the same session or for different fractions. When several image modalities are combined so called image registration procedures are used and it is important to understand the principles and limitations of such procedures.","516":"Endobronchial brachytherapy could be proposed in case of endoluminal tumours either as a palliative or a curative treatment. As a curative treatment, endobronchial brachytherapy could obtain a high local control rate in case of limited disease. In palliative setting, endobronchial brachytherapy improved thoracic symptoms in more than 80% of cases, but it is less efficient than external beam radiation therapy for palliation. It could be also proposed to maintain the airway open after laser therapy. Oesophageal brachytherapy is a valuable option as a palliative treatment, underused at this time. It causes less side effects and a better quality of life compared to self-expanded metallic stents. For a curative aim, there is today no demonstration that a combination of external beam radiotherapy and oesophageal brachytherapy give better results than external beam radiotherapy alone in locally advanced tumours. For superficial diseases, the combination of external beam radiotherapy and oesophageal brachytherapy seems, on the contrary, promising.","517":"Prostate brachytherapy has been for a long time one of the standard treatments for low risk prostate cancer, with high rates of biochemical control and low levels of urinary and sexual late toxicity compared to other available techniques, namely external beam radiotherapy and radical prostatectomy. The aim of this article is to review the recent innovations of prostate brachytherapy, which suggest a bright future for the technique. We will discuss the extension of indications of permanent implant brachytherapy to favorable intermediate-risk patients, the use of novel isotopes such as Palladium 103 and Cesium 131, and the benefit of brachytherapy as a boost following external beam radiotherapy for intermediate and high-risk patients. We will also discuss the rise of high dose rate brachytherapy, as a boost or monotherapy, the increasing use of MRI for patient selection and treatment planning, as well as the development of brachytherapy as a means of focal therapy.","518":"While outcomes for patients with locally advanced disease have improved considerably with combined modality therapy, there is now an emphasis on developing risk-adapted treatment strategies. Moreover, the primary cause of death from locally advanced rectal cancer is related to distant progression, which now exceeds the rate of local failure. Thus, the necessity to optimally address micrometastatic disease has led to increasing interest in delivering chemotherapy in the neoadjuvant setting rather than in the postoperative setting. This review critically appraises the emerging literature on the options for sequencing of therapy, focusing on the total neoadjuvant therapy paradigm as well as emerging options for omitting components of multimodality therapy.","519":"Brachytherapy remains the best irradiation technique to deliver a high dose in a small volume. Breast brachytherapy is part of the arsenal of therapy in the management of breast cancer. In this article, we present the technical data related to multicatheter interstitial brachytherapy to the breast proceeding, from the implantation of the vectors to the treatment itself. The indications for brachytherapy in breast cancer are boost after whole breast irradiation, accelerated partial breast irradiation or selected patients with second ipsilateral breast tumor event. The results in terms of efficacy and toxicity are presented for each indication. Multicatheter interstitial breast brachytherapy remains a major technique for breast cancer treatment.","520":"Since 1995, the brachytherapy dosimetry protocols follow the methodology recommended by the Task Group 43. This methodology, which has the advantage of being fast, is based on several approximations that are not always valid in clinical conditions. Model-based dose calculation algorithms have recently emerged in treatment planning stations and are considered as a major evolution by allowing for consideration of the patient's finite dimensions, tissue heterogeneities and the presence of high atomic number materials in applicators. In 2012, a report from the American Association of Physicists in Medicine Radiation Therapy Task Group 186 reviews these models and makes recommendations for their clinical implementation. This review focuses on the use of model-based dose calculation algorithms in the context of iridium 192 treatments. After a description of these algorithms and their clinical implementation, a summary of the main questions raised by these new methods is performed. Considerations regarding the choice of the medium used for the dose specification and the recommended methodology for assigning materials characteristics are especially described. In the last part, recent concrete examples from the literature illustrate the capabilities of these new algorithms on clinical cases.","521":"","522":"These recent years, brachytherapy has benefited from imaging modalities advances. A more systematic use of tomodensitometric, ultrasonographic and MRI images during brachytherapy procedures has allowed an improvement in target and organs at risk assessment as well as their relationship with the applicators. New concepts integrating tumor regression during treatment have been defined and have been clinically validated. New applicators have been developed and are commercially available. Optimization processes have been developed, integrating hypofractionation modalities leading to tumor control improvement. All these opportunities led to further development of brachytherapy, with indisputable ballistic advantages, especially compared to external irradiation.","523":"Brachytherapy has known major improvements in recent decades. It represents an essential component of local treatment of cervix cancers. One major breakthrough was the advent of 3D imaging for image-guided brachytherapy. Doses could be prescribed to volumes. This allows better delineation and coverage of target volumes, as well as organs at risk (bladder, rectum, sigmoid) protection. Local recurrences have been consequently reduced and survival has been improved. In addition, improvement and development of new applicators have facilitated the delivery of interstitial treatments. Afterloading applicators, associated with 3D imaging, allow dosimetry optimization in order to improve the coverage of the target volumes (dose in 90% of the high risk clinical target volume) and to limit dose to the organs at risk. In the future, more personalized treatments will be achieved through more advanced applicators and\/or by improving the accuracy of imaging at the time of brachytherapy.","524":"Radiation-induced mucositis is a common toxicity, especially in patients with head and neck cancers. Despite recent technological advances in radiation therapy, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, radiation-induced mucositis is still causing treatment disruptions, negatively affecting patients' long and short term quality of life, and impacting medical resources use with economic consequences. The objective of this article was to review the latest updates in the management of radiation-induced mucositis, with a focus on pharmaceutical strategies for the prevention or treatment of mucositis. Although numerous studies analysing the prevention and management of oral radiation-induced mucositis have been conducted, there are still few reliable data to guide daily clinical practice. Furthermore, most of the tested drugs have shown no (anti-inflammatory cytokine, growth factors) or limited (palifermin) effect. Therapies for acute oral mucositis are predominantly focused on improving oral hygiene and providing symptoms control. Although low-level laser therapy proved efficient in preventing radiation-induced oral mucositis in patients with head and neck cancer, this intervention requires equipment and trained medical staff, and is therefore insufficiently developed in clinical routine. New effective pharmacological agents able to prevent or reverse radio-induced mucositis are required.","525":"Skull base meningioma leads to functional disturbances, which can significantly alter the quality of life. The optimal management of these lesions, whose goals are neurological preservation and tumour local control, is not yet clearly established. It is widely recognized that the goal of a radical excision should be abandoned despite the advances in the field of microsurgery of skull base lesions. Although less morbid, partial tumour excision would be associated with increased risk of local tumour recurrence. Although discussed both exclusive and adjuvant have proven to be highly successful in terms of clinical improvement and local control. Various radiation techniques have demonstrated their efficacy in the management of this pathology. However, high rates of clinical improvement are in contrast with low rates of radiological improvement. The notion of clinical and radiological dissociation appeared. However, in most of these studies, the analysis of the radiological response could be subject of legitimate criticism. This work proposes to review the local control, the efficacy and the clinical tolerance and the radiological response of the various radiation techniques for the meningioma of the base of the skull and to demonstrate the interest of quantitative volumetric analyses in the follow-up of meningioma after radiotherapy.","526":"","527":"The definition of nodal and\/or mucosal target volumes for radiation therapy for lymphadenopathies of unknown primary is controversial. Target volumes may include all nodal areas bilaterraly and be pan-mucosal or unilateral, selective, including the sole oropharyngeal mucosa. This review presents current recommendations in light of changes in the TNM classification, Human papillomavirus status and therapeutic advances. We conducted a systematic review of the literature with the following keywords: lymphadenopathy; head and neck; unknown primary and radiation therapy. There are no direct comparative studies between unilateral or bilateral nodal irradiation or pan-mucosal and selective mucosal irradiation. Contralateral lymph node failure rates range from 0 to 6% after unilateral nodal irradiation and 0 and 31% after bilateral irradiation. Occurrence of a mucosal primary varies between 0 and 19.2%. Initial clinical presentation and Human papillomavirus status are critical to define mucosal target volumes. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy is recommended (rather than three-dimensional irradiation) to avoid toxicities. Systemic treatments have similar indications as for identified primary head and neck cancers. Failures do not appear superior in case of unilateral nodal irradiation but comparative studies are warranted due to major biases hampering direct comparisons. Human papillomavirus status should be incorporated into the therapeutic strategy and practice-changing TNM staging changes will need to be evaluated.","528":"Modern standards of precision radiotherapy, primarily driven by the technological advances of intensity modulation and image guidance, have led to increased versatility in radiotherapy planning and delivery. The ability to shape doses around critical normal organs, while simultaneously \"painting\" boost doses to the tumor have translated to substantial therapeutic gains in head and neck cancer patients. Recently, dose adaptation (or adaptive radiotherapy) has been proposed as a novel concept to enhance the therapeutic ratio of head and neck radiotherapy, facilitated in part by the onset of molecular and functional imaging. These contemporary imaging techniques have enabled visualisation of the spatial molecular architecture of the tumor. Daily cone-beam imaging, besides improving treatment accuracy, offers another unique angle to explore radiomics - a novel high throughput feature extraction and selection workflow, for adapting radiotherapy based on real-time tumor changes. Here, we review the existing evidence of molecular and functional imaging in head and neck cancers, as well as the current application of adaptive radiotherapy in the treatment of this tumor type. We propose that adaptive radiotherapy can be further exploited through a systematic application of molecular and functional imaging, including radiomics, at the different phases of planning and treatment.","529":"Primary breast sarcomas are heterogeneous tumours derived from non-epithelial mammary gland structures. Although they represent a rare entity, their incidence may increase in the coming years owing to conservative approach considered in the treatment of breast cancer. The aim of this work was to highlight the effect of postoperative irradiation in the treatment of these tumours. This is a retrospective study conducted at the Mohammed-VI centre for cancer treatment between 2004 and 2011. Survival rates were calculated by the Kaplan-Meier method. Fifteen cases were collected. The median age was 41.9years. Phyllode sarcoma accounted for 66% of this series. Surgical treatment was performed in 93% of the patients with negative margins in 33.33% of the cases. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy was indicated in 46% of the patients with locally advanced tumours and 66% of the patients received postoperative radiotherapy for positive or close margins. Five years overall survival and relapse free survival was not significantly different with the use of adjuvant radiotherapy. Due to the rarity of this entity and the absence of randomized trials, evidence based management is still lacking. However, a multidisciplinary approach is to be required including surgical excision followed by radiotherapy, depending on the tumour characteristics.

Breast cancers following Hodgkin lymphoma have been relatively well studied. Breast cancers after radiotherapy covering or nearby breasts or nipples are usually carcinomas or secondary sarcomas. Among the big cohort of patients treated for breast carcinomas, breast lymphomas developed in the same area are not usual. Nevertheless, published studies described a significant increased risk of non-Hodgkin lymphoma after initial radiotherapy for a solid cancer. Here, we report a case of a secondary breast lymphoma observed in a 53-year-old woman treated 13 years before for a ductal carcinoma and analyse such second tumors with a review of the literature. This case report emphasizes the importance of the biopsy in case of recurrence in breast cancer to give the appropriate treatment.","535":"To identify predictive (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET)\/computed tomography (CT)-based parameters for locoregional control, disease-free survival and overall survival, by testing different thresholds of metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis in patients with locally-advanced cervical cancer. Thirty-seven patients treated with standard chemoirradiation underwent a pretreatment (18F)-FDG-PET\/CT. Using different thresholds of maximum standardized uptake value, the following PET parameters were computed: maximum standardized uptake value, mean standardized uptake value, metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis for primary tumor and lymph nodes and a new parameter combining the metabolic tumor volume and the distance between lymph nodes and the primary tumor, namely metabolic node distance. Correlation between PET and clinical parameters with clinical outcome (overall survival, disease-free survival, and locoregional control) was assessed using univariate and multivariate analyses (Cox model). In univariate analyses, PET\/CT parameters associated with overall survival and disease-free survival were: metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis of the primary tumor, total lesion glycolysis of lymph nodes and metabolic node distance. The most predictive threshold segmentation for metabolic tumor volume and total lesion glycolysis was 48% of maximum standardized uptake value for the primary tumor and 30% for the lymph nodes. In multivariate Cox analysis, the total lesion glycolysis of primary tumor 48% and metabolic node distance were the two independent risk factors for overall survival (P&lt;0.01), disease-free survival (P&lt;0.01) and locoregional control (P=0.046). Total lesion glycolysis of primary tumor and distance between the invaded positive lymph node and the primary tumor seem to have the highest predictive value when compared to classical clinical prognostic parameters and may be useful to identify high risk groups at time of diagnosis and to tailor the therapeutic approach in locally-advanced cervical cancer. ","536":"In radiotherapy, the treatment is adapted to each individual to protect healthy tissues but delivers most of time a standard dose according to the tumor histology and site. The only biomarkers studied to individualize the treatment are the HPV status with radiation dose de-escalation strategies, and tumor hypoxia with dose escalation to hypoxic subvolumes using FMISO- or FAZA-PET imaging. In the last decades, evidence has grown about the contribution of the immune system to radiation tumor response. Many preclinical studies have identified some of the mechanisms involved. In this context, we have realised a systematic review to highlight potential inflammatory and immune biomarkers of radiotherapy response. Some are inside the tumor microenvironment, as lymphocyte infiltration or PD-L1 expression, others are circulating biomarkers, including different types of hematological cells, cytokines and chemokines.","537":null,"538":"We represent in this study the long term results of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy in Tunisian patients with locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Between January 2004 and December 2008, 32 patients with locoregional advanced non metastatic disease (T2b or above and\/or N1 or above AJCC 2002) were treated in our institution by three cycles of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil induction chemotherapy every 21 days followed by concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Conventional radiotherapy was delivered using a cobalt 60 machine during 7 weeks with weekly cisplatin (40mg\/m2). Twenty-nine patients (90%) had presented an objective clinical response in lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, with a complete response in 28%. Acute toxicity of docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil induction chemotherapy was dominated by vomiting (59%), asthenia (40.6%), diarrhea (34.4%) and febrile neutropenia (15.6%). The complete response rate after the end of treatment was around 80%. The 5 years overall survival and disease-free survival were respectively 68.2% and 67.5%.

This assessment call for a framework allowing homogeneous and reproducible practices in the different centers using this radiotherapy schedule. The French Genito-Urinary Group (GETUG) provides here recommendations for daily practice of moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer, with indications, dose, fractionation, pre-treatment planning, volume of interest delineation (target volume and organs at risk) and margins, dose constraints and radiotherapy techniques.","540":"Intensity-modulated radiotherapy needs the strict delineation of target volumes as well as organs at risk and the time used for this procedure is long. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the Workflow Box system (Mirada Medical, UK) for automatic delineation and segmentation for everyday use of organs at risk and lymph nodes delineation in patients treated for early stage breast cancer. Twenty patients' CT scans in treatment position for their breast cancer radiotherapy were delineated in respect of the ESTRO delineation guidelines to begin the creation of automatic delineation atlas. Then 30 other CT scans were delineated this time by the automatic delineation system and by the radiation oncologist (reference delineation plan). The precision of the delineation was evaluated using the overlap volume index and evaluation of standard deviation (SD). The study of organs at risk has shown that the mean overlap volumes were between 0.49 (SD=0.21) and 0.97 (ET=0.03). Five organs at risk out of nine had overlap volumes at least 0.8. The mean overlap volume for all organs at risk was 0.77 (SD=0.17). The system was less performing for the lymph nodes with a mean overlap volume of 0.43 (SD=0.1) and ranging between 0.23 (SD=0.13) and 0.52 (SD=0.1). The use of this system reduced the delineation time by 40% per patient. For patients with breast cancer, the system for automatic delineation and segmentation Workflow Box (Mirada Medical, UK) permitted to safely shorten the time for delineation with acceptable organs at risk delineation. Improvement of lymph node volumes is needed. A new evaluation will be realized after using the system in routine practice. ","541":"The main objective of our study is to evaluate response and toxicity profile in patients receiving external beam radiotherapy with concurrent chemotherapy followed by intraluminal brachytherapy boost for a carcinoma of the oesophagus. Twenty patients with biopsy-proven carcinoma of the oesophagus received external beam radiotherapy (50Gy in 25 fractions) with concurrent chemotherapy (cisplatin: 40mg\/m2). After a gap of two to three weeks, intraluminal brachytherapy (10Gy in two fractions each 1 week apart by a high dose rate 60Co source) was given. Response was evaluated at 1 month and at 1 year of completion of treatment. In addition, acute and chronic toxicity was evaluated at 1 month and 6 months of treatment. Complete response were seen in 80% of patients and partial response in 20% at 1 month. Moreover, there were 65% complete response, 10% local recurrences, 15% patients showed local control with distant metastasis and 10% patients died at 1 year. Grade 1, grade 2 and grade 3 oesophagitis were seen in 10%, 70% and 20% of patients respectively. Stricture was seen in 40% of patients and fistula in 10% of patients. There was no spinal cord, cardiac and nephrotoxicity found. With the concept that high tumoricidal dose for adequate tumor control achieved by intraluminal brachytherapy as a mean of dose escalation, while sparing surrounding normal tissue and potentially improving therapeutic ratio, external beam radiotherapy followed by intraluminal brachytherapy could be a better choice for oesophagus carcinoma.

The objective of this study was to compare the current practices of a French radiotherapy department for the treatment of uncomplicated bone metastases with data from the literature in order to improve and optimize the management of patients. A retrospective monocentric study of patients who underwent palliative irradiation of uncomplicated bone metastases was performed. Ninety-one patients had 116 treatments of uncomplicated bone metastases between January 2014 and December 2015, including 44 men (48%) and 47 women (52%) with an average age of 63years (25-88years). Primary tumours most commonly found were breast cancer (35%), lung cancer (16%) and prostate cancer (12%). The regimens used were in 29% of cases 30Gy in ten fractions (group 30Gy), in 21% of cases 20Gy in five fractions (group 20Gy), in 22% of cases 8Gy in one fraction (group 8Gy) and in 28% of cases 23.31Gy in three fractions of stereotactic body irradiation (stereotactic group). The general condition of the patient (P&lt;0.001), pain score and analgesic (P&lt;0.001), oligometastatic profile (P=0.003) and practitioner experience (P&lt;0.001) were factors influencing the choice of the regimen irradiation. Age (P=0.46), sex (P=0.14), anticancer treatments (P=0.56), concomitant hospitalization (P=0.14) and the distance between the radiotherapy centre and home (P=0.87) did not influence the decision significantly. A total of three cases of spinal compression and one case of post-therapeutic fracture were observed, occurring between one and 128days and 577days after irradiation, respectively. Eight percent of all irradiated metastases were reirradiated with a delay ranging between 13 and 434days after the first irradiation. The re-irradiation rate was significantly higher after 8Gy (P=0.02). The rate of death was significantly lower in the stereotactic arm (P&lt;0.001) and overall survival was significantly greater in the stereotactic arm (P&lt;0.001). This study showed that patients' analysed was comparable to the population of different studies. Predictive factors for the choice of the treatment regimen were identified. Non-fractionnated therapy was underutilised while stereotactic treatment was increasingly prescribed, showing an evolution in the management of patients.

Six expert sarcoma radiation oncologists (members of French Sarcoma Group) received two extremity soft tissue sarcoma radiation therapy cases 1: one preoperative and one postoperative. They were distributed with instructions for contouring gross tumour volume or reconstructed gross tumour volume, clinical target volume and to propose a planning target volume. The preoperative radiation therapy case was a patient with a grade 1 extraskeletal myxoid chondrosarcoma of the thigh. The postoperative case was a patient with a grade 3 pleomorphic undifferentiated sarcoma of the thigh. Contour agreement analysis was performed using kappa statistics. For the preoperative case, contouring agreement regarding GTV, gross tumour volume GTV, clinical target volume and planning target volume were substantial (kappa between 0.68 and 0.77). In the postoperative case, the agreement was only fair for reconstructed gross tumour volume (kappa: 0.38) but moderate for clinical target volume and planning target volume (kappa: 0.42). During the workshop discussion, consensus was reached on most of the contour divergences especially clinical target volume longitudinal extension. The determination of a limited cutaneous cover was also discussed. Accurate delineation of target volume appears to be a crucial element to ensure multicenter clinical trial quality assessment, reproducibility and homogeneity in delivering RT. radiation therapy RT. Quality assessment process should be proposed in this setting. We have shown in our study that preoperative radiation therapy of extremity soft tissue sarcoma has less inter-observer contouring variability.

From 2012 to 2014, 14 patients (male: nine; female: five) have been treated by contact irradiation after resection of a malignant tumor of the conjunctiva (melanoma: five patients; malignant fibrous histiocytoma: one patient; carcinoma: eight patients) The treatment was performed using the Papillon 50 machine (Ariane). Three to four sessions were delivered, each giving a dose of 10Gy. The median follow-up in survivors was 33 months. The tolerance was good. A cataract was seen in one patient, and a moderate eye dryness in one. There was no corneal ulcer. One patient died of intercurrent disease. One patient with carcinoma recurred locally. Adjuvant contact radiotherapy provides a good local control after resection of conjunctival malignancies (melanoma, malignant histiocytofibroma, carcinoma). Thanks to its precision, this technique is well tolerated with a low rate of complications. Furthermore, it is delivered on an ambulatory basis. ","549":"The value of adjuvant radiotherapy for patients with positive lymph nodes after curative resection of oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma is controversial. This study aims to investigate its long-term benefits in a specific cohort. The charts between 1990 and 2003 from patients with positive lymph nodes were retrospectively reviewed. Those subjects were divided into adjuvant radiotherapy and surgery alone groups, with two subgroups defined by radiation dose (cutoff value: 50Gy). Overall survival, disease-free survival and locoregional recurrence-free survival were compared between two groups, with predictive factors of overall survival analysed meanwhile. In sum, 175 matched patients with 1:2 ratios for group balance were enrolled for final analysis. During the follow-up (median: 37.0 months), 143 (81.7%) deaths were recorded, with 70.6% of deaths from cancer progression. The median overall survival time (19.5, 4 to 172 months) was not significantly different between the two groups (18.9 vs. 20.0 months, P=0.179). However, the disease-free survival time was significantly shorter in the adjuvant radiotherapy group than that in the control group (median, 11.5 vs. 14.9 months; P=0.001), with the locoregional recurrence-free survival time impressively prolonged (median: 18.3 vs. 16.5 months; P=0.022). Age (P=0.030), number (P=0.005) and ratio (P=0.002) of positive lymph nodes were associated with overall survival, but radiation dose was not (P=0.204). Adjuvant radiotherapy with low- or high-dose did not improve survival compared with surgery alone. However, radiotherapy was effective to control locoregional recurrence, and could be applied as salvage therapy when recurrence event occurred. ","550":"Malignant tumors of the head and neck have a predominantly regional recurrence pattern, with most deaths resulting from this progression. Optimization of re-radiation in recurrence setting is a major objective for these patients. Extensive research has been carried out with the PubMed search engine to find publications dealing with this topic. The first attempts to reirradiate the ORL sphere date back to the 1980s and the first to be performed by intensity modulation conformational radiotherapy (IMRT) date back to the late 1990s. Compared to 3 dimensional conformal radiotherapy, IMRT improves clinical outcomes and reduces toxicity. In IMRT series, associated or not with concomitant chemotherapy, the locoregional control obtained at 2 years was of the order of 45 to 65% and the overall survival of 15 to 60%, depending on predictive factors. Grade 3 acute toxicity occurred on the order of 10 to 30% and late-grade 3 toxicity on the order of 15 to 50%. In a selected population with low volumes tumors, stereotactic re-irradiation at a minimum dose of 35Gy obtained outcome comparable to IMRT. Re-irradiation of head and neck tumors by proton therapy is rare. The toxicity rate appears to be lower than that usually seen after photon therapy. However, we do not have a long follow-up. This technique therefore remains reserved for search protocols and represents a future perspective in these situations.","551":"Historically, electron boost dose mainly was delivered by a direct field in adjuvant radiotherapy of breast cancer. In this prospective study, we investigated direct electron field, in terms of optimal coverage of tumour bed volume following localization using ultrasound and surgical clips. First, for all 24 patients, a breast sonographer drew perimeter of tumour bed on the breast skin. Then an electron boost field was outlined on the demarcated territory, and a lead wire marker compatible with CT scan was placed on the field borders by a 2cm margin. After CT scan simulation, all patients underwent adjuvant whole breast irradiation with 3D-conformal radiotherapy to 50Gy in 25 fractions. Then for boost radiotherapy, lead wire in CT images was countoured as electron boost field. Also, the tumour bed was contoured based on surgical clips (true clinical target volume and true planning target volume). Electron treatment planning was done for electron boost field. Finally isodose coverages for true planning target volume investigated. On average, 16.68% of clips planning target volume (true planning target volume; range: 0.00 to 95%) received 90% oor more of the prescribed dose when the electron treatment plan was made. Isodose curves does not provide adequate coverage on the tumour bed (clips planning target volume) when electron boost treatment planning was generated for electron boost field (en face electron field). In fact, a part of target (planning target volume-c) is missed and more doses is absorbed in normal tissue. Electron boost treatment planning (an en face electron field) following tumour bed localization using ultrasonography does not provide an optimized coverage of tumour bed volume.

Most cases have been described after postoperative radiotherapy for breast cancer. Corticosteroids represent the main treatment, prognosis is generally favorable. We described a case of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia after stereotactic ablative radiation therapy for a recurrent lung cancer. Antibiotics and steroids were administered to solve the clinical picture. After three years, a new lesion at the right lung was found and treated with stereotactic ablative radiation therapy and concomitant long course of steroids with no recurrence of bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia. Bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia is a rare event after radiotherapy with undefined risk factors. In our case, steroids played an important role in management and, maybe, in preventing bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia recurrence after second course of stereotactic ablative radiation therapy.","554":"The role of postmastectomy radiotherapy following primary systemic treatment in patients with clinical T1-2N1 breast cancer remains a controversial issue. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the benefit of postmastectomy radiotherapy following primary systemic treatment. Between 2005 and 2012, in two independent institutions, female patients with T1-2N1 breast cancer receiving primary systemic treatment followed by mastectomy and lymph node dissection because bad response, then treated with or without chest wall and regional lymph node irradiation have been studied retrospectively. The patients received normofractionated radiotherapy using 3D conformal photons or electron techniques. Locoregional recurrence-free survival, distant metastasis-free survival and disease-free survival were calculated using Kaplan-Meier method. Univariate analysis of potential prognostic factors was performed using log-rank test. Eighty-eight patients have been studied. Of them, 75 patients received postmastectomy radiotherapy. At surgery, 53 patients achieved ypN0. Median follow-up was 67 months. Postmastectomy radiotherapy significantly improved locoregional recurrence-free survival, with a 5-year rate of 96.9% versus 78.6% in the group that did not have postmastectomy radiotherapy. In the subgroup of 53 patients achieving ypN0, postmastectomy radiotherapy improved locoregional recurrence-free survival (a 5-year rate of 94.7% vs. 72.9%), distant metastasis-free survival (a 5-year rate of 92.8% vs. 75%) and disease-free survival (a 5-year rate of 92.9% vs. 62.5%). By univariate analysis, postmastectomy radiotherapy was the only significant prognostic factor affecting locoregional recurrence-free survival. For patients with clinical T1-2N1 disease, postmastectomy radiotherapy could significantly improve locoregional recurrence-free survival after primary systemic treatment and be even more therapeutic in the subgroup of patients with good response for primary systemic treatment by improving locoregional recurrence-free, distant metastasis-free and disease-free survival. Larger prospective studies are needed to confirm our findings. ","555":null,"556":"In external beam radiotherapy, the dose planning is currently based on computed tomography (CT) images. A relation between Hounsfield numbers and electron densities (or mass densities) is necessary for dose calculation taking heterogeneities into account. In image-guided radiotherapy process, the cone beam CT is classically used for tissue visualization and registration. Cone beam CT for dose calculation is also attractive in dose reporting\/monitoring perspectives and particularly in a context of dose-guided adaptive radiotherapy. The accuracy of cone beam CT-based dose calculation is limited by image characteristics such as quality, Hounsfield numbers consistency and restrictive sizes of volume acquisition. The analysis of the literature identifies three kinds of strategies for cone beam CT-based dose calculation: establishment of Hounsfield numbers versus densities curves, density override to regions of interest, and deformable registration between CT and cone beam CT images. Literature results show that discrepancies between the reference CT-based dose calculation and the cone beam CT-based dose calculation are often lower than 3%, regardless of the method. However, they can also reach 10% with unsuitable method. Even if the accuracy of the cone beam CT-based dose calculation is independent of the method, some strategies are promising but need improvements in the automating process for a routine implementation.","557":"The aim of this study was to assess efficacy and safety of proton beam therapy of paragangliomas of the head and neck, rare benign tumours developed close to crucial structures such as cranial nerves and vascular tissues. Ten patients with a paraganglioma of the head and neck were treated from 2001 to 2014 with image-guided proton therapy. Neurological and ear nose throat symptoms were collected in addition to audiometric testing, before and after the treatment. Acute and late toxicities were assessed according to the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events (CTCAE) v4. Median age at diagnosis was 52.6years (range: 18.2-65.8years). Proton therapy was the exclusive treatment in six patients and four patients had a postoperative radiotherapy. Median dose was 50.4Gy relative biological effectiveness (RBE; range: 45.0-67.0Gy). With a median follow-up of 24.6months (range: 6.7-46.2 months), local tumour control rate was 100% (stable, n=10). No upper grade 2 acute toxicity was reported. To the latest news, seven patients had controlled symptoms (improved, n=1, stabilized, n=6). One patient out of seven with initial tinnitus had a decrease in his symptoms, while the six other patients had a sustained stabilization. Proton beam therapy is an effective and well-tolerated treatment modality of skull base paragangliomas, with documented functional benefit. A longer follow-up is planned in order to assess local control and long-term toxicities.

However, properly qualified and trained radiation therapists might be capable to perform image registration. We evaluated in our centre the capability and accuracy of radiation therapists to validate positioning images in a prospective study. A total of 84 patients treated for prostate, head and neck, lung or breast cancer was prospectively and randomly included from July 2011 to July 2013 in radiotherapy unit of our institution. For each patient, three positioning images were randomly analysed. Two radiation oncologists analysed all positioning images and shifts decided by the radiation therapists in an independent and blinded way. The radiation oncologists had to decide whether to validate or not this shift and give a corresponding additional shift, if any. A theoretical disagreement rate less than 5% between radiation therapists and radiation oncologists was planned. A total of 240 images were analysed (head and neck: 15.0%; prostate: 14.2%; breast: 55.0%; lung: 15.8%). The global disagreement between radiation oncologists and radiation therapists for all the images analysed was 2.5% 95% confidence interval (95% CI) [1.0-5.0], corresponding to six images out of 240. A 100% agreement was reached for prostate and lung images, a 97.2% agreement for head and neck images and a 96.2% agreement for breast images. The radiation therapist validation for repositioning images seemed accurate for image-guided radiotherapy in our institution. Periodic evaluation and in-house training are warranted when routine delegation of image registration to radiation therapists is considered.

Furthermore the relationship between health education intervention methods and its correlation to complications and relapse rates require greater understanding. Patients with aryngeal cancer receiving surgery and postoperative radiotherapy were randomly divided into observation and control groups. A quality of life questionnaire was used to evaluate patients' current life quality as well as negative emotions experienced. The collected data was evaluated using the Self-rating Anxiety Scale (SAS) as well as the Self-rating Depression Scale (SDS). At the time of discharge, patients' satisfaction on nursing and perception of health knowledge was assessed. Three and six months after discharge, patients were given follow-up visits and questionnaire surveys to evaluate their rehabilitation. This was done in relation with the Morningside Rehabilitation Stats Scale (MRSS), incidence of complications and recurrence. The scores of negative emotions, exhibited during the study, were lower in the observation group than in the control group. A month after discharge had a positive correlation to improved quality of life. This was highlighted in the observation group in comparison with the control group. The data collected following discharge revealed an improvement in quality of life, compared with that at the time of admission. Compared with the control group, the SAS and SDS scores in the observation group were decreased a month after discharge. Compared with the scores on admission, the SAS and SDS scores in both groups were decreased one month after discharge. The observation group had a lower incidence of complications than that of the control group. Six months after discharge, in the observation group, the MRSS score was lower than before discharge while in the control group, the MRSS score was higher than before discharge. Health education intervention can significantly improve the quality of life and reduce experiences relating to negative emotion in patients with laryngeal cancer. This improvement was seen following surgery and radiotherapy. Additionally effective reduction rates in the incidence of postoperative complications and recurrence were exhibited following methods of health education intervention.

Big data offers the capacities, in the field of health, to accelerate the discoveries and to optimize the management of patients by combining a large volume of data and the creation of therapeutic models. In radiotherapy, the development of big data is attractive because data are very numerous et heterogeneous (demographics, radiomics, genomics, radiogenomics, etc.). The expectation would be to predict the effectiveness and tolerance of radiation therapy. With these new concepts, still at the preliminary stage, it is possible to create a personalized medicine which is always more secure and reliable.","564":"The role played by radiation therapy after pleurectomy\/decortication or surgical biopsy in malignant pleural mesothelioma is uncertain. We treated patients with accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy using helical tomotherapy and intensity-modulated arc therapy in an attempt to keep lung toxicity to a minimum. The present study reports the feasibility and toxicity of this approach. Between 2008 and 2012, 36 patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma underwent accelerated hypofractionated radiotherapy to the hemithorax after pleurectomy\/decortication (19 patients) or biopsy (17 patients). The prescription dose was 25Gy in five fractions over 5 consecutive days. We observed three patients with G3 pneumonitis, five cases of grade 2 dyspnea and six cases of grade 2 cough. The median follow-up was 37 months (range: 3-54 months). The median overall survival for patients who underwent pleurectomy\/decortication followed by radiotherapy was 21.6 months [95% confidence interval (95% CI): 15.5-24.1] compared to 19.4 months for patients not submitted to surgery. Treatment of intact lung with pleural intensity-modulated arc irradiation in malignant pleural mesothelioma patients with malignant pleural mesothelioma proved safe and feasible, with an acceptable rate of pneumonitis. Survival rates were encouraging for both biopsy-only and pleurectomy\/decortication groups.

Surgical resection has been reported by number of authors as a valuable option to improve disease control, in particular in patients with limited disease burden and favourable histotypes; however, the benefit of this procedure has been questioned due to patient selection, technical challenges and relevant risk of perioperative mortality and severe complications. In the present study, a cohort of surgically unfit patients affected by a solitary metastasis in the pancreas from various primary tumours received stereotactic radiotherapy with an ablative dose schedule, obtaining promising local and distant disease progression-free delay with minor toxicity.

These occult failures are more and more frequently diagnosed at an early stage, thanks to targeted biopsies and advances in imaging modalities, such as multiparametric MRI and PET-CT. Salvage brachytherapy benefits from the implantation accuracy of brachytherapy procedures using 3D dosimetry and has resulted in more than 50% tumour control rates with long-term. Incontinence rates are always below those of other salvage treatments such as radical prostatectomy, HIFU or cryotherapy. Today, a consensus has been reached to better define good candidates for salvage brachytherapy with respect to disease characteristics at baseline and at failure. No consensus has been clearly defined yet regarding the choice of the technique (low or high dose rate), the total dose to be delivered, or the volume to be implanted (whole gland or focal). While we await robust data from recently completed phase II studies and given the heterogeneous results in the literature, this technique (although already included in the last 2016 NCCN guidelines) remains to be precisely evaluated, optimally within the frame of controlled trials.","569":"The liver is an essential organ that ensures many vital functions such as metabolism of bilirubin, glucose, lipids, synthesis of coagulation factors, destruction of many toxins, etc. The hepatic parenchyma can be irradiated during the management of digestive tumors, right basithoracic, esophagus, abdomen in toto or TBI. In addition, radiotherapy of the hepatic area, which is mainly stereotactic, now occupies a central place in the management of primary or secondary hepatic tumors. Irradiation of the whole liver, or part of it, may be complicated by radiation-induced hepatitis. It is therefore necessary to respect strict dosimetric constraints both in stereotactic and in conformational irradiation in order to limit the undesired irradiation of the hepatic parenchyma which may vary according to the treatment techniques, the basic hepatic function or the lesion size. The liver is an organ with a parallel architecture, so the average tolerable dose in the whole liver should be considered rather than the maximum tolerable dose at one point. The purpose of this article is to propose a development of dose recommendations during conformation or stereotactic radiotherapy of the liver.","570":null,"571":"The management of localized prostate cancer has been marked over these last years by the importance of Active Surveillance for low risk forms. Indeed, the long follow-up and the quality of the results are now sufficient to offer this option even in relatively young people. However, the question is still under investigation concerning intermediate risk of prostate cancer. Patients' selection and follow-up management are of very high importance. Another major evolution is the robotic assistance for radical prostatectomy. Even if the level of evidence is still low, the global utilization all over the world of robotic assistance is a major fact of these last years mostly explained by the difficulty to correctly perform manual laparoscopic surgical procedure. Lastly, the focal therapy of prostate cancer is a new concept. The development of this approach is authorized by the improvement of the quality of prostate MRI and the accuracy of prostate biopsy. Presently, the focal treatment has to be performed in clinical trials or maybe with the help of national database validated by all the actors concerned by the treatment of prostate cancer.","572":"The treatment of rectal carcinoma is based on multidisciplinary strategy and multimodal approaches including gastrointestinal tract specialists, medical oncologists, radiation oncologists and surgery. The different objectives should be declined according to the characteristics of the tumours. The aim of the therapist would be to select the best strategy offering to the patient to be cured with as less as possible late adverse toxicity. The challenge of the treatment of small tumours is to maintain a functional anal sphincter while minimizing the risk of local recurrence. The standard treatment of locally advanced disease is aiming firstly to cure the patient and secondly to prevent late complications. Each of these clinical presentations of the disease has to be considered as a whole taking into account the new surgical techniques and a personalized approach adapted to the tumour. Nowadays they should be studied with dedicated clinical trials.","573":"The cooperation between radiation oncologist and medical physicist is essential to guarantee the quality and safety of the irradiation of our patients. It would be wrong to consider that the intervention of medical physicists in the patient management process is limited to the provision of calibrated and controlled equipment and to guarantee the validity of the dose distribution and the treatment time, while the radiation oncologist has the complete control of all clinical activities related to irradiation. The intervention of physicists at the stage of acquisition of anatomical data and throughout the phase of optimization of the treatment is already a reality. The recognition of the profession of medical physicist as a health profession comes to legitimize this intervention. Should physician-physicist cooperation be limited to these common tasks and participation in continuing care? Can we envisage a true synergy of action that goes beyond the field of care? The answer to the question: what does the physicist expect from the radiation oncologist and vice versa may bring elements to reinforce tomorrow's cooperation. This article is the second part of the question.","574":null,"575":"For some years now, we have entered the genomic age of tumour genotyping from a medical point of view. Technological breakthroughs in both biology and information science now allow a genomic analysis of cancers in everyday medical practice with, in some case, a major impact on patient care not only for the choice of therapy (i.e. EGFR mutations in lung adenocarcinoma), but also for diagnosis and monitoring of the disease. Tumour genotyping is performed from formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded tissues used for diagnosis of cancer. However, new approaches have emerged, with for example the more and more spread use of \"liquid biopsies\". Genotyping of a gene panel implicated in carcinogenesis is now routinely performed in some cancer types, with the help of high-throughput sequencers, and it is likely that improvement of these machines will make tumour genotyping easier and more accessible in the near future.

Nowadays, modern radiotherapy techniques make it possible to shorten treatment time with hypofractionation, to better protect surrounding healthy tissues and to escalate the dose even further. Advances in radiotherapy are closely linked to advances in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and\/or PET imaging. Functional imaging makes it possible to deliver personalised pelvic nodal radiotherapy, targeting the nodal areas at higher risk of microscopic involvement. In patients with an index lesion at baseline or at failure, MR-based focal therapy or focal dose escalation with brachytherapy or stereotactic body radiation therapy is also currently investigated. MR-based adaptive radiotherapy, which makes it possible to track prostate shifts during radiation delivery, is another step forward in the integration of MR imaging in radiation delivery.","578":null,"579":"The question whether a reirradiation is possible, with either curative of palliative intent, is a frequent issue and a true therapeutic challenge, in particular for a critical organ sensitive to cumulative dose, such as the spinal cord. Preclinical experimental data, based on debatable models that are hardly transferable to patients, suggest that there is a possibility of reirradiation, beyond the classical threshold for dose constraints, taking into account the \"time-dose factor\". Although the underlying biological mechanisms are however uncertain, scarce clinical data seem to confirm that the tolerance of spinal cord to reirradiation does exist, provided that a particular attention to total dose is given. In the context where modern stereotactic irradiation facilities expand therapeutic perspectives, we review the literature on possibilities of reirradiation, through the example of spinal cord reirradiation.","580":"Thanks to the improvement in radiotherapy physics, biology, computing and imaging, patients presenting with liver tumors can be efficiently treated by radiation. Radiotherapy has been included in liver tumors treatment guidelines at all disease stages. Liver stereotactic radiotherapy has to be preferred to standard fractionated radiotherapy whenever possible, as potentially more efficient because of higher biological equivalent dose. Liver stereotactic radiotherapy planning and delivery require extensive experience and optimal treatment quality at every step, thus limiting its availability to specialized centres. Multicentre studies are difficult to develop due to a large technical heterogeneity. Respiratory management, image guidance and immobilization are considerations as important as machine type. The use of multimodal planning imaging is compulsory to achieve expected contouring quality. Treatment efficacy is difficult to assess following liver stereotactic radiotherapy, but local control is high and toxicity unusual. As a consequence, liver stereotactic radiotherapy is part of multimodal and multidisciplinary management of liver tumors.","581":"Radiation-induced lung disease (RILD) is common after radiation therapy and represents cornerstone toxicities after treatment of thoracic malignancies. From a review of literature, the objective of this article was to summarize clinical and non-clinical parameters associated with the risk of RILD in the settings of normo-fractionated radiotherapy and stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). For the treatment of lung cancers with a normo-fractionated treatment, the mean lung dose (MLD) should be below 15-20Gy. For a thoracic SBRT, V20Gy&lt;10% and MLD&lt;6Gy are recommended. One should pay attention to central tumors and respect specific dose constraints to the bronchial tree. The recent technological improvements may represent an encouraging way to decrease lung toxicities. Finally, our team developed a calculator in order to predict the risk of radiation pneumonitis.","582":"Radiotherapy of abdominopelvic primary or secondary lesions in conformational or stereotactic techniques is in full development. The small bowel is highly sensitive to irradiation and is the main organ at risk limiting prescription doses. This literature review aims to define the dose constraints to the small bowel and the duodenum in conformational and stereotactic body radiotherapy. The small bowel including the duodenum, jejunum and ileum is delineated on the simulation scanner. The radio-induced intestinal toxicities are acute related to the cellular depopulation of the intestinal mucosa, and late of more complex pathophysiology associating depletion in stem cells, microangiopathy, chronic inflammation and fibrosis. The main predictive factor of intestinal toxicity is the dose-volume ratio. In conformational radiotherapy, the dose constraints to the duodenum are: V25Gy&lt;45% and V35Gy&lt;20%. The jejunum and ileum dose constraints are for delineation by intestinal loop or peritoneal cavity respectively: V15Gy&lt;275mL or V15Gy&lt;830mL and V45Gy&lt;150mL. In stereotactic body radiotherapy, small bowel dose constraints depend on fractionation and are defined on a small volume and on a maximum dose at one point. Intestinal toxicity is also dependent on factors intrinsic to the patient and radiosensitizers such as targeted therapies or chemotherapies. With the development of new techniques allowing dose escalation on the tumour and the development of inverse planning, the definition of dose constraints to the small bowel is essential for current practice.","583":"Bladder dose constraints in case of conformational radiotherapy\/intensity-modulated radiotherapy and stereotactic radiotherapy are reported from the literature, in particular from the French radiotherapy society RECORAD recommendations, according to the treated pelvic tumor sites.

In case of high-dose prostate cancer radiotherapy, the bladder dose constraints are: V60Gy&lt;50% and maximum dose&lt;80Gy for standard fractionation and V60Gy&lt;5%, V48Gy&lt;25% and V41Gy&lt;50% for moderate hypofractionation (20 fractions of 3Gy). In case of prostate stereotactic radiotherapy (five fractions of 7.25Gy), the most frequent dose constraints in the literature are V37Gy&lt;10cm3 and V18Gy&lt;40%.

A sequential treatment combining induction chemotherapy with docetaxel, cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil (TPF), followed by (chemo)radiotherapy is frequently used as part of laryngeal preservation strategies. Apart from this particular situation, the benefit in terms of survival of induction chemotherapy has been much discussed in recent years. In five recent randomized trials, chemoradiotherapy was compared with TPF induction chemotherapy followed by chemoradiotherapy. Of these five trials, four concluded that these treatments were similar. A single trial reports a benefit for induction chemotherapy but its methodology is highly debatable. After TPF chemotherapy, chemoradiotherapy is less well tolerated. In patients with significant lymph node invasion (N2b-c-N3), induction chemotherapy reduces the occurrence of distant metastasis. The HPV status should not influence the therapeutic decision.","589":"The absence of exit dose and the sharp lateral penumbra are key assets for proton therapy, which are responsible for its dosimetric superiority over advanced photon radiotherapy. Dosimetric comparisons have consistently shown a reduction of the integral dose and the dose to organs at risk favouring intensity-modulated proton therapy (IMPT) over intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The structures that benefit the most of these dosimetric improvements in head and neck cancers are the anterior oral cavity, the posterior fossa, the visual apparatus and swallowing structures. A number of publications have concluded that these dosimetric differences actually translate into reduced toxicities with IMPT, for example with regards to reduced weight loss or need for feeding tube. Patient survival is usually similar to IMRT series, except in base of skull or sinonasal malignancies, where a survival advantage of IMPT could exist. The goals of the present review is to describe the major characteristics of proton therapy, to analyse the clinical data with regards to head and neck cancer patients, and to highlight the issue of patient selection and physical and biological uncertainties.","590":null,"591":"Radiation therapy of breast cancer, Hodgkin lymphoma, lung cancer and others thoracic irradiations induce an ionizing radiation dose to the heart. Irradiation of the heart, associated with patient cardiovascular risk and cancer treatment-induced cardiotoxicity, increase cardiovascular mortality. The long survival after breast or Hodgkin lymphoma irradiation requires watching carefully late treatment toxicity. The over-risk of cardiac events is related to the dose received by the heart and the irradiated cardiac volume. The limitation of cardiac irradiation should be a priority in the planning of thoracic irradiations. Practices have to be modified, using modern techniques to approach of the primary objective of radiotherapy which is to optimize the dose to the target volume, sparing healthy tissues, in this case the heart. We have reviewed the literature on cardiac toxicity induced by conformational tridimensional radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy or stereotactic body radiation therapy, in order to evaluate the possibilities to limit cardiotoxicity. Finally, we summarise the recommendations on dose constraints to the heart and coronary arteries.","592":"Reimbursement of radiotherapy in Germany is mainly based on a certain fixed fee for treatment planning and patient set up in addition to payment per fraction. This applies to outpatient care for patients with public health insurance or private health insurance. Payment per fraction has a considerable influence on reimbursement of inpatients as well. The advantage of payment per fraction is the simplicity and transparency. The disadvantage is an inadequate reimbursement for new treatment modalities like hypofractionation or stereotactic body radiotherapy.","593":null,"594":"Induction chemotherapy must be integrated in a global approach for locally advanced head and neck cancer. Its use has theoretical advantages but should not compromise locoregional radiotherapy. Induction chemotherapy is a standard for organ preservation with the use of the TPF scheme to avoid total laryngectomy without compromising survival data. It is more controversial in other locally advanced head and neck cancer because concurrent chemoradiotherapy is the standard of care. It may be an option for patients with significant lymph node invasion to reduce the occurrence of distant metastasis.","595":"The arrival of immunotherapy has profoundly changed the management of multiple cancers, obtaining unexpected tumour responses. However, until now, the majority of patients do not respond to these new treatments. The identification of biomarkers to determine precociously responding patients is a major challenge. Computational medical imaging (also known as radiomics) is a promising and rapidly growing discipline. This new approach consists in the analysis of high-dimensional data extracted from medical imaging, to further describe tumour phenotypes. This approach has the advantages of being non-invasive, capable of evaluating the tumour and its microenvironment in their entirety, thus characterising spatial heterogeneity, and being easily repeatable over time. The end goal of radiomics is to determine imaging biomarkers as decision support tools for clinical practice and to facilitate better understanding of cancer biology, allowing the assessment of the changes throughout the evolution of the disease and the therapeutic sequence. This review will develop the process of computational imaging analysis and present its potential in immuno-oncology.","596":"Dramatic progress has deeply moved rectal cancer management. Tailoring of treatment allow to select participants according to initial prognostic factors (radiotherapist) or tumoral response (surgeon). Today, this management must keep in mind tumoral initial staging, prognostic at the time of diagnosis, tumoral response and characteristic, and patient's motivation. The result of this patient care is more than oncologic, it is also functional.","597":"Brachytherapy as sole treatment is standard of care for D'Amico classification low-risk prostate cancer. For intermediate and high-risk patients, brachytherapy can be associated to external beam radiation therapy to better take into account the risk of extracapsular effraction and\/or seminal vesicle involvement. Three randomized studies have shown that this association increases freedom from relapse survival compared to exclusive external beam radiation therapy. This benefit is not shown for overall survival. The addition of a hormonal therapy to this association is most likely mandatory for high-risk patients, and needs to be confirmed for intermediate risk patients. Both high-dose rate and low-dose rate brachytherapy are suitable with similar biochemical disease free survival rates. High-dose rate brachytherapy seems to have a better genitourinary tolerance profile, while low-dose rate brachytherapy is an easier process and has a more widespread expertise.","598":"Therapeutic principles of radiation therapy in head and neck carcinomas will be discussed in this review. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy with concomitant cisplatin should be standard. In case of contraindication to chemotherapy, cetuximab is an option, while hyperfractionation should be considered in patients unfit for concomitant treatment. Concomitant chemotherapy should be administered in the presence of extracapsular extensions and positive margins in the postoperative setting. Current research areas such as desescalation in human papillomavirus-positive tumours, adaptive radiotherapy, radiomics and immunotherapy will also be addressed.","599":"For prostate cancer, hypofractionation has been based since 1999 on radiobiological data, which calculated a very low alpha\/beta ratio (1.2 to 1.5Gy). This suggested that a better local control could be obtained, without any toxicity increase. Consequently, two types of hypofractionated schemes were proposed: \"moderate\" hypofractionation, with fractions of 2.5 to 4Gy, and \"extreme\" hypofractionation, utilizing stereotactic techniques, with fractions of 7 to 10Gy. For moderate hypofractionation, the linear-quadratic (LQ) model has been used to calculate the equivalent doses of the new protocols. The available trials have often shown a \"non-inferiority\", but no advantage, while the equivalent doses calculated for the hypofractionated arms were sometimes very superior to the doses of the conventional arms. This finding could suggest either an alpha\/beta ratio lower than previously calculated, or a negative impact of other radiobiological parameters, which had not been taken into account. For \"extreme\" hypofractionation, the use of the LQ model is discussed for high dose fractions. Moreover, a number of radiobiological questions are still pending. The reduced overall irradiation time could be either a positive point (better local control) or a negative one (reduced reoxygenation). The prolonged duration of the fractions could lead to a decrease of efficacy (because allowing for reparation of sublethal lesions). Finally, the impact of the large fractions on the microenvironment and\/or immunity remains discussed. The reported series appear to show encouraging short to mid-term results, but the results of randomized trials are still awaited. Today, it seems reasonable to only propose those extreme hypofractionated schemes to well-selected patients, treating small volumes with high-level stereotactic techniques.","600":"The cooperation between radiation oncologists and physicists is essential to guarantee the quality and safety of the irradiation of our patients. It would be wrong to consider that the intervention of physicists in the patient management process is limited to the provision of calibrated and controlled equipment and to guarantee the validity of the dose distribution and the treatment time, while the radiation oncologist has the complete control of all clinical activities related to irradiation. The intervention of physicists at the stage of acquisition of anatomical data and throughout the phase of optimization of the treatment is already a reality. The recognition of the profession of medical physicist as a health profession comes to legitimize this intervention. Should physician-physicist cooperation be limited to these common tasks and participation in continuing care? Can we consider a true synergy of action that goes beyond the field of care? The answer to the question: \"what does the radiation oncologist expect from the physicist and inversely?\" may bring elements to reinforce tomorrow's cooperation.","601":null,"602":"Several prospective studies have demonstrated the safety of active surveillance as a first treatment of prostate cancer. It spares many patients of a useless treatment, with its potential sequelae. Patients with a low-risk cancer are all candidates for this approach, as recommended by the American Society of Clinical Oncology (ASCO). Some patients with an intermediate risk could be also concerned by active surveillance, but this is still being discussed. Currently, the presence of grade 4 lesions on biopsy is a contra-indication. Modalities included a repeated prostate specific antigen test and systematic rebiopsy during the first year after diagnosis. MRI is now proposed to better select patients at inclusion and also during surveillance. No life style changes or drugs are significantly associated with a longer duration of surveillance.","603":"Based on recent, important publications on the impact of brachytherapy in the management of prostate cancer, we analysed already validated indications and the \"under investigations\" use of brachytherapy. Published studies (MEDLINE), randomized trials and recommendations were reviewed, as well as Delphi consensus when available. While low-dose rate brachytherapy remains a standard of care for low-risk eligible patients, three randomized trials are now available to consider that combination of external beam radiation therapy with brachytherapy boost (low- or high-dose rate) appears as a recommended treatment for intermediate and high-risk patients. Other indications of prostate brachytherapy (monotherapy and salvage) remain under evaluation. For low-risk patients with good urinary status, low-dose rate brachytherapy alone should be offered. For low-intermediate risk prostate cancer, low-dose rate brachytherapy alone may be offered as monotherapy, while for high-intermediate risk prostate cancer, a combination of external beam radiation therapy (with or without androgen deprivation therapy) plus brachytherapy boost (low- or high-dose rate) should be offered to eligible patients. For patients with high-risk prostate cancer receiving external beam radiation therapy and androgen deprivation therapy, brachytherapy boost (low- or high-dose rate) should be offered to eligible patients. High-dose rate brachytherapy as monotherapy (single dose for low-risk\/multifractionated for intermediate and high-risk) must be explored under clinical investigations, as well as salvage brachytherapy for local recurrence.","604":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is one of the leading causes of cancer mortality worldwide. The prognosis for patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma has not substantially improved during the last decades, despite numerous advancements in treatment options. Reliable markers for early tumour detection and treatment response, which complement clinical examinations, imaging techniques, and biopsies would be extremely useful. One fairly new and promising method is the analysis of tumour-derived cell-free DNA (ctDNA) in the plasma of cancer patients. First data indicate that this method may assist, in the future, in the early detection of head and neck squamous cell carcinoma, the real-time monitoring of the disease course, the therapy response, and the prediction of prognosis with direct therapeutic implications by determining the best therapeutic modality for patient care.","605":"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for primary and metastatic hepatic malignancies can be performed in association and\/or as an alternative to surgery and radiofrequency. The consequences of the great number of techniques available are heterogeneity in contouring, dose prescription and in determination of dose constraints for organs at risk. The objective of this paper is to improve the quality and safety and to help the diffusion of this technique for a majority of patients. In 2016, the French Society of Radiation Oncology (SFRO) published guidelines for external radiotherapy and brachytherapy (\"Recorad\"). This paper is an update of these recommendations considering recent publications.","606":"Locoregional relapse in previously irradiated region for head and neck tumours is associated with a bad locoregional and distant prognosis. Reirradiation might be exclusive, or feasible in addition with surgery and\/or chemotherapy, according to histopronostic factors. Data show that reirradiation is feasible with some severe toxicity due to the bad prognosis of this situation. Hyperfractionnated regimen with split course or normofractionnated regimen without split course are possible with similar efficacy. If tumour size is small, stereotactic ablative radiotherapy may be considered, and if the treatment centre has proton therapy, it could be proposed because of better organs at risk sparing. There is no standard regarding reirradiation schedules and several trials have to be done in order to determine the best technique. Nevertheless, it is agreed that a total dose of 60Gy (2Gy per fraction) is needed. Other trials testing the association with new systemic agents have to be performed, among them agents targeting the PD1\/PD-L1 axis.","607":"In order to reduce the incidence of major accidents during external radiotherapy treatment, \"never events\" checklists have been incorporated into the \"record and verify\" system. This article details this process. Prospects for improvement are also proposed, including a peer-to-peer audit on the use of checklists and the availability of the radiotherapy information system manufacturer to collaborate in this process to secure the patients' journey.","608":null,"609":"In patients undergoing external radiation therapy, bone marrow and cortical bone structures are all often neglected as organs at risk. Still, from increased febrile neutropenia risk in patients undergoing chemoradiation for a pelvic tumour to increased risk of vertebral fracture when undergoing hypofractioned stereotactic radiotherapy of a spinal metastasis, adverse effects are frequent and sometimes serious. This literature review first defines the rules for contouring these structures, then the dose constraints currently recommended. This article focuses first on conventional irradiation or intensity modulation radiotherapy considering classical fractionation. Secondly, it focuses on stereotactic radiotherapy. The considered organs will be haematopoietic structures, and bone cortical structures. Current recommendations are summarised in a table.","610":null,"611":null,"612":"MRI-based radiotherapy planning is a topical subject due to the introduction of a new generation of treatment machines combining a linear accelerator and a MRI. One of the issues for introducing MRI in this task is the lack of information to provide tissue density information required for dose calculation. To cope with this issue, two strategies may be distinguished from the literature. Either a synthetic CT scan is generated from the MRI to plan the dose, or a dose is generated from the MRI based on physical underpinnings. Within the first group, three approaches appear: bulk density mapping assign a homogeneous density to different volumes of interest manually defined on a patient MRI; machine learning-based approaches model local relationship between CT and MRI image intensities from multiple data, then applying the model to a new MRI; atlas-based approaches use a co-registered training data set (CT-MRI) which are registered to a new MRI to create a pseudo CT from spatial correspondences in a final fusion step. Within the second group, physics-based approaches aim at computing the dose directly from the hydrogen contained within the tissues, quantified by MRI. Excepting the physics approach, all these methods generate a synthetic CT called \"pseudo CT\", on which radiotherapy planning will be finally realized. This literature review shows that atlas- and machine learning-based approaches appear more accurate dosimetrically. Bulk density approaches are not appropriate for bone localization. The fastest methods are machine learning and the slowest are atlas-based approaches. The less automatized are bulk density assignation methods. The physical approaches appear very promising methods. Finally, the validation of these methods is crucial for a clinical practice, in particular in the perspective of adaptive radiotherapy delivered by a linear accelerator combined with an MRI scanner.","613":"Adrenal glands are a common site for metastatic spread since they represent the fourth metastatic site of solid tumors. Interest in local ablative treatments of oligometastases is growing since literature suggests better progression-free survival, quality of life and potentially overall survival in selected patients. Surgery remains the first treatment of adrenal oligometastases because results are good, with a long enough follow-up. However, stereotactic radiotherapy appears to be comparable to surgery and could be proposed to elderly, unfit, inoperable patients, or even to patients whose systemic treatment should not be suspended for too long. This article aims to present a review of published studies to date on stereotactic radiotherapy of adrenal metastases and to propose a treatment protocol.","614":null,"615":"After stereotactic radiation therapy for brain metastases, one of the complications is radionecrosis. Differential diagnosis with tumour recurrence can be helped by different methods of imaging, although histology remains the gold standard. According to the treatment centres, practice diverges. The objective of this single-centre retrospective study was to define the power of MRI, PET scan and NMR spectroscopy to establish a decision tree. This study included patients who underwent stereotactic radiation therapy for brain metastases, and required, during follow-up, both a PET scan and NMR spectroscopy in order to differentiate a radiation necrosis and tumour recurrence. From 2010 to 2015, 25 patients were consistent with these criteria. Conventional MRI technique, with the T1\/T2 mismatch criterion, had a specificity of 75% and a sensitivity of only 44%. A lesion quotient greater than 0.3 diagnosed a recurrence with a sensitivity of 92%. PET scan combined the best sensitivity and specificity, respectively of 92% and 69%. Whatever the thresholds used in NMR spectroscopy for choline\/N-acetylaspartate and choline\/creatin ratios, the power of this imaging modality did not exceed that of PET scan. The criteria described in conventional MRI cannot by themselves establish the differential diagnosis. In first intention in case of doubt, PET scan should be done, combining the best sensitivity and specificity, whereas NMR spectroscopy used in combination does not improve these factors. ","616":"Radiation-induced lung injuries mainly include the (acute or sub-acute) radiation pneumonitis, the lung fibrosis and the bronchiolitis obliterans organizing pneumonia (BOOP). The present review aims at describing the diagnostic process, the current physiopathological knowledge, and the available (non dosimetric) preventive and curative treatments. Radiation-induced lung injury is a diagnosis of exclusion, since clinical, radiological, or biological pathognomonic evidences do not exist. Investigations should necessarily include a thoracic high resolution CT-scan and lung function tests with a diffusing capacity of the lung for carbon monoxide. No treatment ever really showed efficacy to prevent acute radiation-induced lung injury, or to treat radiation-induced lung fibrosis. The most promising drugs in order to prevent radiation-induced lung injury are amifostine, angiotensin-converting-enzyme inhibitors and pentoxifylline. Inhibitors of collagen synthesis are currently tested at a pre-clinical stage to limit the radiation-induced lung fibrosis. Regarding available treatments of radiation-induced pneumonitis, corticoids can be considered the cornerstone. However, no standardized program or guidelines concerning the initial dose and the gradual tapering have been scientifically established. Alternative treatments can be prescribed, based on clinical cases reporting on the efficacy of immunosuppressive drugs. Such data highlight the major role of the lung dosimetric protection in order to efficiently prevent radiation-induced lung injury.","617":"To specify the effectiveness of head and neck cancer reirradiation and make a synthesis of prognostic factors established by published series of patients. Original series of external reirradiation of head and neck cancer with at least ten patients were sought in Medline database. Exclusive reirradiation with or without concurrent chemotherapy offers 11 months of median overall survival, versus 6 months for chemotherapy alone, and 20 to 40% of the patients are still alive two years after treatment. Postoperative reirradiation allows 3 years overall survival from 40 to 60%. However, side effects of grade 3 or more arise in more than half of patients. Patient-related good prognostic factors are male, young age, good performance status without comorbidities. Those related to the disease are low rT and rN stage, poor differentiation, other than squamous cell carcinomas and a nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal or laryngeal location. Concerning the treatment, surgical resection, a dose higher than 50 to 60Gy in a smaller-irradiated volume, an interval between the two treatments of more than 2 years and the use of an innovating technology are the most commonly highlighted prognostic factors. Concurrent chemotherapy is often associated with higher toxicity rates, without improving overall survival, unless using cisplatin for selected patients. Head and neck cancer reirradiation achieves long-term survival outcomes. However, regarding to its associated side effects, patients need to be carefully selected based on prognostic factors.

Pain flare was defined as an increase of two points in the intensity of pain on the numerical scale with no reduction in analgesic intake and\/or 25% increase of the analgesic intake without decreasing pain intensity. Primary cancer was the breast, lung and prostate in 49%, 29% and 22% of patients respectively. Twelve patients (29%) had a pain flare. No factor was significantly associated with the occurrence of this complication. A favorable analgesic response was observed in 27 patients.

We retrospectively reviewed charts from 258 patients with T1-T2N0 glottic carcinoma irradiated from April 1987 to March 2015 in four France western centers, including pretreated patients. Toxicity was analyzed according to CTCAE v4.0 classification. The median follow-up was 50 months. The median age was 67 years with 87% men and 85.5% had T1 tumor. Five years overall survival was 77.5% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 71.4-83.5), 5 years local control was 86.8% (95% CI: 82.3-91.3), specific survival rate was 95% (95% CI: 92.2-97.9) and final laryngectomy-free survival was 87.5% (95% CI: 82.2-92.9). Most toxicities were grade 1 and 2. Grade 3 acute toxicity was 15.5% for the radiation laryngitis, 3.5% for radiodermatitis and 7.7% for dysphonia. Grade 3 chronic toxicity was 3.5% for dysphonia and there were two cases of tracheal stenosis treated by tracheotomy. Radiotherapy provides good results in local control of stage I and II vocal cords cancers as well as the toxicity level. ","624":"Radiotherapy, primarily known for its cytotoxic effect on the tumor cells, via the induction of DNA damages, has the ability to induce a systemic antitumoral response. By an immunologic cell death, tumor cells exposed to radiation release a large amount of neoantigenes and pro-inflammatory mediators, acting as an in situ vaccine, resulting in an tumor regression within the primary irradiated site, but also in the distant \"out of field\" secondary tumors. However, this phenomenon is extremly rare with radiotherapy alone, suggesting that the radiation-induced antitumor immunity is not sufficient for overcoming the tumor's and its microenvironnement immunosuppressing effect. Over the last years, many scientific data and preclinical studies have demonstrated that the combination of local irradiation with immune therapy has a synergistic action in inducing an antitumoral immunity, thus enhancing an abscopal effect. In this article, we summarize the main mechanisms cancer harnesses to evade the control of the immune system and how ionising radiations can induce an antitumor immunity. A focus reports then on recent preclinical and clinical research built on this background of combined radiation and immune therapy, which bear the great potential to further improve anticancer therapies.","625":"Novel paradigms emerge in oncology today. Systemic treatments are more effective and diversified along with an increased life expectancy in oligometastatic patients. Stereotactic radiotherapy using hypofractionation opens new perspectives for local tumour control. The area of radiobiology has expanded with integration of tumour microenvironment in which radiation-induced inflammation mediators and immune system play a major role. Immunity checkpoints inhibitors experience a major development. This rapidly evolving field seems involved in the abscopal effects, especially when radiation is combined with checkpoints inhibitors, as demonstrated in numerous preclinical studies and several clinical trials. Paradoxically, irradiation also produces immunosuppressive effects. This manuscript aims to report the dual effects of ionizing radiation on the immune system and reviews some results of the combination of radiation and immunity chekpoints inhibitors and also research perspectives.","626":null,"627":null,"628":"The brain remains an uncommon site of colorectal cancer metastases. Due to the improvement of overall colorectal cancer patient survival, the incidence of brain metastases will likely rise. We report the efficacy and safety of hypofractionnated stereotactic radiation therapy and stereotactic radiosurgery, and its role in colorectal cancer brain metastasis management. Between June 2010 and December 2014, fifteen consecutive patients received hypofractionnated stereotactic radiation therapy or stereotactic radiosurgery as first local therapy or following surgical removal for colorectal cancer brain metastases. The primary endpoint was overall survival. Secondary endpoints were brain progression free survival, in field control rates and safety. Median follow-up was 41 months (95% confidence interval [CI]: [8.9-73.1 months]), median overall survival was 8 months (95% CI [4.7-11.3 months]), and median brain progression-free survival was 5 months (95% CI [3.9-6.1 months]). Five in field recurrences were observed, which makes a control rate per metastases at 6 and 12 months of 77.8% (95% CI [74.34%-81.26%]), 51.9% (95% CI [44.21%-59.59%]) respectively. Over the 19 treatment sequences, five in field recurences were observed: 6, 12 and 18 months control rate per treatment sequence were 93.3% (95% CI [90.42%-96.18%]), 68.1% (95% CI [62.03%-74.17%]) and 45.4% (95% CI [36.14%-54.66%]) respectively. Immediate tolerance was good with no toxicity grade III or more. Long-term toxicity included two radionecrosis among which, one was symptomatic.

Fifty-nine patients treated with definitive radiotherapy for early glottic cancer between 2003 and 2011 were enrolled. We evaluated the SUVmax in the region of interest around the original tumour site. Local tumour control and survival were estimated using Kaplan-Meier curves. Receiver operating characteristic curves were used to assess the optimal SUVmax cut-off for predicting local control. As determined by laryngoscopy, all patients achieved a complete response. Eleven patients experienced local recurrence, while no distant metastasis occurred. One patient died due to local recurrence, while five lost their larynxes. The median follow-up was 61.5 (range: 6.2-123.4) months. The five-year local progression-free survival was 84.7%, and larynx preservation was possible in 89.6% of cases. The median SUVmax was 2.2. The optimal SUVmax for predicting local tumour control was identified as 3.4. Patients with glottic cancers with an SUVmax&gt;3.4 showed a significantly lower local progression-free survival rate than those with tumours with an SUVmax&lt;3.4 (five-year local progression-free survival rate: 53.4% vs. 95.4%, P&lt;0.01). Multivariate analysis confirmed that a high SUVmax was an independent predictive factor for local progression-free survival (P=0.006). The use of (18F)-fluorodeoxyglucose-positron emission tomography for evaluation of the SUVmax is useful to predict local progression-free survival in patients with early glottic cancer treated by radiation.

In the present work, we demonstrate by Monte Carlo simulations the impact of radiation energy on absorbed dose in a lung tumor and in other secondary organs in a digital mouse. We also report the energy difference between simulations of monoenergetic and spectral radiations, and between CT-based and atlas-made digital mouse. We simulated seven monoenergetic and spectral radiation beams from 50keV (or kVp) to 450keV (or kVp). For each energy mode, the beams were generated along seven angles converging on the tumor. We assessed the absorbed dose in ten volumes including the lungs, the heart and the spine. The results showed an increase of absorbed dose as a function of energy with a lowest dose at 100keV. In the secondary organs not traversed by the beams, the spinal cord received doses of 0.78% and 0.07%, and the spinal bone received 2.36% and 0.35% relative to those in the tumor, respectively at 50keV and at 450keV. A region in the heart not traversed by the beams received 2% of the dose to the tumor. The optimal energy to the tumor with relatively reduced doses to other organs was achieved at energies around 200keV. At these energies, the surrounding of the tumor received lesser doses. Monoenergetic radiations were found to be more appropriate to target the tumor than spectral radiations produced by X-ray tubes, and CT-based digital mouse was more realistic than atlas-based mouse since it accounts for tissue heterogeneity.

Exceptionally, radiotherapy may induce, by isomorphic reaction or Koebner's phenomenon, some specific dermatosis. In this article, we report five new observations of these unusual complications of radiation therapy, occurring in very variable time after breast irradiation and remaining strictly localized in the irradiated field (cutaneous mastocytosis, Sweet syndrome, lichen planus, vitiligo). These cases emphasize the need to realize a systematic histological exam if any atypical skin lesion appears after radiotherapy, even long after.","638":null,"639":"Performing randomised comparative clinical trials in radiation oncology remains a challenge when new treatment modalities become available. One of the most recent examples is the lack of phase III trials demonstrating the superiority of intensity-modulated radiation therapy in most of its current indications. A new paradigm is developing that consists in the mining of large databases to answer clinical or translational issues. Beyond national databases (such as SEER or NCDB), that often lack the necessary level of details on the population studied or the treatments performed, electronic health records can be used to create detailed phenotypic profiles of any patients. In parallel, the Record-and-Verify Systems used in radiation oncology precisely document the planned and performed treatments. Artificial Intelligence and machine learning algorithms can be used to incrementally analyse these data in order to generate hypothesis to better personalize treatments. This review discusses how these methods have already been used in previous studies.","640":"Patients who undergo external beam radiotherapy are at risk of developing second tumours due to scattered radiation outside the path of the primary beam. The aim of this study was to experimentally determine the in vitro radiobiological effects of scattered radiation in cells located outside the primary photon beam and to compare this to the effects that occur in cells inside the primary beam. The comparison was performed by assessing cell viability, DNA damage, and apoptosis. Cells from the human breast cancer line MDA-MB-231 were inserted in a water phantom and irradiated at varying doses (1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0Gy). The cells were placed at two geometrical points: in the central beam axis and at 10cm out-of-field. The dose was constant in both geometrical points. Survival fraction, number of DNA double strand-breaks, and cleaved poly-(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) levels were determined by clonogenic assay and flow cytometry. A slight, non-significant decrease of 3 to 5% in cell survival fraction was observed in cells irradiated outside the primary field. The number of PARP-positive cells and DNA double strand-breaks both increased after out-of-field irradiation. Scattered irradiation appears to induce an in vitro biological response on out-of-field cells that is stronger than the effect of primary radiation on in-field cells, independent of the bystander effect. These findings suggest that the biological response of healthy tissues outside the primary beam might be higher than previously believed.

The median nadir prostate specific antigen (PSA) serum concentration after brachytherapy was 1.29ng\/mL (0.6-2.1ng\/mL), obtained after a median of 12 months (7-21 months). The average [PSA] before robotic salvage prostatectomy was 6.60ng\/mL (4.17-13.80ng\/mL). [PSA] at 1 and 3 months after prostatectomy was less than 0.05ng\/mL in five patients. [PSA] remained below 0.05ng\/mL for six patients at 12 and 24 months. One month after robotic salvage prostatectomy, all patients had at least partial urinary incontinence. At 12 and 24 months after robotic salvage prostatectomy four patients have regained full urinary continence. In terms of erectile function at 24 months, three patients retained erectile function with possible sexual intercourse. Robotic salvage prostatectomy appears to be a reliable treatment in terms of oncological outcome with convincing results both for urinary continence and erectile function for selected patients with local recurrence after permanent brachytherapy implants.

Radiotherapy is not the sole and systematic cause of bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia. Radiation-induced should not be confused with post-radiation, dose-dependent, inflammatory pulmonary fibrosis, which is non-immunological and located within the irradiation field. The role of immunity, local inflammation and individual radiosensitivity in bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia is not well defined. Bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia represents 1% of irradiated patients with breast cancer. It results in fever (flu-like symptoms), a rather dry cough and dyspnea. In the post-radiation context, bronchiolitis obliterans with organizing pneumonia may be diagnosed several months and up to a year after breast irradiation. The treatment consists of prolonged steroids or immunosuppressants, which do not prevent chronicity in 15% of patients and death in up to 5% of cases, the remaining 80% of patients healing without sequelae.","647":"Bilateral pulmonary radiotherapy in children and young adults aims to reduce the recurrence of lung metastases. The radiation field includes liver tissue, which is sensitive to even low radiation doses. We investigated the feasibility of respiratory gating radiotherapy using voluntary deep inspiration breath hold and its toxicity in these patients. A retrospective clinical review was conducted for all patients who had undergone bilateral pulmonary radiotherapy, with or without deep inspiration breath hold, treated in our institution between October 1999 and May 2012. A dosimetric study was conducted on seven consecutive children using 4D-scan data on free-breathing and a SpiroDyn'RX-system-scan on deep inspiration breath hold. A radiation treatment of 20Gy was simulated. Concerning the clinical study, seven patients of mean age 11.9 years (range: 4.9-21.1 years) were treated with free-breathing and ten patients of mean age 15.6 years (range: 8.6-19.7 years) were treated with deep inspiration breath hold for mainly Ewing sarcoma and nephroblastoma. Within six months of radiotherapy, all patients experienced mild liver toxicity (grade 1 or 2 altered levels of alanine\/aspartate aminotransferase [n=8 of 9] or cholestasis [n=1 of 9]), which resolved completely with no difference between deep inspiration breath hold and free-breathing technique. Over a median follow-up of 2.6 years (range: 0.1-9.3 years), four patients died from disease progression (mean 1.5 years post-radiotherapy [range: 1.1-1.6 years]) and three experienced grade III-V lung toxicity. Concerning the dosimetric study, the irradiated liver volume was significantly lower with deep inspiration breath hold than free-breathing, for each isodose (V5: 73.80% versus 86.74%, P&lt;0.05; V20: 5.70% versus 26.44%, P&lt;0.05). The dosimetric data of respiratory-gated bilateral pulmonary radiotherapy showed a significantly spare of normal liver tissue. Clinical data showed that this technique is feasible even in young children. However, no liver toxicity difference between deep inspiration breath hold and free-breathing was shown.

A retrospective study was performed in a population of 23 consecutive patients between 2013 and 2015. Radiotherapy was performed on the chest area or metastatic sites during maintenance with pertuzumab and trastuzumab after six cycles of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and docetaxel. Toxicity was assessed according to the National Cancer Institute Common Toxicity Criteria version 4. Irradiation volumes were whole breast (8 patients) and chest wall (9 patients) at 50Gy in 25 fractions, the supraclavicular nodes (16 patients), the axillary area (nine patients) and the internal mammary nodes (9 patients) at 46Gy in 23 fractions. For five patients, radiotherapy was palliative: bone irradiation (4 patients), whole brain radiotherapy (one patient). Median follow-up was 12.6 months (range: 6.1-21.6 months) since the start of pertuzumab and trastuzumab. One patient presented an asymptomatic decrease of left ventricular ejection fraction below 50%. No symptomatic cardiac events were reported. Two patients presented asymptomatic grade I radiation pneumonitis. Acute skin toxicity was grade III (one patient), grade II (6 patients), and grade I (5 patients). There were two grade II esophagitis. Combination of pertuzumab, trastuzumab and radiotherapy was well tolerated, which should be confirmed by the results of larger studies. ","650":"Choroidal metastases of lung cancer are very uncommon. This localization should be suspected on blurred vision and confirmed with an ophthalmological examination. Its treatment is not entirely codified. We report a case of blurred vision secondary to bilateral choroidal metastasis in a patient with choroidal metastases from a lung adenocarcinoma, treated by intravitreal anti-vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) injection and external beam radiotherapy. According to a literature review, we analyzed the place of the targeted treatments used alone or combined with the radiotherapy.","651":"Although the large impact of Human papilloma virus (HPV) in cervical cancer is established, its place as a therapeutic target is new and according to the growing literature, could be promising. In the present study, radiosensitivity's difference based on HPV-16 variants is assessed. Variants of Human papilloma virus were identified before the exclusive radiotherapy in patients with cervical cancer. Data were prospectively collected. Fifty-nine patients were screened. Among the 59 screened patients, 34 (57.6%) were identified to be HPV-16 (+), with 13 European and two non-European variants. Of the 34 patients, 15 experienced exclusive radiotherapy. Among them, eight had complete response (seven with European and one with non-European variants), four with European variant had partial response, three with European variant had tumour persistence and one with non-European variant progressed at 3 months. No radiosensitivity difference was established, probably because of the limited population. Non-European variant aggressiveness might be suggested in accordance with the literature, as it was associated with the only tumour progression. Exclusive radiotherapy provides a unique and \"pure\" model of radioresistance in cervical cancer and could be the missing link between in vitro studies and state of the art chemoradiotherapy studies that probably feature too many parameters to identify radioresistance causes. The present study was a first step, with the future prospects of building a larger cohort study in order to better understand HPV-induced radioresistance and then to be able to propose new made-to-measure treatments. ","652":"To test if active breath control during cone-beam computed tomography (CBCT) could improve planning target volume during accelerated partial breast radiotherapy for breast cancer. Patients who were more than 40 years old, underwent breast-conserving dissection and planned for accelerated partial breast irradiation, and with postoperative staging limited to T1-2 N0 M0, or postoperative staging T2 lesion no larger than 3cm with a negative surgical margin greater than 2mm were enrolled. Patients with lobular carcinoma or extensive ductal carcinoma in situ were excluded. CBCT images were obtained pre-correction, post-correction and post-treatment. Set-up errors were recorded at left-right, anterior-posterior and superior-inferior directions. The differences between these CBCT images, as well as calculated radiation doses, were compared between patients with active breath control or free breathing. Forty patients were enrolled, among them 25 had active breath control. A total of 836 CBCT images were obtained for analysis. CBCT significantly reduced planning target volume. However, active breath control did not show significant benefit in decreasing planning target volume margin and the doses of organ-at-risk when compared to free breathing. CBCT, but not active breath control, could reduce planning target volume during accelerated partial breast irradiation. ","653":"Many Canadian institutions treat limited-disease small cell lung cancer with 40Gy in 15 fractions delivered once-a-day in 3weeks concomitantly with chemotherapy. This regimen is convenient and seems to be effective. Here, we report and compare with a literature review the outcomes of patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer treated in our institution with this hypofractionated regimen. From January 2004 to December 2012, patients with limited-stage small cell lung cancer treated curatively with platinum-based chemotherapy and concurrent thoracic radiotherapy at a dose of 40Gy in 16 fractions once-a-day were eligible for this review. Sixty-eight patients fit the analysis criteria, including ten patients with small pleural effusion. The median age was 66years old. After a median follow-up of 77months for those alive, the median survival was 28months. At 3 and 5years respectively, the locoregional control rates were 67 and 64%, while the overall survival rates were 40 and 35%. Prophylaxis cranial irradiation was delivered to 68% of the patients. Grade 2 and 3 acute esophagitis occurred in respectively 49 and 9% of the patients. There was no grade 4 radiation-induced toxicity. All patients, except for one, completed their thoracic irradiation course without interruption. Once-a-day hypofractionated radiation with concurrent chemotherapy followed by prophylactic cranial irradiation is a practical regimen. Based on our experience and the published literature, it appears to be similarly effective as regimens using twice-daily fractionation in 3weeks, or once-daily in 6 to 7weeks with higher radiotherapy doses. Further prospective comparisons of hypofractionation with the current recommendations are needed. ","654":"After stereotactic radiosurgery for a cerebral metastasis, one of the dreaded toxicities is radionecrosis. In the follow-up of these patients, it is impossible to distinguish radiation necrosis from tumour relapse either clinically or with MRI. In current practice, many imaging methods are designed such as special sequences of MRI (dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion and susceptibility-weighted imaging, diffusion), proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy, positron emission tomography, or more seldom 201-thallium single-photon emission computerized tomography.

Thirty-eight patients (International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics [FIGO] stage IB2-IVA) from four institutions received extended-field helical tomotherapy and were retrospectively evaluated. All had nodal disease. Para-aortic lymph nodes were involved in 31 patients. Patients were assessed for toxicity using version 4 of the National Cancer Institute's common terminology criteria for adverse events. Survival curves were plotted using Kaplan-Meier estimates. All patients underwent radiation to the tumor region (median dose: 45Gy; range: 44-66Gy), pelvic lymph nodes and para-aortic lymph nodes (median dose: 45Gy; range: 44-60Gy). The median dose to positive lymph nodes was 55Gy (range: 45-65Gy). All received platinum-based chemotherapy (31 concurrently). The median follow-up was 15months. Acute toxicity events observed included one patient with grade 5 febrile neutropenia, 11 patients (29%) with grade 3 hematologic complications. Grades 3-4 gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities occurred in six (16%) and four (11%) patients, respectively. Three patients had grade 3 pelvic pain (8%). The 6- and 18-month overall survival rates were 94.7 and 63.9%, respectively. The 18-month locoregional control, disease-free survival, and late grade 3 toxicity rates were 60.2, 43.3 and 7.3%, respectively. Extended-field helical tomotherapy was associated with low rates of acute gastrointestinal and genitourinary toxicities with early survival and locoregional control similar to other published series. ","656":"Treatment safety has become a priority in health policies after several incidents occurred around the world in radiation oncology departments. The aim of this study was to analyse the patients' contribution in that field and to understand which actions empower the patient in that regard. Several methods were used in a general hospital and in a comprehensive cancer centre to analyse the activities of the radiation therapists and the patients and the interactions between them: treatment session observations, semidirective interviews with radiation therapists and patients, self and alloconfrontation with radiation therapists and explanatory interviews with patients. Cooperation of the patients in treatment safety acts as an additional step that contributes to safer treatments. Radiation therapy sessions are a creative opportunity for the patient to observe, learn and analyse what is happening. Changes between treatment sessions are a source of anxiety for the patients. This study highlights the factors that favour the patients' participation. A trusting relationship and support from the health professionals can be leveraged in that manner. There is a common will shared between the patients and the health professionals towards better treatment safety. The cooperation is still not well-known and underused. This empowerment of the patient cannot be mandatory but should be promoted and developed. ","657":"Meningiomas represent the most common tumours of the central nervous system in adults. Risk factors include ionizing radiation, female hormones exposure, head trauma, cell phone use, breast cancer and family history of meningioma. Despite complete surgical resection, natural history of meningiomas often includes local recurrence but very few metastatic meningiomas have been reported. Here, we report the case of a metastatic meningioma. A 43-year-old woman was firstly treated for a symptomatic parietal meningioma WHO grade II by surgical resection followed by an irradiation of the surgical bed. After surgical resection and irradiation, the patient recovered incompletely. Two months after the end of the radiation treatment, the patient presented at the emergency unit for sciatic pain revealing bone metastases that has been histologically confirmed. Moreover, imaging led to the diagnosis of liver and lungs metastasis. Despite lack of guidelines for metastatic meningioma, few treatments have been used and published for recurrent and multiple meningioma management. In case studies, some partial responses have been seen with mifepristone and improved progression-free survival rates have been obtained with hydroxyurea and sunitinib. Metastasis in meningioma is very uncommon and no specific management has been described. Hydroxyurea, sunitinib and mifepristone could be options if no clinical trial data is available.","658":"The treatment of malignant pleural mesothelioma with radiation has always been a technical challenge. For many years, conventional radiation therapy was delivered after extrapleural pneumonectomy with acceptable results. Novel radiation treatment techniques, such as intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) were introduced, but the early experience with IMRT demonstrated troubling toxicity. Recent reports from institutions have demonstrated that with greater experience, IMRT, both in the setting of extrapleural pneumonectomy or pleurectomy, can be delivered safely. A recent study, SAKK 17\/04, questions the role of using radiation after extrapleural pneumonectomy.","659":null,"660":"The treatment of cervical cancers according to FIGO staging is well defined.

However, most French institutions propose preoperative brachytherapy followed by hysterectomy with pelvic lymphadenectomy for FIGO stage IB1 tumors over 2cm. Brachytherapy is also used for the boost after adjuvant pelvic external beam radiotherapy. Tridimensional dosimetry with optimization allows better treatment planning, delivering high doses to target volumes with limited irradiation to the organs at risk.

Prognosis is steadily improving. Consequently, limitation of late toxicities becomes essential. Ototoxicity is common, disabling and undervalued. We aimed to inventory primary, secondary and tertiary prevention measures to reduce ototoxicity induced by radiotherapy and chemotherapy, as well as its impact on quality of life of patients treated for head and neck cancer. External radiation therapy induced 30 to 40% of ototoxicity, including irreversible sensorineural hearing loss. Primary prevention of this risk is based on limiting the dose to the cochlea: 40Gy in case of radiotherapy alone, 10Gy during concomitant chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin. Dose gradients allowed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy help respecting these limits. Concurrent chemotherapy with high dose cisplatin (100mg\/m2) also causes hearing loss by cochlear damages. Prescription of carboplatin-5-fluorouracil combination or cetuximab should be preferred in case of high risk of ototoxicity. This risk must be precisely evaluated before treatment. Ototoxicity monitoring during treatment allows early management, and lower long-term impact. Radiosensitivity predictive tests and research of genetic factors predisposing to chemo-induced ototoxicity should enable optimization of therapeutic choices and monitoring.","665":"Radical cystectomy with extended pelvic lymph node dissection remains the standard of care for non-metastatic muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Locoregional control is a key factor in the outcome of patients since it is related to overall survival, metastasis-free survival and specific survival. Locoregional recurrence rate is directly correlated to pathological results and the quality of lymphadenectomy. In addition, while pre- or postoperative chemotherapy improved overall survival, it showed no impact on locoregional recurrence-free survival. Several recent publications have led to the development of a nomogram that predicts the risk of locoregional recurrence, in order to identify patients for which adjuvant radiotherapy could be beneficial. International cooperative groups have then come together to provide the rational for adjuvant radiotherapy, reinforced by recent technical developments limiting toxicity, and to develop prospective studies to reduce the risk of relapse. The aim of this critical literature review is to provide an overview of the elements in favor of adjuvant radiation for patients treated for muscle-invasive bladder cancer.","666":"Spermatic cord sarcoma is a rare disease, which management remains controversial due to the lack of guidelines. The standard therapeutic approach is surgical: wide soft-tissue resection with radical inguinal orchidectomy, The diagnosis is made during the analysis of the specimen. The high rate of local recurrence indicates adjuvant radiotherapy of the tumor bed. The aim of this series is to determine the efficacy and safety of postoperative intensity-modulated radiotherapy for spermatic cord sarcomas. Our series included five consecutive cases of spermatic cord sarcoma treated between 2011 and 2014. The indications for radiotherapy were: R1 status after initial surgery, R1 status after wide en bloc resection and orchiectomy, high French federation of cancer centers (FNCLCC) grade, tumor size over 5cm, tumor resection during surgery. Median age at diagnosis was 66years (range 46-84years). Median follow-up was 18months (range 6-28months). Four patients had repeat surgery after incomplete removal. All surgeries were orchidectomy with primary ligation of testicular vessels. One patient did not have an in sano margin after the second surgical procedure. The median tumor size was 60mm (range 30-150mm). No recurrence was observed during the follow-up. No grade 4 toxicities were reported and the most frequent acute toxicity was dermatitis. No recurrence was reported after adjuvant intensity-modulated radiotherapy. The treatment is feasible and well tolerated and seems to provide encouraging results regarding locoregional control of the disease. Dynamic or rotational intensity-modulated radiotherapy is now recommended to decrease acute toxicities while improving the efficacy of this approach.

Our study aimed to determine retrospectively the main epidemiological, clinical, biological, and therapeutic features, as well as the prognosis of this rare form of breast carcinoma. The authors report 32 cases of mucinous carcinoma of the breast diagnosed in Mohammed-VI centre for cancer treatment in Casablanca. The average tumour size was 4.5cm (0.5-7cm). We found ten positive lymph node dissections, seven of them were of mixed mucinous carcinoma with a tumour size ranging between 4 and 7cm. Mucinous carcinoma was pure in 16 cases, mixed in 14 and a neuroendocrine differentiation was found in two cases. Most tumours were of an intermediate histological grade (n=19) with positive hormonal receptors (68%).

We identified 11 retrospective studies, on 106 patients, treated between 2007 and 2016. Treatment of rectal squamous cell carcinoma should be similar to anal carcinoma, based on exclusive chemoradiation, displaying a 5-year overall survival rate over 80%, while it was 32% in surgical series. Baseline explorations should be similar as for anal carcinoma, with an interest in PET-CT at diagnosis and monitoring, after a delay over 6 weeks after chemoradiation. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy is legitimate, to a prophylactic dose between 36 and 45Gy, and over 54Gy to the tumour. Concomitant chemotherapy should combine an antimetabolite (5-fluorouracil or capecitabine) and mitomycin C, or cisplatin. This treatment seems well tolerated, associated with grade 2 or above toxicity below 30%. Follow-up should be established on anal squamous cell carcinoma schedule, with endoscopic ultrasonography and PET-CT.

Patients survival curves were constructed using the Kaplan-Meier method, and a multivariate analysis was performed to identify independent prognostic factors. Most of the adverse events were mild during the period of combined chemoradiotherapy. Twenty-two patients experienced resection of primary tumour and 16 patients underwent radical surgery of all lesions. Only five patients had pelvic progression during the follow-up period. The median progression-free survival and median overall survival were 13 and 30 months, respectively. Radical surgery of all lesions following chemoradiotherapy was found to be an independent prognostic factor according to multivariate analysis.

","680":"The concentration of the dose delivered by protons at the end of their path, the Bragg peak, has the potential to improve external radiotherapy treatments. Unfortunately, the main strength of the protons, their finite range, is also their greatest weakness. Any uncertainty on the range may lead to inadequate target coverage or excessive toxicity. The uncertainties have multiple origins and include, among others, ballistic errors, morphological modifications or inaccurate estimations of the physical quantities necessary to predict the proton range. Uncertainties have been part of daily practice in conventional radiotherapy with X-rays for a long time. However, dose distributions delivered with X-rays are much less sensitive to uncertainties than the ones delivered with protons. This relative insensitivity enabled the management of uncertainties through safety margins using a simple formalism. The conditions of validity of this formalism are much more restrictive for proton therapy, leading to the need of developing new tools and adapted strategies to manage accurately these uncertainties. The objective of this paper is to present a vision for the management of uncertainties in proton therapy in the continuity of formalisms established for X-rays.

It allows an excellent local tumour control with 6% of local recurrence. Over the last years, partial breast radiotherapy has been developed to reduce treatment volume and duration. Intraoperative radiotherapy is one of the techniques. It offers an excellent delineation of the tumour bed and high normal tissue sparing. This purpose of this review is to describe the different intraoperative radiotherapy techniques available, to assess their potential clinical efficiency and tolerance, the recommendations for new practice with a selected population of patients and for future research.

This delegation is however partial. Indeed, the validation of the position by the therapist can be clearly performed when the registration is based on bony landmark or fiducial. The radiation oncologist needs however to make the validation in case of large target displacement, in more complex soft tissue-based registration, and in case of stereotactic body radiation therapy. Moreover, this delegation implies at least three conditions which are first the training of the staff, then the formalization of the procedures, responsibilities and delegations and finally, the evaluation of the practices of IGRT.

This strategy allows local control improvement with the risk of increased toxicity. There is therefore a growing interest to identify those patients who will benefit from radiotherapy and those who will have the same local control with surgery alone. Furthermore, the development of toxicity has been correlated with the extension of the irradiated volume and the volume receiving high doses. Technological development as intensity modulated radiotherapy and image-guided radiotherapy allows limited irradiated volume improving the protection of the organs at risk leading to clinical benefit improvement. Moreover, efforts are being done to improve local control for the patients at high risk of local relapse. In this paper, we discuss all these mentioned aspects.

Brachytherapy can be realized instead of external beam radiotherapy in selected cases, or more often used as a boost dose on a limited volume on the area at major risk of relapse, especially if a microscopic positive resection is expected. Close interaction and communication between radiation oncologists and surgeons are mandatory at the time of implantation to limit the risk of side effects. Long-term results are available for low-dose rate brachytherapy. Nowadays, pulsed dose rate or high-dose-rate brachytherapy are more often used. Brachytherapy for paediatric sarcomas is rare, and has to be managed in reference centres.

They concerned setup errors and internal organ mobility of the different volumes of patients treated by conformational radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (anal canal, meso-rectum, common, intern and extern, inguinal and pre-sacral lymph nodes). CTV to PTV margins admitted in the guidelines and atlas of consensus groups (SFRO, RTOG, AGITG) are from 0.7 to 1cm in all directions, based on expert's opinions but not on scientific data. There are no specific studies on the canal anal mobility. Most of the data are from other pelvis cancers (gynecologic, rectum and prostate). Setup errors can be reduced by daily imaging.

A reduction of the dose delivered to the muscles of the floor of the mouth and the cervical esophagus would be beneficial as well.

The surgeon in charge with soft-tissue sarcoma has to be familiar with these tumours in order to deliver an adequate treatment. Most important is the initial diagnostic procedure, comprising imaging with MRI, a core needle biopsy, and in France, referral to a centre of expertise within the clinical network NETSARC. Prior to surgery, a multidisciplinary conference determines its moment and the extent of surgical resection within the frame of a multidisciplinary approach, and also plans reconstructive surgery, when needed. A standardized operative report summarizes items necessary to describe the resection quality (i.e. tumour seen, tumour infiltrated?). In multidisciplinary staff meetings, they are compared to margins measured by the pathologist on the operative specimen. Hence, resection quality is determined collegially and defined by resection type R (R0, R1, R2) as a qualitative result. The quality of resection directly determines the 5-year risk of local recurrence, estimated between 10 and 20% in specialized centres, with the objective to attain 10%. Early rehabilitation favours better functional outcome.

In oesophageal cancer, external radiotherapy combined with concomitant chemotherapy is accepted as part of the therapeutic armamentarium in a curative intent in the preoperative setting for resectable tumours; or without surgery in inoperable patients or non-resectable tumours due to wide local and\/or regional extension. Data from the literature show conflicting results with no clinical evidence in favour of either a unique dose protocol or consensual target volume definition in the setting of exclusive chemoradiation. In the preoperative setting, chemoradiotherapy has become the standard in oesophageal cancer, even though there is no evidence that surgery may be beneficial in locally advanced tumours that respond to radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The main cause of failure after exclusive chemoradiotherapy in oesophageal cancer is locoregional relapse suggesting that doses and volumes usually considered may be inadequate. In gastric cancer, radiotherapy may be indicated postoperatively in patients with resected tumours that include less than D2 lymph node dissection or in the absence of perioperative chemotherapy. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy in gastric cancers is still under investigation. The evolving techniques of external radiotherapy, such as image-guided radiotherapy (IMRT) and volumetric modulated arctherapy (VMAT) have reduced the volume of lung and heart exposed to radiation, which seems to have diminished radiotherapy-related morbi-mortality rates.

A population-based cohort study was performed on 92 patients with head-and-neck cancer treated with radiation from 2007 until 2014 at the Portuguese Institute of Oncology of Coimbra (IPOCFG). Correlation analysis and multivariate binary logistic regression analysis were conducted in order to explore the predictive power of the considered predictors. Performance of the models is expressed as the area under the curve (AUC) of the receiver operating characteristics (ROC) curve. A nomogram to predict treatment failure was developed. Significant prognostic factors for treatment failure, after multivariate regression, were older age, non-concomitant radiation therapy and larger primary tumour volume. A regression model with these predictors revealed an AUC of .78 for an independent data set.

However, patterns of relapse after this kind of salvage treatment have never been studied. The purpose of this unicentric retrospective analysis was to assess and understand the patterns of relapse of high grade glioma treated with stereotactic radiation, with or without bevacizumab. Twenty patients with high grade glioma relapse received a stereotactic radiation; among them two patients received temozolomide and eight patients received bevacizumab; among the latter, four received also irinotecan. We matched the stereotactic radiation treatment planning scan with the images of the first treatment and of the second relapse in order to determine the patterns of failure and associate dosimetric profile. For the total population, median follow-up from the first diagnosis and relapse were 46.1 and 17.6 months, respectively. Among the 13 patients who relapsed, ten did not receive chemotherapy and three received it (P&lt;0.05), two received temozolomide and one bevacizumab. Patients who received bevacizumab had no \"out-of-field\" recurrences. Among the 32 irradiated relapses, 15 were \"in-field\" recurrences; among them two were treated with bevacizumab and 13 were not (P&lt;0.05). For the 32 lesions, a favourable prognostic factor of control was the association of a high-dose of irradiation and the use of bevacizumab. For patients with relapsed high grade glioma, local control was higher with combined bevacizumab and high-dose stereotactic radiation.

The cohort included low-risk patients and a selection of \"favourable-intermediate\" risk patients. All patients were homogeneously treated using an intraoperative dynamic planning prostate brachytherapy technique, with loose 125 iodine seeds. Hormone therapy, consisting most often of an anti-androgen alone, was given in 393 patients (58%). The 10-year overall survival was 92% (95% confidence interval [CI]: 90-94) without a significant difference between the low and the select intermediate-risk groups (P=0.17). The 10-year relapse-free survival rate for the entire cohort was 82% (95% CI: 79-85), and was significantly higher in the low-risk group than in the intermediate one (87 vs 71%; P&lt;0.0001). Twenty-six percent of the relapses observed in this series occurred after more than 10 years of follow-up. The 10-year cumulative incidence of grade 3-4 urinary toxicity (whatever the delay and the recovery) was 5.78%. The cumulative incidence of grades 3-4 rectal toxicity in the present series was 1.65% at 10 years. As for sexual toxicity, 61% of our patients retained an erectile capacity at 10 years (with or without oral medication), with age being a major factor. With a median follow-up of more than 11 years, this series appears to confirm the excellent long-term results of low-dose rate prostate brachytherapy, both in terms of survival and in terms of toxicity.

A systematic review was done by searching studies on the website http:\/\/www.pubmed.gov (Medline) using the following keywords: radiotherapy, radiation therapy, non-Hodgkin lymphoma. The management of non-Hodgkin lymphoma varies a lot according to the histological type and stage. The dose of radiotherapy has been studied in only one randomized trial, which concluded that there was no difference between the low dose and the high dose arms. Radiotherapy is a very good option in follicular, cutaneous, digestive or orbital non-Hodgkin lymphoma. A recent post hoc analysis of randomized trials on radiotherapy for high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma strongly suggested a benefit of additional radiotherapy after chemotherapy in some situations. Radiotherapy of low-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma is a very good option, while its use on high-grade non-Hodgkin lymphoma is sometimes recommended but further randomized trials are ongoing to better understand its role.

Radiotherapy was delivered using fractions of 2.5Gy on the planning target volume b and of 1.9Gy on the planning target volume a. Volumes were defined as follow: gross tumour volume b: tumour taking up contrast on T1 weighted MRI images; clinical target volume b: gross tumour volume b+0.5cm (adapted to the anatomical structures) and lastly planning target volume b: clinical target volume b+0.5cm; gross tumour volume a: tumour (gross tumour volume b)+2cm and including oedema outlined on T2Flair MRI sequences; clinical target volume a gross tumour volume a+0.5cm (adapted to the anatomical structures); planning target volume a: clinical target volume a+0.5cm.

It affects the quality of life of patients and families. It may initiate the functional and vital prognosis because of the judgment of cancer treatment. Several treatment options are available, but there is no clear consensus therapeutic especially for the pediatric population. We have identified, through a comprehensive literature search indexed publications on this subject in order to review the pharmacological and non-pharmacological approaches that have been used to prevent and treat oral mucositis. Thus, current recommendations for the management of oral mucositis are very limited, and therefore the standard of care for this complication was palliative. In recent years several studies have revealed that the use of low-energy laser was particularly interesting in the prevention and treatment of radiation-induced or chemically induced mucositis. It significantly reduces the pain, the severity and duration of the ulcer by promoting wound healing. Randomized controlled trials with a large number of patients are expected to establish preventive and therapeutic protocols. Treatment with low power laser, known devoid of side effects, is a very promising oncology care to support radio-induced mucositis and chemotherapy.

The purpose of this study was to examine how radiation oncologists report their conflicts of interests with pharmaceutical or technology industries. We collected the data of conflicts of interests disclosures in the abstract books from the annual 2012 and 2013 meetings of the American Society for Radiation Oncology (ASTRO) in Miami (FL, USA), and in Atlanta (GA, USA), respectively. Geographic origins of abstracts as well other factors were examined. We identified a total of 4219 abstracts published in the past two years. The total number of involved authors was of 28,283. All of the published abstracts had conflicts of interests disclosures. Amongst them, 563 abstracts (13.4%) reported at least one potential conflict of interests, in which 1264 (4.5%) declared a potential conflict of interests in their disclosures.

Abstracts with conflict of interest originated from North America in 75.6% of cases. USA distribution was 70.6% and 29.4% for Eastern and Western, respectively. The proportion of physicians declaring financial conflicts of interests remains extremely low, whichever geographic area authors are from. In comparison to the rest of the world, the US proved itself better at declaring potential links.

Such an important question is differentially answered in radioprotection, radiotherapy, radiology or epidemiology. A better understanding of the molecular response to radiation makes possible today a novel approach to identify the parameters that condition the fractionation effect. Particularly, the time between doses appears to be a key factor since it will permit, or not, the repair of certain radiation-induced DNA damages whose repair rates are of the order of seconds, minutes or hours: the fractionation effect will therefore vary according to the functionality of the different repair pathways, whatever for tumor or normal tissues.

The aim of our study was to evaluate the application of this 3D-printed bolus in a clinical setting. The patient was a 45-year-old man with recurrent Kimura's disease involving the auricle, receiving radiotherapy in our oncology department. A customized bolus, 5mm in thickness, was fabricated based on reconstruction of computed tomography (CT) images. The bolus was printed on a Dimension 1200 series SST 3D printer. Repeat CT-based simulation indicated an acceptable fit of the 3D-printed bolus to the target region, with a maximum air gap of less than 5mm at the tragus. Most of the surface area of the target region was covered by the 95% isodose line. The plan with the 3D-printed bolus improved target coverage compared to that without a bolus. And the plan with the 3D-printed bolus yielded comparable results to those with the paraffin wax bolus.

Between 1974 and 2012, 52 children with an average age of 6 years and a half (11 months-17 years and a half) were treated with surgery then with radiotherapy at the Comprehensive Cancer Centre of Strasbourg (France). For 44 children, the treatment consisted of a chemotherapy. After a mean follow-up of 106.6 months (7-446 months), 13 relapses and 24 deaths were observed. Overall survival at 5 years and 10 years were 62% and 57%, respectively. Disease-free survival at 5 years and 10 years were 80% and 63%, respectively. Univariate analysis found the following adverse prognostic factors: the existence of a postoperative residue, the positivity of the cerebrospinal fluid, the metastatic status and medulloblastoma of high-risk. Positivity of the cerebrospinal fluid remains a negative factor in multivariate analysis. These results confirm the survival rate obtained by a conventional approach (surgery then irradiation).

In this study, we evaluate the potential reduction of dose to normal tissue with helical tomotherapy and proton therapy for Hodgkin's lymphoma involved-field or involved-site irradiation compared to standard 3D conformal radiation therapy. Fourteen female patients with supradiaphragmatic Hodgkin's lymphoma were treated at our institution with 3D conformal radiation therapy or helical tomotherapy to a dose of 30Gy in 15 fractions. A planning comparison was achieved including proton therapy with anterior\/posterior passive scattered beams weighted 20Gy\/10Gy. Mean doses to breasts, lung tissue and heart with proton therapy were significantly lower compared to helical tomotherapy and to 3D conformal radiation therapy. Helical tomotherapy assured the best protection of lungs from doses above 15Gy with the V20Gy equal to 16.4%, compared to 19.7% for proton therapy (P=0.01) or 22.4% with 3D conformal radiation therapy (P&lt;0.01). Volumes of lung receiving doses below 15Gy were significantly larger for helical tomotherapy than for proton therapy or 3D conformal radiation therapy, with respective lung doses V10Gy=37.2%, 24.6% and 27.4%. Also, in the domain of low doses, the volumes of breast that received more than 10Gy or more than 4Gy with helical tomotherapy were double the corresponding volumes for proton therapy, with V4Gy representing more than a third of one breast volume with helical tomotherapy. Helical tomotherapy achieved a better protection to the lungs for doses above 15Gy than passive proton therapy or 3D conformal radiation therapy. However, dose distributions could generally be improved by using protons even with our current passive-beam technology, especially allowing less low dose spreading and better breast tissue sparing, which is an important factor to consider when treating Hodgkin's lymphomas in female patients. Prospective clinical study is needed to evaluate the tolerance and confirm these findings. ","807":"Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia is a common disease affecting the hematopoietic organs. The disease remains classically indolent for years preceding a blast crisis. However, the disease can affect all parts of the body. We report here an unusual localization. A 72-year-old man was followed for 2 years for an indolent chronic lymphocytic leukaemia while he presented a rapidly progressive dysuria. Prostate biopsies were performed concluding to a prostate involvement by the chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. In the absence of progression according to RAI staging system and Binet's classification, he was treated with local low-dose radiotherapy, twice 2 Gy, allowing for a rapid resolution of the symptoms. No systemic treatment was introduced, and 1 year after the completion of his treatment, he is still under watchful waiting strategy for his chronic lymphocytic leukaemia. Low-dose radiotherapy is an underused effective strategy in indolent lymphoma. In this case, urinary symptoms from a prostate involvement were relieved non-invasively at low cost.

We performed a retrospective chart review of all patients aged less than 40 years old and treated at Gustave-Roussy Cancer Centre for a squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity between 1999 and 2011. Patients and tumour characteristics, type of treatment and follow-up data were collected. Survival data were analysed according to the methods of Kaplan-Meier and both univariate and multivariate analyses were performed to look for prognostic factors regarding overall survival and progression-free survival. Sixty-three patients were identified. Median follow-up was 64 months. Most of the tumours were initially located in the mobile tongue (n=54, 85.7%). Overall 17 patients had died, including 15 from the treated cancer. Overall and progression-free survival rates at 5 years were respectively 79.6% and 68.6%. The corresponding 5 years local, regional and metastatic relapse free survival rates were 80%, 91% and 89% respectively. In the multivariate analysis only the absence of initial surgery (hazard ratio [HR]: 13.5 [2.0; 90.5]; P=0.007) was prognostic for overall survival, while alcohol abuse (HR: 0.37 [0.15; 0.9]; P=0.03) and the absence of surgery (HR: 13.6 [2.5; 74.2]; P=0.002) were associated with a decreased progression-free survival. A younger age (less than 30 year old) was not associated with the risk of recurrence or death. Survival rates and tumour control probabilities are relatively high among young patients suffering from squamous cell carcinomas of the oral cavity treated at a tertiary centre. The early identification of patients at risk of relapse is currently difficult. The balance between recurrence and treatment toxicity warrants further studies, both on the clinical level and for the development of prognostic biomarkers.

However, as these trials were conducted before the era of dose escalation the role of androgen deprivation therapy in this case is less clear.

Their prognosis is poor and surgery remains the mainstay of therapy and should be the first line of treatment. Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are second line treatment and their effectiveness remains to demonstrate. The diagnosis is clinical, radiological, histological and immunohistochemical. Malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours have a potential of local tumour recurrence very high and can metastasize. They often occur in extremity of the members but also rarely into brain. We report two cases of intracerebral nerve sheath tumour. The first was a 68-year-old woman who was admitted with progressive symptoms of headache and diplopia. A left frontotemporal malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours was diagnosed and was treated by surgery and irradiation. Ten months later, she presented a local recurrence and spine bone's metastases were treated by vertebroplasty and irradiation. The patient died 15 months after the diagnosis. The second case was a 47-year-old woman who was referred because headache and vomiting symptoms. A right frontal malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumours was diagnosed and treated by surgery and irradiation. After that, the patient had three local recurrence operated and pulmonary and cranial bone's metastases. She was still alive after 20 months.

The incidence probably increased because of therapeutic advances in oncology. Treatment is based on external beam radiotherapy, systemic treatment, intrathecal chemotherapy and supportive care. The aim of this work was to review data on external radiation therapy and carcinomatous meningitis. There are few evidences on the subject, but it is a major topic of interest. A whole brain radiation therapy is indicated in case of brain metastases or clinical encephalitis. Focal radiation therapy is recommended on symptomatic, bulky or obstructive sites. The dose depends on performance status (20 to 40 Gy in five to 20 fractions), volume to treat and available techniques (classic fractionation or hypofractionation via stereotactic radiosurgery). The objective of radiation therapy is to improve quality of life. Association with systemic therapy improves overall survival. Administration of sequential intrathecal chemotherapy may also improve overall survival, but induces more toxicity. The use of new radiotherapy techniques and development of radiosensitizing molecules in patients with good performance status could improve survival in this frequent complication of cancer.","814":"Preclinical external beam radiotherapy irradiations used to be delivered with a static broad beam. To promote the transfer from animal to man, the preclinical treatment techniques dedicated to the animal have been optimized to be similar to those delivered to patients in clinical practice. In this context, preclinical irradiators have been developed. Due to the small sizes of the animals, and the irradiation beams, the scaling to the small animal dimensions involves specific problems. Reducing the size and energy of the irradiation beams require very high technical performance, especially for the mechanical stability of the irradiator and the spatial resolution of the imaging system. In addition, the determination of the reference absorbed dose rate must be conducted with a specific methodology and suitable detectors. To date, three systems are used for preclinical studies in France. The aim of this article is to present these new irradiators dedicated to small animals from a physicist point of view, including the commissioning and the quality control.

This review article presents contemporary data on the rationale for high dose rate brachytherapy including treatment technique and future directions. ","816":"The purpose of this study was to compare free-breathing radiotherapy, end-expiration gating and end-inspiration gating for left breast cancer, with respect to the target volume coverage and dose to organs at risk. Sixteen patients underwent 3D and 4D simulation CT. For each patient, five dosimetric plans were compared: free breathing, end-inspiration gating, end-expiration gating, and two optimised plans with a 3mm reduction of the posterior field edge to create optimised end-inspiration and end-expiration plans. Dose-volume parameters, including planning target volume coverage and dose to lung, heart and left anterior descending coronary artery were analysed. Planning target volume coverage was adequate and similar in the five dosimetric plans (P=0.49). Significant advantage was found for end-inspiration gating in sparing the ipsilateral lung, heart and left anterior descending coronary artery compared to free-breathing 3D radiotherapy. Optimised end-inspiration was even more favourable than end-inspiration gating (P&lt;0.05), with less dose delivered to the ipsilateral lung, heart and left anterior descending coronary artery. When compared to end-expiration gating, end-inspiration gating dosimetric outcomes were similar regarding lung and left anterior descending coronary artery doses, but the heart dose was inferior on the end-inspiration gating compared to end-expiration gating. Breathing-adapted radiation therapy allowed for dose reduction to organs at risk (left lung, heart and left anterior descending coronary artery), while keeping the same planning target volume coverage.

Between January 2004 and January 2014, seven patients received a treatment for a neuroendocrine carcinoma of the bladder, at the department of oncology, Habib-Bourguiba Hospital, in Sfax, Tunisia. The median age was 58 years. All patients were male. Neuroendocrine carcinoma was pure in four cases and associated with urothelial carcinoma in the other three cases. Two patients were diagnosed at a metastatic stage. A cystectomy was performed in two cases. One patient received a chemotherapy and radiotherapy. The other four patients received chemotherapy alone. A single case of complete remission was observed. Median survival was 15 months (5-30 months). One patient is still alive 30 months after diagnosis.

Patients were treated with curative intent and have received chemoradiotherapy alone or followed by surgery. Different prognostic parameters were correlated to survival: cancer-related factors, patient-related factors and parameters derived from PET-CT (maximum standardized uptake value [SUV max], metabolically active tumor volume either measured with an automatic segmentation software [\"fuzzy locally adaptive bayesian\": MATVFLAB] or with an adaptive threshold method [MATVseuil] and total lesion glycolysis [TLGFLAB and TLGseuil]). The median follow-up was 21.8 months (range: 0.16-104). The median overall survival was 22 months (95% confidence interval [95%CI]: 15.2-28.9). There were 67 deaths: 49 associated with cancer and 18 from intercurrent causes. None of the tested factors was significant on overall survival. In univariate analysis, the following three factors affected the specific survival: MATVFLAB (P=0.025), TLGFLAB (P=0.04) and TLGseuil (P=0.04). In multivariate analysis, only MATVFLAB had a significant impact on specific survival (P=0.049): MATVFLAB&lt;18 cm(3): 31.2 months (95%CI: 21.7-not reached) and MATVFLAB&gt;18 cm(3): 20 months (95%CI: 11.1-228.9).

The files of 63 patients with radiographic evidence of bulky or necrotic nodal metastases treated by up-front neck dissection and definitive radiotherapy between 2000 and 2012 at two institutions were retrospectively reviewed. The primary site was oropharyngeal, hypopharyngeal or laryngeal in 63%, 21% and 13% cases, respectively. Overall, 83% of the tumours were staged pN2b or more. Extracapsular spread was found in 48 cases (77%). After a 48-month median follow-up, the 3-year locoregional control and overall survival were 88% and 68%, respectively. Only one isolated failure occurred in the dissected neck. This combination therapy provides a good locoregional tumour control.

We presently report a case of a radiation-induced undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcoma of the left gluteus maximus muscle, which developed 25 years after an initial diagnosis of aggressive fibromatosis and 21 years after a tumour recurrence. This case study illustrates the risk of developing a sarcoma in a radiation field and the need for long-term follow-up after radiation therapy. Unnecessary radiation therapy, in particular in the case of benign conditions in young patients, should be avoided.","822":"Small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the upper urinary tract is extremely rare. To our knowledge, only 25 cases have been reported in the literature. The current study reports the case of an 80-year-old patient who suffered from macroscopic haematuria. A first screening by thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT scan showed a mass located in the patient's left ureter and a left nephro-ureterectomy was consequently performed. The pathological examination of the resected specimen allowed the diagnosis of a small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the left ureter. After four months of follow-up, a PET-CT detected an isolated local recurrence on the left common iliac lymphadenopathy. After seven cycles of chemotherapy (carboplatin-etoposide), we observed a partial response followed by a new progression. It was then decided to perform an image-guided radiotherapy at a dose of 46.8 Gy, at 1.8 Gy per fraction, during 37 days to the left common iliac lymphadenopathy. After 16 months of follow-up, a complete metabolic remission was achieved. Indeed, this observation, followed by a short literature review, demonstrates the interest of radiotherapy for the treatment of a rare cancer: the small cell neuroendocrine carcinoma of the upper urinary tract.","823":null,"824":null,"825":"To evaluate the surgical possibility following concomitant chemoradiotherapy for inflammatory breast cancer, after unsucessful neoadjuvant chemotherapy.

All patients had an invasive carcinoma. All patients received a neoadjuvant chemotherapy, including anthracyclin, six patients received taxan and one received trastuzumab. Radiotherapy was delivered to the breast and regional lymph nodes in all patients at a dose of 50Gy; a boost of 20Gy was delivered to one patient. Concomitant chemotherapy was based on weekly cisplatin for six patients, on cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil the first and last weeks of radiotherapy for four patients. The median follow-up for all patients was 44 months. Mastectomy was performed in nine patients. Two- and 5-year overall survival rates were respectively 70 % and 60 %. Median local recurrence delay was 5 months; six patients died (all from cancer), seven developped metastasis. Grade 1 and 2 epithelite was respectively observed in six and two patients, grade 2 renal toxicity in three patients, grade 2 neutropenia in one patient. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy for inflammatory breast cancer after unsucessful neoadjuvant chemotherapy may control the disease in some patients and lead to mastectomy. These results have to be confirmed through a multicentric study with more patients. ","826":null,"827":"To describe the therapeutic results, with the aim to contribute to improving the care of patients with medulloblastoma. A retrospective study of 69 cases of medulloblastoma collected in the university hospital Ibn Rochd of Casablanca between 2000 and 2012. Fifty-three children with an average age of 9 years and 16 adults with an average age of 32.4 years were included in the study. Thirty-seven children and eight adults suffered from a high-risk tumour. The radiotherapy was received by all patients with a mean dose of 36 Gy to the whole brain and 54 Gy in the posterior fossa. All patients in the paediatric group and 10 patients in the adult group received concomitant chemotherapy, 44 children and four adults received adjuvant chemotherapy. Tumour recurrence was observed in 17 children after a mean follow-up period of 38 months. These recurrences were observed in five adults after a mean follow-up period of 42 months. The posterior fossa was the main site of relapses. Overall survival was 77.7% for the children and 61% for the adults. Overall survival was better (70% versus 25%) when the interval between radiotherapy and surgery was less than 40 days in the paediatric group. The recurrence rate was significantly higher for the high-risk group: 41% versus 13% for the standard risk. In the adult group, overall survival differences according to the risk group were significant (100% for the standard risk versus 37.5% for the high risk). The overall survival and recurrences rate obtained are encouraging. The risk group and time between surgery and radiotherapy were prognostic factors with significant impact on survival depending on the age group. We recommend reducing these times to improve therapeutic results. ","828":"In this article, we report the case of a newborn who presented a life-threatening hepatomegaly with respiratory distress at 12 days of life, complicating a metastatic neuroblastoma. Low-dose liver radiotherapy was performed in emergency in order to decompress. Chemotherapy has also been delivered due to a tumoral relapse 1 month after radiotherapy. After a follow-up of 20 years, this young woman is still in complete remission, with no long-term sequelae.","829":"We report the case of a patient presenting with MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) lymphoma of the prostate, who received an irradiation delivering 30.6 Gy in 17 fractions after transurethral resection. With a follow-up of 6 years, he remained alive and free of disease. In view of the literature and this case report, definitive local irradiation should be administered in this rare disease.","830":null,"831":"Brain tumours are the most frequent solid tumours in children and the most frequent radiotherapy indications in paediatrics, with frequent late effects: cognitive, osseous, visual, auditory and hormonal. A better protection of healthy tissues by improved beam ballistics, with particle therapy, is expected to decrease significantly late effects without decreasing local control and survival. This article reviews the scientific literature to advocate indications of protontherapy and carbon ion therapy for childhood central nervous system cancer, and estimate the expected therapeutic benefits. A systematic review was performed on paediatric brain tumour treatments using Medline (from 1966 to March of 2014). To be included, clinical trials had to meet the following criteria: age of patients 18 years or younger, treated with radiation, and report of survival. Studies were also selected according to the evidence level. A secondary search of cited references found other studies about cognitive functions, quality of life, the comparison of photon and proton dosimetry showing potential dose escalation and\/or sparing of organs at risk with protontherapy; and studies on dosimetric and technical issues related to protontherapy. A total of 7051 primary references published were retrieved, among which 40 clinical studies and 60 papers about quality of life, dose distribution and dosimetry were analysed, as well as the ongoing clinical trials. These papers have been summarized and reported in a specific document made available to the participants of a final 1-day workshop. Tumours of the meningeal envelop and bony cranial structures were excluded from the analysis. Protontherapy allows outstanding ballistics to target the tumour area, while substantially decreasing radiation dose to the normal tissues. There are many indications of protontherapy for paediatric brain tumours in curative intent, either for localized treatment of ependymomas, germ-cell tumours, craniopharyngiomas, low-grade gliomas; or panventricular irradiation of pure non-secreting germinoma; or craniospinal irradiation of medulloblastomas and metastatic pure germinomas. Carbon ion therapy is just emerging and may be studied for highly aggressive and radioresistant tumours, as an initial treatment for diffuse brainstem gliomas, and for relapse of high-grade gliomas. Both protontherapy and carbon ion therapy are promising for paediatric brain tumours. The benefit of decreasing late effects without altering survival has been described for most paediatric brain tumours with protontherapy and is currently assessed in ongoing clinical trials with up-to-date proton devices. Unfortunately, in 2015, only a minority of paediatric patients in France can receive protontherapy due to the lack of equipment. ","832":"Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) has proven its dosimetric superiority over conformational radiotherapy for cervix cancers in terms of digestive toxicity. Volumetric modulated arctherapy (VMAT) has shown its dosimetric interest when compared to IMRT with static beams. The purpose of our study was to compare conformational radiotherapy, VMAT and tomotherapy for cervical cancers with para-aortic lymph nodes irradiation. The dosimetric data from ten patients were compared between the three techniques, with collection of the dose received by the planning target volume, kidneys, bowel, rectum, bladder, bone marrow and spinal cord, as well as the complete dose. There was a significant difference in favour of VMAT and tomotherapy when compared with conformational radiotherapy for the organs at risk: intestines (V(20 Gy), V(30 Gy) and V(45 Gy)), rectum (V(30 Gy) and V(45 Gy)), bladder (V(30 Gy) and V(45 Gy)) and kidneys (V(12 Gy), Daverage, V(20 Gy)). Volumes receiving 20, 30 and 45 Gy were significantly higher in conformational radiotherapy than in VMAT and tomotherapy. There was a significant difference in favour of tomotherapy when compared with VMAT for V(12 Gy) in kidneys and V(45 Gy) in the bladder. This study confirms the interest of VMAT and tomotherapy for pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes irradiation of cervix cancer when compared with conformational radiotherapy. There was little difference between VMAT and tomotherapy, except for kidney sparing, which was better with tomotherapy and thus may be interesting for patients receiving nephrotoxic chemotherapy. ","833":"Malignant tumours of the eye are not common, barely representing 1 % of all cancers. This article aims to summarise, for each of the main eye malignant diseases, aspects of epidemiology, diagnostic methods and treatments, with a focus on radiation therapy techniques. The studied tumours are: eye metastasis, intraocular and ocular adnexal lymphomas, uveal melanomas, malignant tumours of the conjunctive, of the lids, and retinoblastomas. The last chapter outlines ocular complications of radiation therapy and their management.","834":"Concomitant chemoradiation followed by brachytherapy is the standard treatment for locally advanced cervical cancers. The place of adjuvant hysterectomy remains unclear but tends to be limited to incomplete responses to radiotherapy or local relapse. The aim was to analyse the benefit from immediate salvage surgery following radiation therapy in incomplete responders. Among the patients with locally advanced cervical cancer treated with concomitant chemoradiation followed by 3D image-guided adaptive brachytherapy and hysterectomy, cases with genuine macroscopic remnant, defined as at least 1cm in width, were identified. Their clinical data and outcomes were retrospectively reviewed and compared to the patients treated with the same modalities. Fifty-eight patients were included, with a median follow-up of 4.2 years. After hysterectomy, 9 patients had macroscopic residual disease, 10 microscopic and the remaining 39 patients were considered in complete histological response. The 4-year overall survival and disease-free survival rates were significantly decreased in patients with macroscopic residual disease: 50 and 51% versus 92% and 93%, respectively. Intestinal grades 3-4 toxicities were reported in 10.4% and urinary grades 3-4 in 8.6% in the whole population without distinctive histological features. Planning aims were reached in only one patient with macroscopic residuum (11.1%). In univariate analysis, overall treatment time (&gt;55 days) and histological subtype (adenocarcinomas or adenosquamous carcinomas) appeared to be significant predictive factors for macroscopic remnant after treatment completion (P=0.021 and P=0.017, respectively). In multivariate analysis, treatment time was the only independent factor (P=0.046, odds ratio=7.0). Although immediate salvage hysterectomy in incomplete responders provided a 4-year disease-free survival of 51%, its impact on late morbidity is significant. Efforts should focus on respect of treatment time and dose escalation. Adenocarcinoma might require higher high-risk clinical target volume planning aims. ","835":"To assess the overall treatment time of radiotherapy delivered with curative intent in a cohort of 185 consecutive patients and the causes of this possible delay. If delay, to propose corrective actions. We report a single-center prospective study including all consecutive patients receiving a radiation therapy with curative intent, from 1st December 2013 to 28th February 2014, on the three linear accelerators of the radiotherapy department. For each fraction missed, the causes of non-completion were prospectively collected. This analysis took into account the following parameters: age, sex, occupation, transport type and duration, tumour localization, radiation dose, concomitant chemotherapy, hospitalization, type of linear accelerator. One hundred and fifty-five patients were included in the study (183 evaluable, two did not complete treatment). The overall treatment time was respected for 31 patients (17%). It was lengthened on 4.6 days (d) (0-29 d; median: 3d). The mean number of delayed fractions was 3.4 (0-17; median: 2). The reasons of delay were: breakdown 32.2%; maintenance 29.3%; holiday 11%; treatment toxicity 9.4%; inadequate planning 8.6%; other disease 3.9%; treatment refusal 2.1%; unspecified personal reasons 1.5%; refusal to wait 0.8%; transportation 0.3%; error of communication 0.3%; other 0.6%. Two parameters had a significant impact on the overall treatment time: the type of linear accelerator in relation to breakdown occurrence (P&lt;0.001) and transportation duration (more or less than 40 min, P=0.022). One hundred and thirty-eight patients (75%) and 79 patients (43%) were treated on one or more than two Saturdays. Treatment on Saturday significantly reduced the overall treatment time (median, 1.9 d; P&lt;0.001). The overall treatment time was globally respected excluding break down and maintenance. Their impact on the overall treatment time is minimized by the systematic opening of the department on Saturdays. ","836":"Stereotactic body radiation therapy is the standard treatment for inoperable patients with early-stage lung cancer. Local control rates range from 80 to 90 % 2 years after treatment. The role of positron emission tomography in patient selection is well known, but its use for target definition or therapeutic response evaluation is less clear. We reviewed the literature in order to assess the current state of knowledge in this area.","837":"Risk analysis is typically considered from two complementary points of view: predictive analysis performed prior, and retrospective analysis, which follows the internal reporting of adverse situations or malfunctions, both on the organizational and material or human aspects. The purpose of these additional analyzes is to ensure that planned or implemented measures allow to keep risks to a level deemed tolerable or acceptable at a given time and in a given situation. Where a risk is deemed unacceptable, risk reduction measures should be considered (prevention, limiting the consequences and protection). ","838":"Stereotactic body radiation therapy for lung cancer is now well established for patients who are not eligible to surgery. These patients can benefit from a curative treatment, which is a new therapeutic indication. Protocols are effective and well tolerated even for the most fragile patients. Three randomized trials comparing stereotactic body radiation therapy and surgery failed due to poor accrual. However, taking into account the favourable available data, the choice of stereotactic body radiation therapy in first intention arises. The treatment decision has to be discussed in a multidisciplinary way, while considering the opinion of the patient, who must be clearly informed about the principle of both therapeutic options. ","839":"The development of both image-guided and intensity-modulated radiotherapy has underlined the question of treatment adaptation to anatomical and\/or biological changes occurring during radiotherapy course and modifying delivered dose to the patient. Adaptive radiotherapy has been introduced when several plans are used to treat a patient during radiotherapy. Adaptation may be performed online, offline or in a hybrid way. New images of the patient are needed for adaptive radiotherapy to perform many processes: image registration, segmentation and evaluation of cumulative dose. Deformable image registration methods are generally used to image registration and contours propagation. Fraction and cumulative dose evaluations use deformable image registration methods or more complex methods based on Monte-Carlo calculation. These methods have uncertainties and have to be evaluated. However, evaluation and validation tools are still being developed. The physicist's mission is to ensure that every new technology, such as adaptive radiotherapy, is deployed with highest safety, by technical validation and by implementing a specific quality assurance program. Adaptive radiotherapy implementation still raises many questions, so its potential clinical application requires great caution and should be carefully explored in prospective clinical trials. ","840":"Functional imaging with positron emission tomography (PET) is interesting to optimize radiotherapy planning, and probably to perform dose redistribution in many cancers. However, in 2015, fluorodeoxyglucose (FDG)-PET is validated only for therapy planning for lung cancer. The interest of dose painting, PET in non-lung cancers, the interest of other tracers (even PET hypoxia tracers), DW-MRI, and PET-MR for radiotherapy needs to be demonstrated in prospective multicentric phase III studies on large series of patients.","841":"Cancers in childhood are rare, representing 1% of all the cancers in developing countries. On the whole, the overall survival approaches 75% at 5 years. The radiation dose decrease in lots of indications as well as better optimized planning treatments lead to decrease the long-term toxicities in some indications. However, the radiation toxicity remains frequent, often specific of pediatric situations. Long-term toxicities are mainly neurologic, sensitive, endocrine, or linked to growth impairment (bones or muscular). Radio-induced second-cancers are also frequent after a long follow-up after cancer in childhood but will not be discussed here. Doses to critical organs as well as the most frequent radio-induced late-effects will be discussed in this paper.","842":"Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) aims to take into account the anatomical variations occurring during the course of radiotherapy, by direct or indirect visualization of the target volume followed by a corrective action. The movements of the target, or at least the set-up errors are corrected by moving the treatment table, corresponding to the simplest and most validated IGRT modality in a standard practice. The deformations of the target volume and organs at risk are however much more common, and unfortunately much more complicated to consider, requiring multiple planning before or during the treatment, corresponding to the adaptive radiotherapy strategies. The planning target volume must be carefully chosen according to these anatomic variations. This article reviews the modalities of IGRT, standard or under evaluation, according to the different tumour sites. ","843":"Palliative radiation therapy is well-known in the setting of metastatic lesions (haemostatic, analgesic, anti-inflammatory aims, etc.). Palliative primary tumour radiotherapy is less studied. Here we propose a review of palliative indications of primary tumours, the most studied in the literature, and their radiotherapy modalities (target volumes and fractionation). ","844":"Lobectomy with lymphadenectomy is the standard of care of patients with early stage non-small cell lung cancer, and the use of minimally invasive approaches is associated with reduced morbidity when compared with thoracotomy. Segmentectomy with lymphadenectomy seems to provide a curative effect equivalent to that of lobectomy for stage IA tumours of 2 cm or smaller, and for pure or predominant ground glass opacities. The combination of lung-sparing resections with minimally invasive approaches results in preserved pulmonary function, improved quality of life and very low morbidity. This benefit persists in so-called high-risk patients. Among patients with clinical stage IA managed with sublobar resections, more than 25% are proved to have a more advanced pathologic stage at surgery, suggesting that alternative ablative therapies would result in an incomplete resection in a similar proportion. Moreover, resection samples tumour tissue that is adequate in quantity and quality, and provides material for \"research biopsies\" to consolidate tissue availability for clinical trials, translational research, and in biobanks.","845":"The ultimate goal in radiation oncology is to offer a personalized treatment to all patients indicated for radiotherapy. Radiomics is a tool that reinforces a deep analysis of tumors at the molecular aspect taking into account intrinsic susceptibility in a long-term follow-up. Radiomics allow qualitative and quantitative performance analyses with high throughput extraction of numeric radiologic data to obtain predictive or prognostic information from patients treated for cancer. A second approach is to define biological or constitutional that could change the practice. This technique included normal tissue individual susceptibility but also potential response of tumors under ionizing radiation treatment. These \"omics\" are biological and technical techniques leading to simultaneous novel identification and exploration a set of genes, lipids, proteins. ","846":"Cancer is a disease that predominantly occurs in older patients who represent a quarter of the population in western countries. Numerous types of cancer are observed in elderly people. Radiotherapy is one of the most powerful treatments against cancer. Most of published studies have demonstrated feasibility of radiotherapy in curative or palliative intent whatever cancer types are considered. Complete geriatric assessment and a multidisciplinary approach are the key points. The purpose of this review is to highlight sights of radiation oncology specifically related to aging. Particular emphasis is placed on logistic and technical aspects of radiation, as dose, irradiated volume, fractionation and the potential usefulness of new technologies. ","847":"Half of all cancers occur in patients older than 70 years. National cancer plans in France promote the emergence of geriatric oncology, whose aim is that every elder cancer patient receives a pertinent treatment, according to his frailty. Geriatric intervention has been evaluated in various conditions or patients since 30 years. Meta-analysis has shown the benefits on autonomy and mortality. But benefits are related to the organization of geriatric care, especially when integrated care is provided. Literature on geriatric oncology is relatively poor. But it is certain that a geriatric comprehensive assessment provided a lot of important information for the care of cancer patients, leading to a modification of cancer treatment in many cases. Randomized trials will soon begin to evaluate the benefits of geriatric integrated care for elder cancer patients, in terms of mortality and quality of life. Actually, in oncogeriatic coordination units, pilot organizations are developed for the satisfaction of patients and professionals. ","848":"The purpose of this work was to implement a simple dosimetric alert tool in a retrospective study for six patients suffering from head and neck cancer to detect when a patient might require an adaptive radiotherapy. The dosimetric tool generates a 3D cartography of two dosimetric complementary information: a dose variation tolerance map and a dose differential map. The tolerance map is calculated on the initial scanner (CTinit) using the planned dose distribution. It shows for each voxel of each delineated volume the availability for local dose variations during the course of radiotherapy without exceeding the dose threshold. The differential dose map is generated on the tomographic image CBCT (CBCTtreatment). It shows dose variations between the planned and the actual delivered dose distribution for each voxel. By comparing both maps, when a voxel presents a value superior to the corresponding dose variation tolerance, an alert is generated and the anatomical areas concerned are visually indicated to the physician. The application of the dosimetric tool on six patients with head and neck cancers reveals the ability of the tool to detect cases requiring a new treatment plan. Two patients whose the tumour shrinkage produced an increase of the delivered dose to the spinal cord beyond 45 Gy have been detected. The development of the dosimetric tool allows the automatic detection, with no delineation needs, of patients suffering from head and neck cancers requiring an adaptive strategy. ","849":null,"850":"In case of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for locally advanced cervix carcinoma, the objectives were to quantify the difference between the planned and the delivered doses by a standard irradiation, and to estimate the dosimetric benefit of a pretreatment planning library-based adaptive radiotherapy. Ten patients with locally advanced cervix carcinoma had three planning CTs corresponding to three bladder volumes: empty, intermediate (vi) and full. On each CT, two IMRT plans were generated to deliver 45 Gy to the planning target volume (PTV), with two different margins: clinical target volume (CTV)+10mm and CTV+15 mm. Using bi-weekly CBCTs, three scenarios of treatment have been simulated and compared: standard IMRT (one vi planning) with 10 and 15 mm margins and adaptive radiotherapy with 10mm margin. The cumulated dose in the organs at risk was estimated by elastic registration. In case of standard IMRT, the cumulated dose was significantly different than the planning dose, with an under-dose of the CTV and the bladder, and an over-dose of the rectum and the peritoneal cavity. For 54% of the fractions, the adaptive radiotherapy planning was not based on vi. Considering the cumulated dose and compared to IMRT with 10-mm margin, adaptive radiotherapy increased the dose to the CTV (1.4 Gy for D98%) and decreased slightly the dose to the rectum and the peritoneal cavity. Compared to a standard IMRT with 15 mm margin, adaptive radiotherapy decreased significantly the dose to the rectum (20% for V40), the bladder (13% for V40) and the peritoneal cavity (2% for V35). A pretreatment planning library-based adaptive radiotherapy in cervix carcinoma decreases the dose to the organs at risk and increases the dose to the CTV. ","851":"Mucositis remains a frequent complication of radiotherapy. Low level laser applications are used to accelerate the healing process. This technique is used routinely in our centre. It is performed by delegation by radiotherapists. The conditions of this delegation of tasks are addressed here. ","852":"No consensual guidelines exist regarding the management of early effects of radiotherapy. But preventive and curative care strategies could be adapted in the aim to delay erythema, limit complications and improve patients' comfort. Prevention involves encouraging patients to take care of their skin, avoid moisture, frictions, sun exposition and dry soap. When these rules seem insufficient, products (dressings, solution, or cream) could be prescribed, according to the individual risk of each patient. Preventive measures are accentuated when radiodermatitis appears and\/or topics indicated for wound healing could be applied. Care (education, dressing, observation) needs a multidisciplinary approach. Improvements of radiotherapy treatments (methods, techniques) have been the most effective evolution on radiodermatitis. ","853":"A working group within the French association of radiotherapy quality managers (AFQSR) proposed to implement an inter-institution audit among radiotherapy quality managers to share best practices, experience, and to have an external measurement of the effectiveness of the quality control processes implemented. A checklist was devised based on the French nuclear safety authority guide N(o) 5 and a procedure was formalized. The audit focuses on the effectiveness of the quality management process in radiotherapy. This article details the rationale for the project and conduct of the audit.","854":"Since twenty years, many nanoparticles based on high atomic number elements have been developed as radiosensitizers. The design of these nanoparticles is limited by the classical rules associated with the development of nanoparticles for oncology and by the specific ones associated to radiosensitizers, which aim to increase the effect of the dose in the tumor area and to spare the health tissues. For this application, systemic administration of nanodrugs is possible. This paper will discuss the development of AGuIX nanoparticles and will emphasize on this example the critical points for the development of a nanodrug for this application. AGuIX nanoparticles display hydrodynamic diameters of a few nanometers and are composed of polysiloxane and gadolinium chelates. This particle has been used in many preclinical studies and is evaluated for a further phase I clinical trial. Finally, in addition to its high radiosensitizing potential, AGuIX display MRI functionality and can be used as theranostic nanodrug for personalized medicine.","855":"Image-guided radiation therapy consists in acquiring in-room images to improve patient and mainly tumour set up accuracy. Many devices based on ionising or non-ionising radiations were designed in recent years. The use of such devices is of major importance in the management of patient radiotherapy courses. Those imaging sessions require to clearly define procedures in each radiotherapy department (image modality, acquisition frequency, corrective action, staff training and tasks). A quick review of the different existing image-guided radiation therapy devices is presented. In addition, the results of a French national survey about image-guided radiation therapy are presented: the survey is about both equipment and procedures. A total of 57 radiotherapy departments have participated, representing more than 160 treatment devices. About three linear accelerators out of four are equipped with an image-guiding device. The most common equipment is the CBCT system. Most centres have set up training sessions for the technicians to allow them to analyse online daily images. The management of in-room imaging dose is still under investigation, but many centres use an accounting scheme. While the devices are used to adjust the positioning of patients, in more than half of the centres, the practice had an impact on the choice of clinical and planning target volume margins. This survey led to an inventory in 2015, and could be renewed in some years. ","856":"To describe the evaluation of our risk mapping methodology over the past two years. Based on the FMEA (failure mode effects analysis) method, some aspects have been adapted, e.g. the concept of risk control and effort scale, some others have been introduced, e.g. the concept of residual risk management. A weekly meeting is scheduled by a multidisciplinary team in order to support the different projects. Experiments and practice have led us to upgrade our scales of gravity and detectability, identify critical points and introduce the residual risk management concept. Some difficulties with regards to the multiplicity of scenarios still prevail. Risk mapping is an essential tool in the implementation of risk quality management, specifically when the methodology is progressive and takes into consideration all the members of a pluridisciplinary team. ","857":"Stereotactic body radiation therapy is a modern approach for delivering ablative high doses of irradiation in small volumes. This technique is being developed for the treatment of liver tumors, such as hepatocellular carcinoma, cholangiocarcinoma, or liver metastases. It represents a real alternative to surgical resection or liver transplantation when patients are inoperable or when tumours are unresectable. It is mandatory to standardize and simplify the current methods of evaluation and monitoring in order to benefit from a better understanding of the effectiveness and of the tolerance of this new treatment modality. Several scientific societies have recently proposed recommendations for the implementation of stereotactic radiotherapy for liver tumors. We conducted a literature review to provide recommendations for follow-up after completion of a stereotactic body radiation therapy for liver tumours. ","858":"Anal canal carcinomas remain rare, but their management has improved recently. The PET-CT is now used as a standard at the first diagnosis and after relapses. The introduction of intensity-modulated irradiation techniques makes it possible to better conform the pelviperineal and inguinal volumes, improving the homogeneity of the irradiation while sparing some pelvic structures, thus reducing acute and late effects. Nevertheless, the conversion from 3D to intensity-modulated radiotherapy needs a specific and careful approach, mainly for the management of the perineal region, where relapses and complications occur. Last but not least, new chemotherapy associations are studied for metastatic disease. ","859":"Anatomical changes and tumor regression during thoracic radiotherapy may alter the treatment volumes. These modifications are not taken into account into set-up or motion margins used for treatment planning. Their dosimetric impact could be significant and a better understanding of the changes occurring during the 6 to 7 weeks of treatment could be useful in order to define quantitative thresholds before a new treatment planning is needed. Margins could also be reduced in order to better spare organs at risk and perform targeted dose escalation. This review assesses the potential of morphologic and metabolic imaging during treatment for adaptive radiotherapy in non-small cell lung cancer.","860":"Adaptive radiotherapy is defined as all processes leading to the modification of a treatment plan on the basis of patient-specific variations observed during the course of a treatment. This concept is currently of particular relevance due to the development of onboard volumetric imaging systems, which allow for daily viewing of variations in both tumour and organs at risk in terms of position, shape or volume. However, its application in routine clinical practice is limited due to the demanding nature of the processes involved (re-delineation and replanning) and increased dependence on available human resources. Even if \"online\" strategies, based on deformable image registration (DIR) algorithms, could lead to a reduction in both work and calculation time, for the moment their use is limited to the research field due to uncertainties surrounding the validity of results gathered. Other strategies without DIR can be used as \"offline\" or \"hybrid offline-online\" strategies that seem to offer a compromise between time consumption and therapeutic gain for the patient. ","861":"Hepatocellular carcinoma is the major complication of chronic liver diseases and particularly of cirrhosis whatever its etiology. Once encountered mainly in the endemic countries of hepatitis B and C, the incidence of hepatocellular carcinoma (6\/100,000) is parallel to the global development of diabetes, overweight and alcohol consumption. Little progress has been made for this cancer, whose mortality is 100 % at 10 years. Liver transplantation is the only truly curative treatment (survival more than 50 % at 10 years) since it allows the eradication of hepatocellular carcinoma and its essential cause, cirrhotic liver. This is the only possible therapy when liver function is impaired. It has little impact since in the richest countries, less than 10 % of cases can be transplanted. Surgical resection and percutaneous destruction methods (uni- and multipolar radiofrequency, microwave, cryotherapy, electroporation) are the preferred treatments (survival less than 50 % at 5 years) but are only applicable for moderate tumour masses and in the absence of adjuvant therapy, are effective only in the medium term. Most patients received chemoembolization through hepatic artery, whose action is modest. Radiotherapy is widely used in Asia but almost non-existent in Western countries in this indication. Sorafenib is the only effective drug but its impact is modest. Therapies combining two modalities (embolization and radiotherapy; embolization and radiofrequency) seem promising and deserve wider testing. Screening and monitoring of cirrhosis is probably the major measure for potentially curative therapies.","862":"Hadron therapy (including protons and ions) is still expanding worldwide, although still limited by the cost and thus the number of available facilities. If the historical indications remain eye melanomas, skull base tumours and paediatric tumours for protontherapy; and salivary glands, paranasal sinus and nasal cavity tumours, and soft tissue sarcomas for carbon ions, no conclusion can be drawn about the role of these modalities for other tumours, such as prostate, lung cancers. Since 2013, more than 100 clinical trials are on-going, including comparisons between advanced photons modalities, protontherapy and carbon ions therapy. An important technological and scientific (physics, radiobiology) effort has been made in parallel in order to reduce the cost of the facilities and to fully take advantages of the beam properties: standardization of beam scanning, image guided treatment, robust and 4D planning. Furthermore, the increasing number of facilities, the development of hypofractionation and the selection of indications will contribute to find the true place of particle therapy, despite the \"screening effect\" of the cost. The long term effects assessment on large patient cohorts will allow or not to correlate adverse effects and dosimetric data, always evoked.","863":"Nowadays, bronchopulmonary stereotactic body radiotherapy is recommended as the standard of care in treating medically inoperable patients with curative intent according to guidelines of multiple organizations. Changes in lung density on computed tomography are common after stereotactic body radiotherapy and can confound the early detection of recurrence. Radiation-induced computed tomography lung changes after bronchopulmonary stereotactic body radiotherapy differ from those observed after conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. It is mandatory to standardize and simplify our clinical, radiological and functional evaluation criteria to better distinguish tumor progression and radiation-induced pneumonitis. We performed a literature review to describe post-stereotactic body radiotherapy findings on computed tomography and positron emission tomography, identify imaging characteristics that predict recurrence and propose a follow-up algorithm. ","864":"Anal canal carcinoma is a rare and curable disease for which the standard of care is radiation therapy with concurrent 5-fluoro-uracil and mitomycine-based chemotherapy. Post-treatment follow-up however is rather poorly defined. This article offers a review of the various post-treatment surveillance options both for early diagnosis of relapse and care for late treatment effects. While follow-up remains mostly clinical, we will discuss morphologic (endorectal echoendoscopy, pelvic magnetic resonance imaging, tomodensitometry and positron emission tomography) and biologic (squamous cell carcinoma antigen and pathology) follow-up so as to determine their diagnostic and prognostic value.","865":"First-line palliative radiotherapy for painful bone metastases is an effective treatment whatever its fractionation (single or multiple fractions). It is also indicated after failure or insufficient effect of a first irradiation, or the appearance of new painful site. Other indications are spinal cord compression, either as an adjuvant to surgery or as sole treatment, and after surgery for long bone metastases. The development of high precision techniques (stereotactic conditions) widens the possibility of re-irradiation when tolerance doses to normal tissues have already been delivered. Local control and possibly overall survival could be improved in oligometastatic patients.","866":"The French nuclear safety authority is responsible for the control of radiation protection in radiotherapy since 2002. Controls are based on the public health and the labour codes and on the procedures defined by the controlled health care facility for its quality and safety management system according to ASN decision No. 2008-DC-0103. Inspectors verify the adequacy of the quality and safety management procedures and their implementation, and select process steps on the basis of feedback from events notified to ASN. Topics of the inspection are communicated to the facility at the launch of a campaign, which enables them to anticipate the inspectors' expectations. In cases where they are not physicians, inspectors are not allowed to access information covered by medical confidentiality. The consulted documents must therefore be expunged of any patient-identifying information. Exchanges before the inspection are intended to facilitate the provision of documents that may be consulted. Finally, exchange slots between inspectors and the local professionals must be organized. Based on improvements achieved by the health care centres and on recommendations from a joint working group of radiotherapy professionals and the nuclear safety authority, changes will be made in the control procedure that will be implemented when developing the inspection program for 2016-2019.","867":"Radiotherapy and chemotherapy are standard treatment of head and neck cancer alone or associated to surgical treatment. Early (during treatment or the following weeks) and late side effects contribute to malnutrition in this population at risk. In this context, nutritional support adapted by dietary monitoring and enteral nutrition (nasogastric tube or gastrostomy) are often necessary. The early identification of the patients with high malnutrition risk and requiring enteral nutrition is necessary to improve the tolerance and efficacy of treatment. ","868":"Systematic clinical radiotherapy audits have been introduced in Belgium in 2011, as part of the Federal Cancer Plan. This is in compliance with article 11 of the 97\/43 Council directive of Euratom states, translated into the Belgian legislation by royal decree in 2002. The principle of clinical audits has thus been part of the federal legal requirements for more than 10 years. However, its application had to wait for the development of a practical approach: what authority will audit, who will be the auditors, along which methodology, at what frequency, etc. Since 2002, the Federal College of Radiotherapy has the mission to monitor quality of radiotherapy at large. It was therefore decided after discussions with the relevant administration at the Ministry of Health and the Federal Agency for Nuclear Control that the College would practically organise the audits. Early in the 2000s, the IAEA developed a manual for comprehensive audits, as a tool for quality improvement. Auditors were professionals of the domain and the audit visit took the form of a peer review. Great care was taken to assemble an audit party able to cover all aspects of clinical radiotherapy with a radiation oncologist, a medical physicist, a radiation therapist and, on demand, a quality officer. The IAEA manual contains a series of questionnaires to be prepared by the audited centre in advance (pre-audit and self-assessment), indicating what specific areas the auditors would assess. It is also a template for the auditors, ensuring that no area is left aside or forgotten during the site visit. The report, at the end of the visit, is drafted according to a specific report template, also developed by IAEA. Several members of the Belgian radiotherapy community have developed their auditor's skills by participating to the IAEA audit program; they are the core of the auditor Belgian team. ","869":"Management of cancer in the elderly needs more attention than in younger patients mainly because of comorbidities and geriatric syndromes. Each frailty encountered will facilitate adverse events and complications which are more frequent and more severe in the elderly and have to be anticipated to control for the risk of organ failure and dependencies. Fortunately, tools which have been developed and validated by geriatricians, are available to the oncologists and their validity has been demonstrated in oncology. Yet, they are quite time-consuming and consequently available for a minority of patients. Furthermore, it appears that some of the older patients can be proposed standard therapy and do not need the intervention of geriatricians. This is the reason why screening tools have been developed and validated among which the G8 questionnaire appears to be one of the best. This approach is beginning to be implemented in the daily routine in France and abroad but their appropriate use according to cancer types and treatment intensity should be further improved for the benefit of our patients. ","870":"Hypofractionated radiotherapy is now more widely prescribed due to improved targeting techniques (intensity modulated radiotherapy, image-guided radiotherapy and stereotactic radiotherapy). Low dose hypofractionated radiotherapy is routinely administered mostly for palliative purposes. High or very high dose hypofractionated irradiation must be delivered according to very strict procedures since every minor deviation can lead to major changes in dose delivery to the tumor volume and organs at risk. Thus, each stage of the processing must be carefully monitored starting from the limitations and the choice of the hypofractionation technique, tumour contouring and dose constraints prescription, planning and finally dose calculation and patient positioning verification.","871":"The immunosuppressive effects of radiation therapy have long been the only ones considered. It has been demonstrated that exposure to ionizing radiation induces the release of tumour antigens which activates both the innate immune system and the adaptive immune response of the host. The purpose of tumour immunotherapy is based on the principle that reversal of tolerance to immunogenic tumours would be able to activate an immune response against tumour cells. Preclinical data and clinical studies early phase suggest a potential therapeutic benefit of immunotherapy combined with radiation therapy. The objective of this article is to review how tumour cells interact with the immune system and how ionizing radiation modulate this interaction and finally the combination of perspectives of immunotherapy and ionizing radiation by focusing on existing clinical data. ","872":"Radiation therapy plays a central role in treatment strategies of cervical cancer. Follow-up after external pelvic radiation therapy and brachytherapy is based upon French and international specific recommendations. It aims to assess early tumour response, and to detect local or metastatic recurrences which can be suitable for salvage treatment. Follow-up after radiation therapy for cervical cancer should also assess gastro-intestinal, urinary and sexual toxicities which may have an impact on quality of life. This is a major concern in the evaluation of the results of intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) and MRI-guided brachytherapy, which should lead to a better local control and to a better bowel tolerance. ","873":"The delineation of organs at risk is a part of the planning of irradiation treatments. With the delineation of the target volumes, this task is essential and is followed by the appropriate calculations of a dose distribution from radiation beams and the validation of the treatment plan. The contouring of organs at risk could influence the dosimetric parameters, treatment planning and also the outcome of the patient. The treatment intent (curative or palliative), doses and fractionations and also the type of organs at risk have an impact on the delineation. Optimized radiation techniques and reirradiations make delineation and definition of doses constraints more difficult. The second edition of the guidelines established by the French society of radiation oncologists (SFRO) includes a chapter dedicated to the delineation of organs at risk and dose constraints. The transposition of these recommendations in current practice remains the responsibility of the radiation oncologist who implements them and who has to judge their relevance. ","874":"Modifications of radiotherapy indications or schedules because of age could be discussed in view of a different evolution of the disease or because of specific toxicities. One important aim is to decrease the number of hospital transports. For breast cancer, the rate of local relapse after lumpectomy is lower in old patients; moreover, characteristics of the disease are often more favourable (hormonosensitivity, low grade). However, adjuvant irradiation decreases significantly the incidence of breast relapse and must be systematically proposed. Hypofractionnated schedules must be recommended; limited data are available for accelerated partial breast irradiation in old women and these techniques must not be used in routine. For low or intermediate risk prostate cancer, assessment of comorbidities is crucial before considering any invasive treatment. A life expectancy of at least 10 years is required if a curative approach, potentially toxic is proposed. In this case, radiotherapy is often the good choice, giving less sequelae than surgery. The indication of androgen deprivation must take into account cardiovascular and bone history. Management of gynaecological cancers must follow the same recommendations as in young women. Exclusive postoperative brachytherapy must be recommended in early stage endometrial carcinomas. Brachytherapy must be also systematically integrated in the radiotherapy program for cervix cancers, even in old women.","875":"In August 2013, the French nuclear safety agency (ASN) requested the permanent group of experts in radiation protection in medicine (GPMED) to propose recommendations on the implementation of new technology and techniques in radiation oncology. These recommendations were finalized in February 2015 by the GPMED. In April 2015, the ASN sent a letter to the French ministry of health (DGS\/DGOS), and its national health agencies (ANSM, INCa, HAS). In these letters, ASN proposed that, from the 12 recommendations made by the GPMED, an action plan should be established, whose control could be assigned to the French national cancer institute (INCa), as a pilot of the national committee for radiotherapy and that this proposal has to be considered at the next meeting of the national committee of radiotherapy.","876":"For rectal cancers, the current standard of care consists of chemoradiation followed by radical surgery with total mesorectal excision. Oncologic results are good, especially regarding local recurrence rates, but at the cost of high morbidity rates and poor anorectal, urinary and sexual function results. Since chemoradiation yields 15 to 25% pathological complete response, the role of radical surgery is questioned for patients presenting with good response after chemoradiation and two organ preservation strategies have been offered: watch and wait strategy and local excision strategy. The aim of this review is to give the results of organ preservation after chemoradiotherapy series and to highlight different questions regarding initial patient's selection, complete clinical response definition, risk of mesorectal nodal involvement, follow-up modalities as well as oncologic and functional results. ","877":"Prostate cancer is the most frequent cancer among European males with a high survival rate. The economic impact of treatments and follow-up are significant. The objectives of the follow-up after prostate radiotherapy is multiple: diagnosis and treatment of side-effects, early detection of biochemical recurrence, with the aim of proposing a second local treatment to improve quality of life or overall survival and feedback of the treatment results to better inform patients at the beginning of the disease. This article reports incidence of main side-effects (digestive, urinary and sexual) with their treatments and guidelines for clinical and biological follow-up with strategies of imaging studies and salvage treatments. ","878":"In 2002, at the McGill University Health Centre, we began a program of hypofractionated radiotherapy for patients with low risk prostate cancer as an alternative to conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. Our initial hypofractionation regimen was 66 Gy given in 22 fractions, prescribed to the isocenter, delivered with 3D-conformal radiotherapy plan. The clinical target volume was the prostate gland and the planning target volume consisted of the clinical target volume plus a 7-mm margin in all directions. Hormonal therapy was not given to any patient. The long-term results for this group of patients confirmed the feasibility, good tolerance and excellent disease control of the regimen with the extra-benefit of being convenient to both patients and the health system by shortening treatment duration. The outcomes of this approach stimulated us to use hypofractionation in patients with intermediate-risk. Analysis of 100 intermediate-risk patients receiving our hypofractionated radiotherapy regimen (no hormones) shows, at median follow-up of 75 months, 8-year biochemical recurrence free and cancer specific survival rates of 90% and 95%, respectively, with acceptable toxicity. Our technique changed from 3D to intensity modulated radiotherapy with the dose adjusted to 60 Gy in 20 fractions. Lastly, we have expanded the program to high-risk patients where IMRT treatments are given to the pelvic nodes (44 Gy in 20 fractions) with a simultaneous integrated boost delivery to the prostate (60 Gy in the same 20 fractions). Our long-term results have shown that moderate hypofractionated radiotherapy for prostate cancer is safe and provides good tumor control comparable to high-dose conventionally fractionated radiotherapy. This hypofractionated regimen has been routinely used in our institution. ","879":"The benefits of adjuvant radiotherapy following lumpectomy for early-stage breast cancer are well established. The most widely used method consists of roughly twenty-five fractions of whole-breast irradiation. In recent years, there has been a growing trend towards hypofractionated external beam radiotherapy regimens. Many of these techniques have been shown to be equivalent in terms of tumor control and cosmetic results while minimizing inconvenience and costs both to the patient and health care system. Here, we present the various hypofractionation modalities, patient selection criteria, consensus guideline recommendations and a look at future indications.","880":"Linked to the difference of prognosis, the terms and conditions of the follow-up of low-grade and high-grade gliomas treated by irradiation differ highly. Patients treated for a low-grade glioma have prolonged survival. In this case, monitoring of toxicities linked to the treatment is a major objective. Opportunistic infections and depression are corticosteroids side effects widely underestimated. Radionecrosis search and differentiation with recurrent disease are done by MRI. Perfusion and spectroscopy showing a choline\/creatine ratio increase are in favour of disease recurrence. Cognitive status and quality of life must be evaluated during the follow-up. They have to be evaluated by adapted scales. Cognitive rehabilitation improves interestingly the post-treatment cognitive status. Pseudoprogression rates for high-grade gliomas are near 20%. MRI is the benchmark imaging for its diagnosis. Diffusion weight imaging and spectroscopy are actually the most interesting techniques. ","881":"Head and neck cancer management often involves heavy multimodal treatments including radiotherapy. Despite the improvement of intensity-modulated radiation therapy, acute and late toxicities remain important. After such treatment, patients have to face different potential problems, depending on the post-therapeutic delay. In this way, short-term follow-up permits to appreciate the healing of acute toxicities and response to treatment. Long-term follow-up aims to recognize second primitive tumours and distant failure, and to detect and manage late toxicities. Medical and psychosocial supportive cares are essential, even after several years of complete remission. The objective of this article is to review the modalities of short-term and long-term follow-up of patients who receive a radiotherapy for head and neck cancer. ","882":"Mild cognitive impairment occurs frequently with ageing, concerning memory complaint, attention and executive dysfunction without any consequence on the activities of daily living. They are strongly linked to the presence of vascular risk factors in adulthood. Nevertheless with the continuous progression of life expectancy, the incidence of dementia drastically increases after sixty-five years of age and the number of old people with dementia is expected to increase by 75% in 2030 in France. Caring for elderly patients with cancer needs to face the possibility of cognitive impairment and its consequences on a good comprehension of diagnosis and treatment and ability to properly take medication. Comprehensive geriatric assessment can help to diagnose cognitive impairment and evaluate the consequences on instrumental activities of daily living (IADL) and activities of daily living (ADL). Home care may be organised with the help of the family or social workers. Physiotherapy and speech rehabilitation are often useful. Assistance for housekeeping, shopping and cooking may be financed by social organisations such as APA in France. Complex cases must be referred to case managers in homes for patients suffering for Alzheimer's disease (MAIA) who liaise between doctors and home carers with good results. ","883":"Pencil beam scanning and filter free techniques may involve dose-rates considerably higher than those used in conventional external-beam radiotherapy. Our purpose was to investigate normal tissue and tumour responses in vivo to short pulses of radiation. C57BL\/6J mice were exposed to bilateral thorax irradiation using pulsed (at least 40 Gy\/s, flash) or conventional dose-rate irradiation (0.03 Gy\/s or less) in single dose. Immunohistochemical and histological methods were used to compare early radio-induced apoptosis and the development of lung fibrosis in the two situations. The response of two human (HBCx-12A, HEp-2) tumour xenografts in nude mice and one syngeneic, orthotopic lung carcinoma in C57BL\/6J mice (TC-1 Luc+), was monitored in both radiation modes. A 17 Gy conventional irradiation induced pulmonary fibrosis and activation of the TGF-beta cascade in 100% of the animals 24-36 weeks post-treatment, as expected, whereas no animal developed complications below 23 Gy flash irradiation, and a 30 Gy flash irradiation was required to induce the same extent of fibrosis as 17 Gy conventional irradiation. Cutaneous lesions were also reduced in severity. Flash irradiation protected vascular and bronchial smooth muscle cells as well as epithelial cells of bronchi against acute apoptosis as shown by analysis of caspase-3 activation and TUNEL staining. In contrast, the antitumour effectiveness of flash irradiation was maintained and not different from that of conventional irradiation. Flash irradiation shifted by a large factor the threshold dose required to initiate lung fibrosis without loss of the antitumour efficiency, suggesting that the method might be used to advantage to minimize the complications of radiotherapy. ","884":"Study of the pattern of relapse for locally advanced oesophageal cancer and analysis of the local recurrences according to irradiated volume. We performed a monocentric retrospective study of patients treated in the integrated centre of oncology (Angers, France). Two treatment strategies were used: concurrent chemoradiation alone or followed by surgery. Recurrences were classified as: locoregional, either isolated or associated with distant metastasis, and metastatic only. Locoregional relapses were subclassified as in-field, out-field, or mixed. Between March 2004 and October 2011, 168 patients were treated: 130 by chemoradiation, and 38 by chemoradiation followed by surgery. The median supero-inferior margins added to the gross tumour volume in order to create the planning tumour volume was 5cm (range: 0.5-21). Sixty-two percent of patients (n=104) relapsed: 82 locoregional relapses (49%), including 45 isolated relapses (27%) and 37 associated with distant metastasis relapses (22%), and 22 metastatic relapses (13%). From the 82 locoregional relapses, only four isolated relapses were exclusively out-field. With 5cm supero-inferior margins added to gross tumour volume, less than 3% of patients had an isolated out-field recurrence. However, half of the patients suffered in-field local recurrence and one third had metastases. These findings advocate for a limited prophylactic nodal irradiation. Trials are ongoing to assess dose escalation or surgery in order to increase local control. ","885":"The aim of the present study was to discuss the epidemiology, clinical and pathologic features, treatment, and prognosis of primary neuroendocrine carcinomas of the breast. We report 21 cases diagnosed over a period of 12 years (1995-2011) at the university hospital of Sfax. A review of the clinical data with pathology and immunohistochemistry study was carried out for all the cases. The average age was 62 years (34-86 years). At the time of the diagnosis, tumours were classified T1 and T2 (16 cases), N1 (11 cases) and M1 in two cases. The histological examination has shown 13 cases of solid neuroendocrine carcinoma, six cases of large cell type and two cases of atypical carcinoid. Grade I and II SBR were found in 18 cases. Eighty-one percent of the tumours were reactive for synaptophysin; all tumours were positive for chromogranin. Thirteen (61.9%) tumours were estrogen receptor-positive and 12 (57.5%) progesterone receptor-positive. Nineteen (90.5%) tumours were negative for HER2\/neu. Overall five-year survival was 72.7%. All patients had surgical treatment with modified radical mastectomy in 13 cases. Adjuvant treatment was indicated according to histopronostic elements. For primary neuroendocrine carcinoma of the breast, multivariate analysis identified three predictive factors for mortality: disease stage, histological grade and lymph node involvement. ","886":"To report survival and morbidity of a large homogeneous cohort of patients with a locally advanced esophageal or cardia carcinoma and put in evidence predictive factors of locoregional control and survival. Hundred and two patients were treated at the university hospital of Tours between 1990 and 2010 and received neo-adjuvant chemoradiation therapy with external irradiation (40Gy-44Gy) and two courses of chemotherapy (5-fluoro-uracile and cisplatine). Esophagectomy associated with lymph node dissection was performed about ten weeks after the end of chemoradiation therapy. The median follow-up was 22.4 months [6-185 months]. The overall survival rates at 2 and 5years were 53% and 27%, respectively. The median overall survival was estimated at 27months. The overall 2-year survival between patients \"responders\" and patients \"non-responders\" was 67% vs 26%, respectively (P&lt;0.0001). In case of histological response, there was a benefit in terms of overall survival (P&lt;0.0001), locoregional control (P&lt;0.0036) and disease-free survival (P&lt;0.001). Overall survival at 2years was 64% for ypN0 group vs 32% for ypN1 group (P&lt;0.0001). The median survival was estimated at 37months against 15months in the absence of lymph node involvement (P&lt;0.0001). Our results in terms of survival, tolerance and morbidity and mortality were comparable to those in the literature. Complete histological response of lymph node was associated with an improvement of local control, disease-free survival and overall survival. ","887":"Paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma is a rare tumor. Multimodality treatment should involve surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy, which are indicated according to risk groups. Risk group stratification depends on pretreatment staging and definitive histology. Patients older than 10years or those with suspected lymph nodes on imaging have higher incidence of lymph node involvement. Prognosis is excellent for localized tumors, survival rates exceed 90%. We report a case of embryonal paratesticular rhabdomyosarcoma treated in our institution. ","888":"This work evaluated the interobserver variability in cone beam computed tomography (CBCT) registration for prostate cancers treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Twelve technologists realized 286 CBCT\/CT registrations (bone registration followed by prostate to prostate registration). The registration results were compared to those obtained by two radiation oncologists (reference). Each technologist reported the shifts calculated by the software in all three axes. A statistical analysis allowed us to calculate the minimum threshold under which 95% of the observers found similar values. A variance analysis followed by the post hoc test were used to find differences in interobserver registration variability and determine whether any individual users performed registrations which differed significantly from those of the other users. The registration differences compared to the reference in the three directions in terms of 95th percentile are: 2.1mm left-right, 3.5mm target-gun, 7.3mm anterior-posterior. In the posterior direction, 4% of the observers have found differences superior to 8mm, margin used in routine without the use of a daily CBCT. The variance test revealed a P-value &lt;0.05 only for target-gun and for all observers there was no significant difference compared to the reference. This study confirmed the interest of a 3D tissue registration for prostate treatments. The registration study showed a good interobserver reproducibility. This showed the importance of a daily CBCT\/CT registration in prostate treatment with the possibility of a planning target volume margin reduction in the three directions. An evaluation of a partial delegation of registration to technologists should be done by the radiation oncologists. ","889":null,"890":"Several studies showed a breast cancer downstaging due to screening. A first national survey was conducted in France in 2001-2002 to evaluate in the current clinical practice the clinicopathological features and treatments of 1049 firstly operated breast cancers. In order to assess the impact of the national screening program implemented in all regions in France in 2004, a new survey was performed in 2007-2008. The new survey included 1433 firstly operated breast cancers prospectively collected. These new data were compared to the results of the first national survey. According to TN classification, we found in the second survey T0: 27.6%, T1: 48.6%, T2: 21.3%, T3T4: 3.8% and Tx: 0.7%. Infiltrating ductal and lobular carcinomas represented 80% and 13% of tumours. Hormone receptors were positive in 85.3% and Her-2 overexpressed in 12.4% of tumours (83.9% and 20.6% in the first survey); 68.2% and 32% were pN0 and pN1-3. Lumpectomy and mastectomy were performed in 77% and 23% of the cases. Axillary dissection, sentinel node biopsy or both were performed in 42.6%, 41% and 16.4% of the cases, respectively. Radiotherapy, chemotherapy, hormonotherapy and trastuzumab were given to 93%, 51%, 83% and 9.3% of the patients. Compared with the results from the first survey, we found an increase of infraclinical lesions (T0 from 8.4 to 27.6%) and a wide decrease of pN+ rate (from 44% to 32%). The mastectomy rate was constant (23%), as well as radiotherapy use, whereas chemotherapy use decreased from 62.8 to 55.6%. A complete national screening coverage clearly provides a favourable modification of breast cancer clinicopathological features. Both locoregional and adjuvant treatments were greatly downscaled. ","891":"Medulloblastoma are cerebellar tumours belonging to the group of primitive neuroectodermal tumours (PNET) and are the most common malignant brain tumours of childhood. These tumours are rare and heterogeneous, requiring some multicentric prospective studies and multidisciplinary care. The classical therapeutic approaches are based on clinical, radiological and surgical data. They involve surgery, radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Some histological features were added to characterize risk. More recently, molecular knowledge has allowed to devise risk-adapted strategies and helped to define groups with good outcome and reduce long-term sequelae, improve the prognostic of high-risk medulloblastoma and develop new therapeutic tools.","892":"Head and neck cancers have been widely studied concerning their sensitivity to radiation therapy. Several parameters affect tumour response to radiation therapy. Some parameters are linked to the tumour. Large or invasive tumours, localization, such as oral cavity or adenopathy, are factors of radioresistance. Others parameters are linked to the patients themselves. Tobacco intoxication during radiotherapy and a low hemoglobin level contribute to radioresistance. More recently, a positive human papilloma virus (HPV) status has been reported to positively affect radiosensitivity. Finally, other parameters are related to tumour biology. Hypoxia, intrinsic radiosensitivity of tumour cells, tumour differentiation and repopulation (provided by Ki-67 index or EGFR level) are components of radiosensitivity. Currently, concurrent chemoradiotherapy is one of the gold standard treatments to overcome clinical outcome of locally advanced head and neck cancer. This combination increases locoregional control and survival. Taxane-based induction chemotherapy can also be an alternative. Another validated approach is the association of radiotherapy with cetuximab (EGFR targeting) but only one randomized study has been published. Fractionation modifications, especially hyperfractionation, have given positive results on both tumour control and survival. Strategies targeting hypoxia improve locoregional control but have less clinical impact. ","893":"Adjuvant radiotherapy, after breast conserving surgery or mastectomy for breast cancer, improves overall survival while decreasing the risk of recurrence. However, prophylactic postoperative radiotherapy of locoregional lymph nodes for breast cancer, particularly of the axillary region, is still controversial since the benefits and the risks due to axillary irradiation have not been well defined. To begin with, when performing conformal radiotherapy, volume definition is crucial for the analysis of the risk-benefit balance of any radiation treatment. Definition and contouring of the axillary lymph node region is discussed in this work, as per the recommendations of the European Society for Radiotherapy and Oncology (ESTRO). Axillary recurrences are rare, and the recent trend leads toward less aggressive surgery with regard to the axilla. In this literature review we present the data that lead us to avoid adjuvant axillary radiotherapy in pN0, pN0i+ and pN1mi patients even without axillary clearance and to perform it in some other situations. Finally, we propose an update about the potential toxicity of adjuvant axillary irradiation, which is essential for therapeutic decision-making based on current evidence, and to guide us in the evolution of our techniques and indications of axillary radiotherapy. ","894":null,"895":"In the adjuvant breast cancer treatment, postoperative radiotherapy plays a principal part with an action against the microscopic residual disease in the lymph nodes after mastectomy as well as after breast conserving surgery. This positive effect is observed also in the case of small inner lesions in patients without lymph node involvement. At the same time, there is a recognized risk of cardiac toxicity directly related to the irradiation of internal mammary nodes. This paper is a report on the current available techniques to irradiate the internal mammary nodes, including promising new technology that may help limiting the risk of cardiac toxicity. ","896":"The advent of sentinel lymph node technique has led to a shift in lymph node staging, due to the emergence of new entities, namely micrometastases and isolated tumour cells. In addition, the therapeutic role of axillary lymph node dissection is more and more questioned and radiotherapy has been shown to be equivalent to complementary axillary lymph node dissection in patients without clinical node involvement. This article looks at the literature in favour of performing axillary irradiation in patients with pN1mi stage breast cancer who have undergone a mastectomy without a complementary axillary lymph node dissection, and in favour of abstention of any further treatment of the axilla in patients with pN0(i+) or pN1mi tumours who have undergone breast conserving surgery and a sentinel lymph node procedure followed by systemic treatment. The impact of regional lymph nodes irradiation in case of axillary involvement 2mm or less is also discussed. ","897":"In patients with breast cancer, axillary lymph node micrometastasis detection has been more frequent with a better definition since the introduction of the sentinel node procedure. In this review, we focus on pN1mi micrometastasis and review the literature in order to determine factors involved in making the decision of a regional treatment. ","898":"In addition to achieve breast conserving surgery after neoadjuvant chemotherapy, its indications are growing, especially in Her2 overexpressing and triple negative breast cancers owing to the emergence of new targeted therapies. Radiotherapy belongs to breast cancer management. However, some questions are still unresolved regarding nodes area irradiation after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. This short communication reviews indications of radiotherapy of node areas in breast cancer after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. ","899":"Long-term results of randomised trials have confirmed the safety and efficacy of hypofractionated radiotherapy using approximately 2.6 Gy per fraction to lower total doses of 40-42.6 Gy delivered over 3 weeks, for postoperative treatment of early breast cancer. In these trials, hypofractionated radiotherapy was predominantly used for breast only treatment, while there are fewer trials that specifically examined hypofractionated radiotherapy to the breast plus regional nodes. Hypofractionated locoregional radiation is considered a standard of care in the United Kingdom and in some parts of Canada. We aim to review the radiobiology and normal tissue effects of hypofractionated locoregional radiation and to summarize available published clinical experiences using this treatment strategy as adjuvant therapy after breast conserving surgery or mastectomy for women with early breast cancer.","900":"In France, in 2005, there were approximately 16,000 new cases of head and neck cancer. These cancers have an unfavourable prognosis: the survival rates at 3 and 10 years are 50% and 10% respectively. The consumption of alcohol and tobacco is the most important risk factor; in some countries HPV infection was identified as a risk factor of head and neck tumours. Furthermore, a poor oral hygiene seems to raise this risk. We found many decay and periodontium problems in patients with an upper aerodigestive tract cancer. An evaluation of dental state is necessary before any cancer treatment. Treatments by radiotherapy engender noxious effects: hypocellular, hypovascularization, hypoxie of the irradiated tissues, which lead to immediate and chronically oral complications such as mucositis, fibrosis, xerostomia, decay, or osteoradionecrosis. An oral follow-up of these patients can prevent these complications, or reduce the severity of oral complications, and promote a good oral state. ","901":"Treatment volume is a major risk factor of radiation-induced toxicity. As nodal irradiation increases treatment volume, radiation toxicity should be greater. Nevertheless, scientific randomised data do not support this fact. However, a radiation-induced toxicity is possible outside tangential fields in the nodal volumes not related to breast-only treatment. Treatment should not be adapted only to the disease but personalized to the individual risk of toxicity for each patient. ","902":"Irradiation of node areas is still a complex challenge in external radiotherapy for breast cancer. Acceptable target coverage is always balanced by protection of organs at risk and patient morphology. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy increases the quality of dose distribution on the planning target volume, but modifies dramatically the irradiation coverage of critical structures in a different way compared to 3D treatment. In this paper we analyze this new technique in breast treatment with node regions, its expected gain and potential risks. ","903":"Androgen deprivation therapy is widely used in combination with radiotherapy for the treatment of prostate cancer. The knowledge of the biology of the androgen axis could help the radiation oncologist to combine both modalities in an efficient way. Moreover, new drugs have recently been approved and their role in combination with radiation needs pre-clinical and clinical studies. This review summarized the main data on the biology of androgen receptor and the potential implications for the physician. Mechanisms of interactions between androgen deprivation therapy and radiotherapy are also presented and discussed. ","904":"Women with ductal carcinoma in situ are treated with breast-conserving surgery and radiation therapy. The impact of an additive boost radiation is under evaluation. All women treated for ductal carcinoma in situ with breast-conserving surgery and whole breast radiation therapy at a total dose of 45Gy with a boost radiation from 1990 to 2008 have been included in this retrospective monocentric retrospective study. We included 171 patients. Boost radiation to the surgical bed was delivered by brachytherapy in 66 patients (39%), by direct en-face electron beam in 86 patients (50%), and by tangential fields using photon beams in 19 patients (11%). Median follow-up was 95.1months. Eight local relapses (4.6%) have occurred. The 10-year local recurrence-free survival rate was 97%. The 10-year overall survival rate was 98%. On multivariable analysis, brachytherapy (P=0.05; HR=5.15; IC=1-26.3) was associated with a reduction risk of local recurrence-free survival. In our experience, women treated for a ductal carcinoma in situ with breast-conserving surgery and whole breast radiation therapy with a boost radiation have a high 10-year local recurrence-free survival rate.

Thirty-one patients were enrolled. One free breathe and two moderate deep inspiration breath-hold images were obtained. A field-in-field-IMRT free-breathing plan and two field-in-field-IMRT moderate deep inspiration breath-holding plans were compared in the dosimetry to target volume coverage of the glandular breast tissue and organs at risks for each patient. The breath-holding time under moderate deep inspiration extended significantly after breathing training (P&lt;0.05). There was no significant difference between the free-breathing and moderate deep inspiration breath-holding in the target volume coverage. The volume of the ipsilateral lung in the free-breathing technique were significantly smaller than the moderate deep inspiration breath-holding techniques (P&lt;0.05); however, there was no significant difference between the two moderate deep inspiration breath-holding plans. There were no significant differences in target volume coverage between the three plans for the field-in-field-IMRT (all P&gt;0.05).

The aim of this study is to know whether c-myc amplification can reliably discriminate these two entities. Forty-seven patients treated for breast angiosarcomas were studied. Thirty-two patients were diagnosed with postradiation angiosarcomas after breast cancer treatment and 15 patients with primary angiosarcomas. Interphase fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH) was performed by hybridization of probes covering C-MYC (chromosome 8q24.21) and CEP8 on tissue sections. Amplification (5- to 20-fold) of the c-myc oncogene was found in all breast radiation-induced angiosarcomas (32 tumours) but in none of the 15 primary angiosarcomas except one (7%). This study reinforces that there are true pathogenetic differences between the two types of breast angiosarcomas which are morphologically indistinguishable. These data point the pathways preferentially involved in the pathogenesis of post radiation angiosarcomas of the breast and may provide the basis for an additional targeted therapy.

The major clinical breakthrough of head and neck meta-analyses are summarized, regarding concomitant chemotherapy, altered fractionated chemotherapy, new regimens of induction chemotherapy or the use of radioprotectants. Recent methodological developments are described, including network meta-analyses, the validation of surrogate markers.

A couple of weeks later, the metastatic lesion appeared on his left iris. He has received whole brain radiation therapy including the iris lesion in the radiation fields. Through this case report and a literature review, we discuss the incidence, the different clinical presentations and the impact on the survival prognosis of this uncommon metastatic site.

This paper reviews potential indications of proton beam therapy. A systematic review on Medline was performed with the following keywords proton beam therapy, cancer, heavy particle, charged particle. No phase III trial has been published using proton beam therapy in comparison with the best photon therapy, but numerous retrospective and dosimetric studies have revealed an advantage of proton beam therapy compared to photons, above all in tumours next to parallel organs at risk (thoracic and abdominal tumours). This could be accompanied with a better safety profile and\/or a better tumoural control; numerous phase 0, I, II, III and IV studies are ongoing to examine these hypotheses in more common cancers. Use of proton beam therapy is growing for common cancers within clinical trials but some indications could be applied sooner since in silico analysis showed major advantages with this technique. ","911":"Timing of radiotherapy for low-grade gliomas is still controversial due to concerns of possible adverse late effects. Prevention of possible late cognitive sequelae by hippocampal avoidance has shown promise in phase II trials. A patient with progressive low-grade glioma with gradual dedifferentiation into anaplastic astrocytoma is presented along with description of radiotherapy planning process attempting to spare the hippocampus. To our knowledge, this is the first described case using volumetric modulated arc technique to spare hippocampus during transformed low-grade glioma radiotherapy. Using modern intensity-modulated radiotherapy systems it is possible to selectively spare hippocampus together with other standard organs at risk. For selected patients, an attempt to spare hippocampus can be considered as long as other dose characteristics are not significantly compromised compared to standard treatment plan created without any effort to avoid hippocampus. ","912":null,"913":"The standard treatment of locally advanced (stage II and III) squamous cell carcinoma of the anal canal consists of concurrent chemoradiotherapy (two cycles of 5-fluoro-uracil, mitomycin C, on a 28-day cycle), with a dose of 45 Gy in 1.8 Gy per fraction in the prophylactic planning target volume and additional 14 to 20 Gy in the boost planning target volume (5 days per week) with a possibility of 15 days gap period between the two sequences. While conformal irradiation may only yield suboptimal tumor coverage using complex photon\/electron field junctions (especially on nodal areas), intensity modulated radiation therapy techniques (segmented static, dynamic, volumetric modulated arc therapy and helical tomotherapy) allow better tumour coverage while sparing organs at risk from intermediate\/high doses (small intestine, perineum\/genitalia, bladder, pelvic bone, etc.). Such dosimetric advantages result in fewer severe acute toxicities and better potential to avoid a prolonged treatment break that increases risk of local failure. These techniques also allow a reduction in late gastrointestinal and skin toxicities of grade 3 or above, as well as better functional conservation of anorectal sphincter. The technical achievements (simulation, contouring, prescription dose, treatment planning, control quality) of volumetric modulated arctherapy are discussed.","914":"Urothelial carcinomas of the upper urinary tract are rare entities. Surgery remains the mainstay of the management. The use of others therapeutic modalities is not clearly defined yet.

The management of brain metastases has changed due to a better knowledge of immunohistochemical data and molecular biological data, the development of new surgical, radiotherapeutic approaches and improvement of systemic treatments. Most of the time, the prognosis is still limited to several months, nevertheless, prolonged survival may be now observed in some sub-groups of patients. The main prognostic factors include the type and subtype of the primitive, age, general status of the patient, number and location of brain metastases, extracerebral disease. The multidisciplinary discussion should take into account all of these parameters. We should notice also that treatments including surgery or radiotherapy may be proposed in a symptomatic goal in advanced phases of the disease underlying the multidisciplinary approach until late in the evolution of the disease.

The efficacy of standard platinum-based chemotherapy is comparable inside and outside the brain, justifying its use as front-line therapy. The intracranial efficacy of targeted therapies (EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors, ALK inhibitors) is demonstrated, and is globally superior to the efficacy of standard chemotherapy, justifying their use as front-line therapy in case of EGFR activating mutation or ALK rearrangement (providing the change in the crizotinib label in France). The concomitant use of whole brain radiotherapy and a systemic treatment (chemotherapy or targeted therapy) is not recommended in the absence of a demonstrated better efficacy and\/or acceptable safety profile. Several trials are ongoing to assess new whole brain radiotherapy modalities, new targeted therapies alone or in combination, especially exploring immunotherapy.

In this article, we propose a management strategy based on the state of current knowledge and available therapeutic resources. ","923":"The therapeutic management of brain metastases depends upon their diagnosis and characteristics. It is therefore imperative that imaging provides accurate diagnosis, identification, size and localization information of intracranial lesions in patients with presumed cerebral metastatic disease. MRI exhibits superior sensitivity to CT for small lesions identification and to evaluate their precise anatomical location. The CT-scan will be made only in case of MRI's contraindication or if MRI cannot be obtained in an acceptable delay for the management of the patient. In clinical practice, the radiologic metastasis evaluation is based on visual image analyses. Thus, a particular attention is paid to the imaging protocol with the aim to optimize the diagnosis of small lesions and to evaluate their evolution. The MRI protocol must include: 1) non-contrast T1, 2) diffusion, 3) T2* or susceptibility-weighted imaging, 4) dynamic susceptibility contrast perfusion, 5) FLAIR with contrast injection, 6) T1 with contrast injection preferentially using the 3D spin echo images. The role of the nuclear medicine imaging is still limited in the diagnosis of brain metastasis. The Tc-sestamibi brain imaging or PET with amino acid tracers can differentiate local brain metastasis recurrence from radionecrosis but still to be evaluated.","924":"Brain metastases impact on the survival of the patients, but on their quality of life as well. The objective of the management of these patients is then double. Currently, due to medical advances, survivals tend to improve, especially for some tumor subtypes. During the course of the disease, different neurological signs and symptoms can be observed according to the location, the number and the volume of the metastase(s). Patients and caregivers are especially worried about the loss of autonomy and cognitive impairments. A permanent dialogue, during the course of the disease, is mandatory, in order to adapt the management to the objectives determined by the patients and the medical team. These objectives may vary according to the objective response rates of the disease to anticancer therapies, according to the impact of the disease and its management in daily living. Anticancer therapies and supportive care must be appreciated according to their impact on the survival, on the preservation of the functional independence and the quality of life of the patient, on their abilities to preserve the neurological status and delay the apparition of new neurological signs and symptoms, and their adverse events. Supportive care, cognition and quality of life should be regularly evaluated and adapted according to the objectives of the management of brain metastases patients. Different approaches are described in this paper. ","925":"Surgical excision of brain metastases has been well evaluated in unique metastases. Two randomized phase III trial have shown that combined with adjuvant whole brain radiotherapy, it significantly improves overall survival. However, even in the presence of multiple brain metastases, surgery may be useful. Also, even in lesions amenable to radiosurgery, surgical resection is preferred when tumors displayed cystic or necrotic aspect with important edema or when located in highly eloquent areas or cortico-subcortically. Furthermore, surgery may have a diagnostic role, in the absence of histological documentation of the primary disease, to rule out a differential diagnosis (brain abscess, lymphoma, primary tumor of the central nervous system or radionecrosis). Finally, the biological documentation of brain metastatic disease might be useful in situations where a specific targeted therapy can be proposed. Selection of patients who will really benefit from surgery should take into account three factors, clinical and functional status of the patient, systemic disease status and characteristics of intracranial metastases. Given the improved overall survival of cancer patients partially due to the advent of effective targeted therapies on systemic disease, a renewed interest has been given to the local treatment of brain metastases. Surgical resection currently represents a valuable tool in the armamentarium of brain metastases but has also become a diagnostic and decision tool that can affect therapeutic strategies in these patients. ","926":"Proton therapy allows a highly precise tumour volume irradiation with a low dose delivered to the healthy tissues. The steep dose gradients observed and the high treatment conformity require a precise knowledge of the proton range in matter and the target volume position relative to the beam. Thus, proton imaging allows an improvement of the treatment accuracy, and thereby, in treatment quality. Initially suggested in 1963, radiographic imaging with proton is still not used in clinical routine. The principal difficulty is the lack of spatial resolution, induced by the multiple Coulomb scattering of protons with nuclei. Moreover, its realization for all clinical locations requires relatively high energies that are previously not considered for clinical routine. Abandoned for some time in favor of X-ray technologies, research into new imaging methods using protons is back in the news because of the increase of proton radiation therapy centers in the world. This article exhibits a non-exhaustive state of the art in proton imaging. ","927":"Stereotactic radiotherapy of brain metastases is increasingly proposed after polydisciplinary debates among experts. Its definition and modalities of prescription, indications and clinical interest regarding the balance between efficacy versus toxicity need to be discussed. Stereotactic radiotherapy is a 'high precision' irradiation technique (within 1mm), using different machines (with invasive contention or frameless, photons X or gamma) delivering high doses (4 to 25Gy) in a limited number of fractions (usually 1 to 5, ten maximum) with a high dose gradient. Dose prescription will depend on materials, dose constraints to organs at risk varying with fractionation. Stereotactic radiotherapy may be proposed: (1) in combination with whole brain radiotherapy with the goal of increasing (modestly) overall survival of patients with a good performance status, 1 to 3 brain metastases and a controlled extracranial disease; (2) for recurrence of 1-3 brain metastases after whole brain radiotherapy; (3) after complete resection of a large and\/or symptomatic brain metastases; (4) after diagnosis of 3-5 asymptomatic new or progressing brain metastases during systemic therapy, with the aim of delaying whole brain radiotherapy (avoiding its potential neurotoxicity) and maintaining a high focal control rate. Only a strict follow-up with clinical and MRI every 3 months will permit to deliver iterative stereotactic radiotherapies without jeopardizing survival. Simultaneous delivering of stereotactic radiotherapy with targeted medicines should be carefully discussed.","928":"The most frequent intracranial brain tumours are brain metastases. All types of cancer can develop brain metastases but two thirds of brain metastases occurring in adult patients are secondary to one of these three cancers: lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma. In accordance with these data, this review is focusing on the epidemiology of these three types of cancer. We report here the incidence, risk factors, median time of brain metastases occurrence after diagnosis of the primary cancer, prognosis and median survival for these three types of cancer. We also discuss the clinical implications of these data. The second part of this review is focusing on the Graded Prognostic Assessment scores in all types of primary cancer with brain metastases, how they can be applied in clinical research for a better stratification of patients, and to some extent in clinical practice to guide decisions for personalized treatments. These scores provide a better understanding of the different profiles of clinical evolution that can be observed amongst patients suffering from brain metastases according to the type of primary cancer. We highlighted the most remarkable and useful clinical implications of these data. ","929":"The first step in the diagnosis of a metastatic brain lesion is to exclude a primary central nervous sytem tumour, followed by verification or identification of the primary tumor site, in order to guide the clinician to specific therapy. In addition to morphological features, ancillary immunohistochemical study is most effective for the evaluation of a metastatic neoplasm of unknown primary. Although the main principles are same, there are slight variations in the approach to the secondary lesion in the central nervous system versus other regions. Indeed, immunohistochemical approach focuses on the most common tumor types associated with secondary brain colonization: lung cancer, breast cancer and melanoma. Several studies have reported that targeted therapies are capable of reducing brain metastases in melanoma or non-small cell lung cancer, sometimes with a high dramatic response. These results have clearly impacted routine neuropathological practice. It is likely that molecular subtyping of central nervous system metastases will play an increasing role in the future. In accordance with the recommendations of Inca (French national cancer institute), the pathologist develops appropriate strategies for molecular and immunohistochemical analysis, in order to provide results as soon as possible.

Analyses were led by a multidisciplinary working group established within the unit with the guidance of a quality engineer. First, a mapping of hazardous situations was developed as a result of interactions between the patient workflow for a treatment using PDR brachytherapy split into 51 sub-phases with a comprehensive list of the hazards that he\/she faces (44). Interactions, when relevant, were sorted by level of priority: to be treated immediately, secondarily (the group is not entitled to treat the situation), or later (safe situation). Secondly, for each high priority dangerous situation, scenarios were developed to anticipate their potential consequences. Criticality was assessed, using likelihood and severity scales and a matrix, which allocated risks into categories: acceptable (C1), tolerable under control (C2) and unacceptable (C3). Then, corrective actions were proposed and planned when relevant, after assessment of their feasibility with a scale of effort. Finally, the criticality of the scenarios was reevaluated, taking into account the implementation of these actions, leading to a residual risk mapping, which could trigger additional proposals of actions. Two thousand one hundred and eighty-four potential interactions between the list of hazards and the workflow were analyzed. Mapping of dangerous situations identified 213 relevant interactions, from which 61 were considered with high priority. One hundred and twenty-six scenarios were generated: 68 with a low criticality (74.3%), 58 with an intermediate score (25.7%). No scenario with the highest criticality was individualized. Twenty-one corrective actions were planned. Mapping of residual risk resulted in the disappearance of most C2 risks, leaving 5 C2 scenarios (4%), for which four monitoring indicators were implemented in addition to the corrected actions decided on. The implementation of the GRA appeared feasible, and led to implement 21 corrective actions, based on scenarios and not on incidents. ","933":"Stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy after resection of brain metastasis is an alternative to whole brain radiotherapy. A high dose per fraction is associated with a risk of radiation necrosis. We present four cases of confirmed histological radiation necrosis. Differentiating recurrent tumour from radiation necrosis in this scenario is challenging. An enhancing area in magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) with a \"cut bell pepper\" appearance may suggest radiation necrosis. Advanced imaging modalities such as perfusion MR imaging and positron emission tomography can be useful. Dosimetric predictors of the occurrence of radiation necrosis after stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy are poorly understood and require prospective studies on larger cohorts.

When a raised carcinoembryonic antigen level is found, salivary gland malignancies should be taken into the differential diagnosis and clinical examination of the head and neck region should not be overlooked. ","936":"Prospective evaluation of sexual function after treatment of rectal cancer and identification of predictive factors. Thirty-three patients were treated with curative intent by chemoradiation and surgery for localized rectal adenocarcinoma. Sexual toxicity was assessed four times (before treatment and at 2, 6 and 12 months) using validated questionnaires: QLQ C30 and EORTC CR38 for all, simplified IIEF for men and FSFI for women. A correlation was sought between the toxicity and clinical and dosimetric parameters by Fisher and Mann-Whitney tests. In men, erections and sexual satisfaction decreased significantly from the acute phase and then stabilized (respective scores of 84.5 and 86\/100 in the initial phase, 66 and 70.4 at the end of radiotherapy, 70 and 70 at 6 months and 68.5 and 70 at 12 months). For women, the changes were not significant. This study confirms some risk factors for sexual toxicity already mentioned (original function, age, tumor volume) and highlights new (dose to the seminal vesicles and above all, doses to pelvic autonomic plexus). Sexual effects of combined treatment of rectal cancer have only recently been described but remain undervalued and poorly understood. The impact of the autonomic pelvic plexus doses is a completely new data that could be extended in the development of intensity-modulated radiotherapy. ","937":"The thermoplastic mask often used to immobilize patients in radiotherapy can cause varying levels of stress and anxiety. This study aimed at evaluating the anxiety related to the use of radiotherapy masks and the coping strategies adopted by patients. Nineteen patients treated with radiotherapy mask for head and neck cancer, a brain tumour or a lymphoma, were met twice by a psychologist, either after the making of the mask and the first course of radiotherapy, or in the middle and at the end of treatment. Thirty-four semi-structured interviews were treated using a thematic content analysis and 13 patients answered to anxiety (STAI-YB) and coping (WCC) scales. The STAI-YB anxiety scores related to wearing the masks were low during the radiotherapy treatment period, and were confirmed by the remarks of patients recorded during the semi-structured interviews. Most patients had a positive perception of the mask, and considered it as a friend or protection. Twelve out of the 13 patients admitting to anxiety benefited from problem focused coping strategies. Thermoplastic mask-related anxiety is low and possibly lies in the positive representation patients have about the mask. The explanations provided by health professionals on the radiotherapy mask possibly have a very positive effect on this perception. ","938":"Radical cystectomy with lymphadenectomy is currently the standard of care for muscle-invasive urothelial bladder cancer; however and because of its morbidity and its impact on quality of life, there is a growing tendency for bladder-sparing strategies. Initially reserved for elderly or unfit patients unable to undergo radical cystectomy, chemoradiotherapy became a true alternative to surgery for highly selected patients. Although there are no randomized trials comparing radical cystectomy with bladder preserving approaches, surgery remains the preferred treatment for many clinicians. Furthermore, comparison is even more difficult as modalities of radiotherapy are not consensual and differ between centers with a variability of protocols, volume of irradiation and type of chemotherapy. Several ongoing trials are attempting to optimize chemoradiotherapy and limit its toxicity, especially through techniques of adaptive radiotherapy or targeted therapies. ","939":"Primary central nervous system lymphoma is a rare extranodal form of non-Hodgkin lymphoma with an aggressive course and unsatisfactory outcome. Historically, whole-brain radiotherapy was the sole treatment for patients with primary central nervous system lymphoma, with high response rates but typically, this did not result in long-lasting remissions. The addition of high-dose methotrexate-based chemotherapy regimens to whole-brain radiotherapy has significantly improved patients' outcome, but has resulted in a higher incidence of late neurotoxicity, particularly in elderly patients. To date, the role of consolidation radiotherapy is controversial, and some investigators have developed alternative strategies aiming at avoiding immediate irradiation or using a reduced radiotherapy dose to the whole-brain with promising results.

Between May 2010 and December 2012, 169 patients with localized prostate cancer had an intraprostatic fiducial marker implantation under transrectal ultrasound guidance. The procedure included prophylactic antibiotic therapy, fleet enema, implantation performed by trained radiation oncologists at our center prior to image-guided radiotherapy. Toxicity occurring between implantation and subsequent radiotherapy start date was assessed. The following parameters were analyzed via medical chart review: antibiotic therapy, anticoagulant interruption, bleeding, pain, prostate volume, number of markers implanted, post-implantation complications and delay before starting radiotherapy. Of the 169 men, 119 (70.4%) underwent insertion of 4 fiducial markers and the other 50 (29.6%) had 3. The procedure was well-tolerated. There was no interruption of the implantation with regards to pain or hemorrhage. No grade 3 or 4 complications were observed. Seed migration rate was 0.32%, for the migration of 2 markers on 626 implanted. Mean prostate volume was 38 cm(3) (range: 10-150 cm(3)). Two patients (1.18%) developed a urinary tract infection following the procedure: prostate volume of 25 and 65 cm(3), four gold seed markers implanted, urinary tract infection resistant to prophylactic antibiotherapy, and treated with antibiotics specific to their infection as determined on urine culture. Transrectal fiducial marker implantation for image-guided radiotherapy in prostate cancer is a well-tolerated procedure without major associated complications. ","941":"Radiotherapy is advocated in the treatment of cancer of over 50 % of patients. It has long been considered as a focal treatment only. However, the observation of effects, such as fatigue and lymphopenia, suggests that systemic effects may also occur. The description of bystander and abscopal effects suggests that irradiated cells may exert an action on nearby or distant unirradiated cells, respectively. A third type of effect that involves feedback interactions between irradiated cells was more recently described (cohort effect). This new field of radiation therapy is yet poorly understood and the definitions suffer from a lack of reproducibility in part due to the variety of experimental models. The bystander effect might induce genomic instability in non-irradiated cells and is thus extensively studied for a potential risk of radiation-induced cancer. From a therapeutic perspective, reproducing an abscopal effect by using a synergy between ionizing radiation and immunomodulatory agents to elicit or boost anticancer immune responses is an interesting area of research. Many applications are being developed in particular in the field of hypofractionated stereotactic irradiation of metastatic disease.","942":"The purpose was to assess three treatments planning techniques including one in intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for cerebral irradiation of pregnant woman, in order to limit the dose delivered to the foetus. The treatment provided was 60 Gy to the planning target volume. Estimated foetal dose was measured using an anthropomorphic phantom, on the upper and middle part of the uterus. The first plan consisted in four beams in conformational technique delivered from a Varian accelerator with a 120 leaves collimator, the second one used non-coplanar fields and the third one assessed IMRT. With the conformational technique, the dose at the upper part of the uterus was 8.3 mGy and 6.3 mGy at the middle part. The dose delivered to the foetus was higher with the non-coplanar fields. In IMRT, the dose at the upper part of the uterus was 23.8 mGy and 14.3 mGy at the middle part. The three plans used 6 MV X-rays. Because of the use of leaves and non-coplanar fields, IMRT does not seem to be the optimal technique for the treatment of pregnant woman. However, the dose delivered to the foetus remains low and below the dose of 100 mGy recommended by the International Commission of Radiological Protection. It seems possible to consider the use of this technique for a better sparing of organs at risk for the mother.","943":"To compare the efficacy of intensity-modulated radiotherapy, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, and conventional radiotherapy for cervical cancer treatment. Whole pelvis intensity-modulated radiotherapy, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, and conventional radiotherapy plans were designed for 16 patients with stage IIB cervical cancer, each using the prescribed dose of 50.4 Gy\/28 fractions. Dose-volume histograms of the target volume and organs at risk were evaluated. Compared to the 3D conformal and conventional radiotherapy plans, the intensity-modulated radiotherapy plan demonstrated superior conformal treatment. The mean planning target volume dose of all three plans reached the target effective therapeutic dose. The planning target volume dose of the intensity-modulated radiotherapy plan was significantly higher than that of either the three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy or conventional radiotherapy plan (P&lt;0.05). When more than 30 Gy was administered in intensity-modulated radiotherapy, organs at risk including the small intestine, rectum, bladder, and bone marrow received a significantly reduced volume of radiation. In comparison of the average planning target volume doses, significant volume reductions in irradiation of organs at risk were obtained with full bladders. An intensity-modulated radiotherapy plan with appropriate margins encompassing the primary tumour and potential microscopic pelvic disease reduces the dose to organs at risk without compromising target coverage.

The PARP-1, PARP-2 and PARP-3 are the only PARPs known to be activated by DNA damage. The absence of PARP-1 and PARP-2, that are both activated by DNA damage and participate in DNA damage repair processes, results in hypersensitivity to ionizing radiation and alkylating agents. PARP inhibitors that compete with NAD(+) at the enzyme's activity site can be used in BRCA-deficient cells as single agent therapies acting through the principle of synthetic lethality exploiting these cells deficient DNA double-strand break repair. Preclinical data showing an enhancement of the response of tumors to radiation has been documented for several PARP inhibitors. However, whether this is due exclusively to impaired DNA damage responses or whether tumor re-oxygenation contributes to this radio-sensitization via the vasoactive effects of the PARP inhibitors remains to be fully determined. These promising results have paved the way for the evaluation of PARP inhibitors in combination with radiotherapy in phase I and phase II clinical trials for malignant glioma, head and neck, and breast cancers. A number of challenges remain that are also reviewed in this article, including the optimization of treatment schedules for combined therapies and the validation of biomarkers that will identify which patients will most benefit from either PARP inhibitors in combination with radiotherapy.

Patients with unknown histology showed progression-free survival rates of 100%, 98.7%, and 93.5% at 3, 5, and 10 years and patients with biopsy-proven grade I meningioma showed rates of 100% after 3 years, 91.7% after 5 years and 85.9% after 10 years. Patients with adjuvant radiotherapy showed significantly worse progression-free survival rates than patients who had been treated with primary radiotherapy (P=0.043), progression-free survival rates were independent of tumour size. The most common acute grade I symptoms were headache, fatigue, and local alopecia. The most common chronic grade I symptoms were fatigue and headache. This large study showed that fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy is an effective and safe treatment modality with high progression-free survival rates for intracranial meningioma. We identified \"prior surgery\" as significant poor prognostic factor. ","947":"This national survey has measured the working conditions, work engagement, job strain, burn out, and the negative work-home interaction among Belgian radiation oncologists with validated questionnaires. In fact, previous studies had in general shown an interest to burn out and its association with working conditions among oncology workers, but not focused on radiation oncologists in particular. Moreover, few studies concerned work engagement and its association with working conditions although this could be important in preventing burn out. We used the WOrking Conditions and Control Questionnaire, the Positive and Negative Occupational States Inventory, the Maslach Burn out Inventory, and the negative work-home interaction subscale of the Survey Work-home Interaction Nijmegen. One open question asked about problematic job situations. Sixty-six radiation oncologists participated (30% response rate). Median scores of most of working conditions corresponded to normal scores. Control over time management (45.8) was close to low score, while control over future (60.9) was high. Median score of job strain (48.9) was normal, whereas median score of work engagement (60) was high. Median score of burn out was low. The mean of negative work-home interactions (1.1) was higher than the mean of 0.84 in a reference sample (t=4.3; P&lt;0.001). The most frequent problematic situations referred to work organization (e.g. time pressure) and specific resources (e.g. chief support). Radiation oncologists showed a very high level of work engagement and experienced several job resources. However, some resources (as supervisor support) were missing and needed to be developed. These results were discussed in the context of motivational process described in the Job Demands-Resources Model.

Prospective analysis based on an anonymous survey filled by 104 radiation oncologists. A total of 30.7% of radiation oncologists surveyed did not consider any trade in their cure rate to preserve their larynx. The median percentage of cure that they were willing to trade was 10% (2-100%); and 0.9% of them were willing to trade 100% of their chance for cure in order to \"avoid\" total laryngectomy. A total of 16.3% of radiation oncologists would like to receive more information before making their decision. The additional information most frequently requested concerned the precise stage of the tumour and the potential remedial treatment in case of failure of the laryngeal preservation protocol. None of the analysed demographic variables influenced the choice to trade or not survival chance to preserve the larynx, the percentage of chance that radiation oncologists would consider exchanging, and\/or the wish to receive additional information. This prospective study highlights that larynx preservation protocol is not the main therapeutic goal shared by all radiation oncologists put in a position of being diagnosed with an advanced stage cancer of the larynx. Total laryngectomy should remain a treatment option that as organ preservation protocols to be proposed and discussed.

This tumour is characterized by a tendency to local invasion, and rare distant metastases. Well treated, the prognosis is excellent. We describe a case of low-grade nasal cavity adenocarcinoma and discuss the anatomoclinical, therapeutic and evolutionary characteristics of this malignant tumour. A 54-year-old female patient presented with a 10 years history of right-sided nasal obstruction and recurrent epistaxis. On examination the patient had a large, firm mass in the right nasal cavity. Endoscopic sinonasal surgery was performed. The lesion was found to originate from the posteriolateral wall of the right nasal cavity. Histopathology analysis identified a low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinoma. Upon follow-up 4 years after surgery, the patient exhibited no clinical evidence of recurrence. Low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinomas are poorly defined neoplasms, accounting for 4 to 20% of all sinonasal malignancies. The nasal cavity is the most frequently involved site. Low-grade sinonasal adenocarcinomas pose a diagnostic challenge for the pathologist because they must be distinguished from benign tumours, especially adenomas. The primary treatment of sinonasal adenocarcinoma is complete surgical excision.","952":null,"953":null,"954":"Intensity modulated radiotherapy is increasingly used in non-small-cell lung cancers despite a low level of evidence. A literature review was conducted. Several critical physical and dosimetric uncertainties are however unsolved. Methods to circumvent these limitations are being developed. In several retrospective studies, survival rates were at least similar with intensity-modulated radiotherapy as those reported with three-dimensional irradiation. To date, intensity modulated radiotherapy might be authorized in complex anatomical situations such as tumours close to the spinal cord (such as Pancoast Tobias, paraspinal and paracardiac tumours) or with limited motion amplitudes. Dosimetric benefits should also account for 4D dose distribution issues. The reduction of intermediate and high doses in the organs at risk with intensity modulated radiotherapy is advantageous. However, the effect of low doses in large volumes (lung, bone, unspecified tissues along beam paths) and the effect of increasing integral dose are still poorly known. In conclusion, dose-volume correlations need to be better documented and prospective randomized trials should be encouraged. ","955":"In 2014, the production of iridium 192 wires in France ended. Thus brachytherapy departments had to move to high-dose rate and pulsed-dose rate afterloading techniques. Most of them had already made this migration for some indications, based on the habits and investments. The brachytherapy group organised meetings and opened discussions to share the clinical knowledge and answer to the questions raised by this migration. This made it possible to resolve and describe quite all the clinical and technical cases of brachytherapy. The development of high technology included the use of 3D dosimetry and optimisation of dose distribution and fractionation. The teaching policy of new technologies contributes to the improvement of treatment quality. Last but not least, a better reimbursement of brachytherapy is necessary and currently negotiated. ","956":"This review updates the radiotherapy indications for non-malignant diseases, except those treated by radiosurgery. Since the last 2005 review, there have been no major changes in the indications: the prevention of heteropic bone formation and keloids remain classical indications, while the treatment of macular degeneration or the prevention of coronary restenosis are now past history. Nevertheless, the radiation treatment for benign diseases should have the same criteria as for malignant diseases: information of the patient on risks, benefits and treatment quality. ","957":"Radiotherapy is used for inoperable lung cancers, sometimes in association with chemotherapy. Outcomes of conventional radiotherapy are disappointing. New techniques improve adaptation to tumour volume, decrease normal tissue irradiation and lead to increasing tumour dose with the opportunity for improved survival. With intensity-modulated radiation therapy, isodoses can conform to complex volumes. It is widely used and seems to be indicated in locally advanced stages. Its dosimetric improvements have been demonstrated but outcomes are still heterogeneous. Stereotactic radiotherapy allows treatment of small volumes with many narrow beams. Dedicated devices or appropriate equipment on classical devices are needed. In early stages, its efficacy is comparable to surgery with an acceptable toxicity. Endobronchial brachytherapy could be used for early stages with specific criteria. Hadrontherapy is still experimental regarding lung cancer. Hadrons have physical properties leading to very accurate dose distribution. In the rare published studies, toxicities are roughly lower than others techniques but for early stages its effectiveness is not better than stereotactic radiotherapy. These techniques are optimized by metabolic imaging which precisely defines the target volume and assesses the therapeutic response; image-guided radiation therapy which allows a more accurate patient set up and by respiratory tracking or gating which takes account of tumour respiratory motions. ","958":"The cervico-thoracic-abdominal-pelvic CT-scan is a key examination of the staging of esophagus cancers. Anatomical and pathophysiological knowledge of the lymph nodes is an essential tool to establish a precise mapping. Imaging tests (such endoscopic ultrasound and PET scanning) will be very useful to determine clinical options and clinical target volume delineation for the radiotherapy of esophagus cancers. ","959":"Thoracic radiotherapy is a usual treatment for lung cancer. Early-stages may be treated in stereotactic mode while locally advanced stages are usually treated with conventional radiotherapy mode. Pulmonary function tests show that thoracic irradiation has no impact on lung volume such as forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV1) or forced vital capacity (FCV). However, some studies found that CO (carbon monoxide) diffusing capacity (TLCO) may be altered under thoracic radiotherapy. DLCO alteration is usually symptomatic of either a lesion in the alveolar membrane or a pulmonary capillary alteration. Pulmonary diffusion may be also appreciated by the NO (azote monoxide) diffusion capacity. Moreover, using a double measurement of NO and CO diffusing capacities permit to assess which lung compartment (capillary or membrane) is affected. CONORT is an observational prospective monocentric study, aiming to assess the CO and NO diffusing capacity (as well as other pulmonary function tests) during thoracic radiotherapy. Inclusion criteria are patients with lung cancer, treated by thoracic radiotherapy (conformational or stereotactic), who signed consent. Pulmonary function tests are performed before, during, at the end and six weeks and six months after thoracic irradiation. To estimate a difference of 15% in diffusing capacity test, we have to include 112 patients with a 90% power and a 5% alpha risk. Four months after beginning, 36 patients were included. Preliminary data will be presented at the SFRO meeting.","960":"Patient information duties are a basic task of radiation oncologists in their daily practice. This article is essentially a factsheet on legal obligations, the value of written informed consent and information documents that ought to be given to patient. ","961":"Esophageal cancer has a high likelihood of distant lymphatic spread even at an early stage. Radiotherapy plays a major role in the management of localized or locally-advanced esophageal cancer with a regional or distant lymph node involvement. Radiotherapy can sterilize micrometastatic nodes and cancer cells in transit in the peri-esophageal fat that are not removed by surgery. After preoperative chemoradiotherapy followed by monobloc esophagectomy including lymph node dissection above and below the diaphragm, the locoregional failure rate was around 3% in the Chemoradiotherapy for Esophageal Cancer followed by Surgery Study Group (CROSS) trial. This is significantly lower than that observed with surgery alone or following exclusive chemoradiotherapy delivering 50 Gy over 5 weeks. Patterns of failure usually combine local and nodal failure. These results suggest that: (1) radiotherapy plays a major role in the management of micrometastatic nodes that are not removed by surgery; (2) the total dose of radiotherapy without surgery may be too low to control macroscopic disease. Better knowledge of regional failure sites and the enhancement of clinical practices through homogenized nodal radiotherapy could lead to a decrease in regional relapses, but at the expense of irradiated volumes greater than the macroscopic tumor volume. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy or volumetric modulated arctherapy makes it possible to increase mediastinal irradiated volumes while effectively protecting healthy tissues.","962":"Gliomas are the most frequent primary brain tumors. Their care is difficult because of the proximity of organs at risk. The treatment of glioblastoma includes surgery followed by chemoradiation with the protocol of Stupp et al. The addition of bevacizumab allows an increase in progression-free survival by 4 months but it does not improve overall survival. This treatment is reserved for clinical trials. Intensity modulation radiotherapy may be useful to reduce the neurocognitive late effects in different types of gliomas. In elderly patients an accelerated radiotherapy 40 Gy in 15 fractions allows a similar survival to standard radiotherapy. O(6)-methylguanine-DNA methyltransferase (MGMT) status may help to choose between chemotherapy and radiotherapy. There is no standard for the treatment of recurrent gliomas. Re-irradiation in stereotactic conditions allows a median survival of 8 to 12.4 months. Anaplastic gliomas with 1p19q mutation have a greater sensibility to chemotherapy by procarbazine, lomustine and vincristine. Chemoradiotherapy in these patients has become the standard treatment. Many studies are underway testing targeted therapies, their place in the therapeutic management and new radiotherapy techniques.","963":"In 2007, a first edition was published with the objective to produce guidelines for optimization, harmonization and homogenization of practices in external radiation therapy in France. The second edition, including brachytherapy, has the same objective and takes into account recent technologic improvements (intensity modulation radiation therapy, stereotactic radiotherapy, and 3-dimension brachytherapy) and recent results of the literature. The first part is about daily use of general principles (quality, security, image-guided radiation therapy) and the second is to describe each step of treatment of main cancers.

Nevertheless, although the clinical toxicity rate is less than 5%, postradiation radiological reactions surrounding the tumour, called \"radiological radiation pneumonitis\", are very frequent, which makes it difficult to evaluate the tumour response. Firstly, this review describes the lesions of acute and chronic radiation pneumonitis and the CT images suggesting a local recurrence.

The Brachytherapy Group of the French society of radiation oncology (GC-SFRO) has recommended switching from iridium wires to after-loading machines. Two types of after-loading machines are currently available, based on the dose rate used: pulsed-dose rate or high-dose rate. In this article, we propose a comparative analysis between pulsed-dose rate and high-dose rate brachytherapy, based on biological, technological, organizational and financial considerations.","968":null,"969":"In 2013, about 6000 patients were treated with brachytherapy, the number diminishing by 2.6% per year since 2008. Prostate, breast and gynecological cancers are the most common types of cancers. Since 2008, the number of brachytherapy facilities has decreased by 18%. In medicoeconomic terms, brachytherapy faces many problems: the coding system is outdated; brachytherapy treatments cost as much as internal radiation; fees do not cover costs; since iridium wire has disappeared from the market, the technique will be transferred to more expensive high-speed or pulse dose rates. The French financing grid based on the national study of costs lags behind changes in such treatments and in the best of cases, hospitals resorting to alternatives such as in-hospital brachytherapy are funded at 46% of their additional costs. Brachytherapy is a reference technique. With intense pressure on hospital pricing, financing brachytherapy facilities will become even more problematic as a consequence of the disappearance of iridium 192 wires. The case of brachytherapy illustrates the limits of the French financing system and raises serious doubts as to its responsiveness.","970":"Major improvements in the field of radiotherapy planning such as stereotactic radiation therapy, have recently been performed, aiming to the development of personalized therapeutic strategies in patients with biochemical failure of prostate cancer. However, this needs an early and accurate location of sites of recurrence. Development of multimodality magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and positron emission tomography (PET) permits to consider this objective. Thus, it is worthwhile to apprehend the respective performance of these imaging techniques in order to rationalize their use. We propose a review of the recent literature organized by technique and by location, regarding the performance of multimodality MRI and PET for restaging of patients with biochemical failure of prostate cancer initially treated with curative intent.

This treatment constitutes a therapeutic progress in the management of many tumours, especially hepatic ones. If surgery remains the standard local therapy, stereotactic radiotherapy is first dedicated to inoperable patients or unresectable tumours. Patients with moderately altered general status, preserved liver function and tumour lesions limited in number as in size are eligible to this technique. Results in terms of local control are satisfying, regarding primary tumours (notably hepatocellular carcinomas) as metastases stemming from various origins. If treatment protocols and follow-up modalities are not standardized to this day, iconographic acquisition using four-dimensional computed tomography, target volumes delineation based on morphological and\/or metabolic data, and image-guided radiotherapy contribute to an oncologic efficacy and an improved sparing of the functional liver.

Technical particularities of this radiation modality will also be described. ","972":null,"973":"Evidence-based medicine is a paradigm founded on a hierarchy of research design, accepted as a dogma. Applied to radiation oncology, and specifically to radiotherapy technical comparisons, evidence-based medicine implies methodological and ethical problems. The concept of \"incremental\" evolution and the dosimetric evidence are proposed as an acceptable alternative to comparative clinical trials if total dose, time, fractionation, and target volumes are not modified. For other situations, either randomized comparative trials or observational studies are needed. When randomized comparative trials are not possible, observational studies, whose validity can be enhanced by appropriate methodology, must be considered as a valid method.

Cervical lymph node surgery is systematized and drainage areas are sectorized with an increasingly conservative attitude.

The traditional dissection is reserved to the lymph in capsular rupture or cervical interstitial mass. ","975":"Even in the current era of dose-escalated radiotherapy for prostate cancer, biochemical recurrence is not uncommon. Furthermore, biochemical failure is not specific to the site of recurrence. One of the major challenges in the management of prostate cancer patients with biochemical failure after radiotherapy is the early discrimination between those with locoregional recurrence only and those with metastatic disease. While the latter are generally considered incurable, patients with locoregional disease may benefit from emerging treatment options. Ultimately, the objective of salvage therapy is to control disease while ensuring minimal collateral damage, thereby optimizing both cancer and toxicity outcomes. Advances in functional imaging, including multiparametric prostate MRI, abdominopelvic lymphangio-MRI, sentinel node SPECT-CT and\/or whole-body PET\/CT have paved the way for salvage radiotherapy in patients with local recurrence, microscopic nodal disease limited to the pelvis or oligometastatic disease. These patients may be considered for salvage reirradiation using different techniques: prostate low-dose or high-dose rate brachytherapy, pelvic and\/or lomboaortic image-guided radiotherapy with elective nodal irradiation, focal nodal or bone stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). An individualized approach is recommended. The decision about which treatment, if any, to use will be based on the initial characteristics of the disease, relapse patterns and the natural history of the rising prostate specific antigen (PSA). Preliminary results suggest that more than 50% of patients who have undergone salvage reirradiation are biochemically relapse-free with very low rates of severe toxicity. Large prospective studies with a longer follow-up are needed to confirm the promising benefit\/risk ratio observed with salvage brachytherapy and or salvage nodal radiotherapy and\/or bone oligometastatic SBRT when compared with life-long palliative hormones.

Intensity-modulated radiation therapy is also a costly technique that necessitates a numerous staff, highly trained, with regular practice. If this technique cannot be available (understaffing, overwork, etc.) the choice between entrusting the patient to a colleague and treating the patient with a less sophisticated technique such as 3-dimensional conformal radiation therapy depends on different objective and ethical criteria.

The MEDLINE database was searched to identify relevant information with the following medical subject headings: \"prostate cancer\", \"radiotherapy\" and \"biochemical relapse\". Prognostic factors affecting the overall survival of patients with a biochemical relapse after external beam radiotherapy have been identified: short prostate specific antigen (PSA)-doubling time (&lt; 12 months), high PSA value (&gt; 10 ng\/mL) and short interval between treatment and biochemical relapse (&lt; 18 months). If a second local treatment is not feasible, timing to initiate a salvage medical treatment is not defined. Particularly, randomized trials did not demonstrate a significant benefit of an early initiation of androgen deprivation treatment. Some retrospective studies suggest that an early androgen deprivation is justified if poor prognostic factors are found. However, if an androgen deprivation treatment is prescribed, intermittent schedule is non-inferior to a continuous administration and seems to offer a better quality of life. Many non-hormonal treatments have also been evaluated in this setting: only 5-alpha-reductase inhibitors could be proposed in some specific situations. In conclusion, the judicious use of a medical treatment for biochemical relapse is still debated. Given the natural history of this clinical situation, a simple surveillance is justified in many cases.","980":"Radiotherapy based on functional imaging consists to deliver a heterogeneity dose based on biological proprieties. This approach is termed biologically conformal radiotherapy or dose painting with biological target volume inside the gross tumor volume. Diffusion-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) and dynamic contrast-enhanced MRI can also be used to define a specific biological target volume. Three main tracers are used: ((18)F)-fluorodeoxyglucose to target the hypermetabolism, ((18)F)-fluoromizonidazole and ((18)F)- fluoroazomycin arabinoside to target areas of hypoxia. In this review, we give a practical approach to achieving a treatment-guided radiotherapy molecular and the main issues raised by this imaging technique.

The first step of the process is crucial. It is related to the validation of the indication proposed during the multidisciplinary meeting as regard the evidence-based proof of the concept. These emerging techniques mainly extracranial stereotactic body irradiation do not benefit from long-term evaluation in terms of efficiency as well as normal tissue late toxicities. Priority should be given to prospective independent clinical trials, validated by an independent scientific committee, performed under a relevant and well dedicated multicentric quality assurance program aiming to improve knowledge and selection of indications.

First, it can be used to refine the way nodal and primary tumour target volumes are selected and delineated, in better agreement with the underlying tumour reality. In addition, the non-invasive spatiotemporal mapping of the tumour biology and the organs at risk function might be further used to steer radiation dose distribution. Delivering higher dose to low responsive tumour area, in a way that better preserves the normal tissue function, should thus reconcile the tumour radiobiological imperatives (maximising tumour local control) with dose related to the treatment safety (minimising late toxicity). By predicting response early in the course of radiation therapy, PET may also participate to better select patients who are believed to benefit most from treatment intensification. Altogether, these technological advances open avenues to in-depth modify the way the treatment plan is designed and the dose is delivered, in better accordance with the radiobiology of individual solid cancers and normal tissues.

In recent years, brachytherapy has become ever more sophisticated thanks to a multitude of technological developments, including high-dose rate afterloading machines, image-guidance, and advanced planning systems. One of the advantages of brachytherapy, apart from the well-known capability of delivering highly conformal doses directly to the target, is that it is highly adaptable and can be used as a primary, adjunct, or salvage treatment. However, despite the existence of international treatment guidelines, the clinical practice of brachytherapy varies greatly by region, country, and even institution. In the present article, we provide an overview of recent findings from the Patterns of Care for Brachytherapy in Europe (PCBE) Study and we discuss new technologies used in brachytherapy and the emerging concept of \"new biology\" that supports the use of high-dose brachytherapy.

Local recurrence is observed on average in 30% of cases several years following irradiation. A key challenge is to determine the site of recurrence and imaging (MRI and PET choline) coupled to prostate biopsies are important to confirm the local character. Salvage therapy performed by the urologist can then control the situation. Radical prostatectomy subject to strict technical conditions is one of the most efficient local treatments, however it comes at the cost of significant urinary morbidity; minimally invasive therapies (focused ultrasound and cryotherapy) have also their place in specific indications. Each clinical situation should be discussed in pluridisciplinary meetings integrating the oncologic and functional status at recurrence, the risk\/benefit ratio of each treatment, the patient's wishes and probability of survival.

Three randomised trials (French, European-EORTC, Canadian) have been recently published or presented. The French trial did not show any benefit for internal mammary chain irradiation, but it was probably underpowered. The EORTC and Canadian trials demonstrated an improvement in overall survival after lymph nodes irradiation, including the internal mammary chain. The absolute benefit is 1.6% (hazard ratio-0.88 in a recent meta-analysis). Because this benefit is limited, it is important to define the characteristics of the patients who may benefit from this irradiation. Analyses of the randomized trials are not complete, and it is difficult at this moment to accurately define this population. However, cardiac and pulmonary toxicity of lymph nodes irradiation is well known. For each patient, evaluation of the potential late toxicity must be evaluated and so an accurate dosimetry for critical organs must be performed: the indication of internal mammary chain irradiation depends of the benefit\/risk ratio.

Potential benefits are well known: decrease of treatment toxicity, improvement of efficacy through better dose delivery. But the implementation of this technique requires a careful target and organs at risk delineation.

","994":"Cervical cancer, although less common in industrialized countries, is the fourth most common cancer affecting women worldwide and the fourth leading cause of cancer death. In developing countries, these cancers are often discovered at a later stage in the form of locally advanced tumour with a poor prognosis. Depending on the stage of the disease, treatment is mainly based on a chemoradiotherapy followed by uterovaginal brachytherapy ending by a potential remaining tumour surgery or in principle for some teams. The role of irradiation is crucial to ensure a better local control. It has been shown that the more the delivered dose is important, the better the local results are. In order to preserve the maximum of organs at risk and to allow this dose escalation, brachytherapy (intracavitary and\/or interstitial) has been progressively introduced. Its evolution and its progressive improvement have led to the development of high dose rate brachytherapy, the advantages of which are especially based on the possibility of outpatient treatment while maintaining the effectiveness of other brachytherapy forms (i.e., low dose rate or pulsed dose rate). Numerous innovations have also been completed in the field of imaging, leading to a progress in treatment planning systems by switching from two-dimensional form to a three-dimensional one. Image-guided brachytherapy allows more precise target volume delineation as well as an optimized dosimetry permitting a better coverage of target volumes. ","995":"Head and neck cancer is frequently associated with alcohol and tobacco consumption but there is an increasing incidence of oropharyngeal carcinoma associated with oncogenic type-16 human papillomavirus (HPV). The clinical profile of these patients is distinct from that of other patients, with an earlier onset, 1\/1 male to female sex ratio, cystic cervical nodes. Detection of intratumoral viral DNA is essential to confirm the role of HPV. According to several reports, the prognosis in terms of survival and locoregional control is better in HPV-positive oropharyngeal carcinoma than in HPV-negative oropharyngeal carcinoma or associated with tobacco consumption. The future lies in vaccination of women against cervical cancer but vaccination of boys will be certainly necessary. ","996":"","997":"Stereotactic radiotherapy is increasingly used in head and neck tumours, either as a boost for dose escalation\/early salvage, or in the reirradiation setting. We aimed to assess the level of evidence for each clinical setting and to discuss the different dose and frationation regimens. A search of the French and English literature was performed on PubMed until December 2013. Stereotactic reirradiation of locally recurrent squamous cell carcinomas can be performed with overall survival rates of about 12 months with good quality of life, and acceptable toxicity, based on several phase 2 trials and retrospective studies. Nasopharyngeal carcinomas may be irradiated with even better control rates. Late severe toxicities yield up to 20-30%. Patient and tumour selection criteria (limited volume) and dose constraints to the carotids (cumulative dose 110 Gy or less, to avoid the risk of potentially lethal carotid blowout) must be carefully chosen. Fractionated regimens (at least five fractions) should be preferred (30 Gy in five fractions to 36 Gy in six fractions). Methods derived from stereotactic, intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) may be used with conventional fractionation for larger tumours. Stereotactic irradiation may be associated with cetuximab; data with chemotherapy or other targeted therapies are still lacking. Stereotactic irradiation is also used as a boost after 46 Gy IMRT in several institutions or for early salvage (8 to 10 weeks following full dose irradiation with evidence of residual tumour) in squamous or nasopharyngeal carcinomas. Such indications should be evaluated prospectively in clinical trials. Data in salivary gland and sinonasal neoplasms are still scarce. In conclusion, stereotactic body radiation therapy has the potential as a boost or in the reirradiation setting to improve local control in head and neck tumours. Careful hypofractionation with planning caring for the dose to the main vessels is highly recommended. Prospective studies with prolonged follow-up (at least 2 years) should be encouraged.","998":"The clinical management of systemic treatments and irradiation has long been studied for conventional irradiation. Yet, many associations are of difficult management and some drugs are contra-indicated in the concomitant setting owing to excessive toxicities. Sequential regimens using a therapeutic window of variable duration (based on drug half-life and tissue wash out) between each modality may be preferred for easier logistics and to avoid toxicities. The use of intra- and extracranial stereotactic ablative radiation therapy (hypofractionated) is expanding rapidly. Yet, little is known regarding associations between stereotactic ablative radiation therapy and systemic treatments. The short stereotactic ablative radiation therapy course in one day to two weeks offers a theoretical advantage compared to longer conventional irradiation with respect to shorter discontinuation of therapy. This may be of particular interest in situations where cancer is addicted to systemic treatment. While it is believed that stereotactic ablative radiation therapy might be safer because of limited irradiation volumes and steep gradients sparing most organs at risk, it should be noted that irradiation of normal tissues cannot be considered null; that stereotactic ablative radiation therapy has vascular effects in addition to other cell death radiation-induced mechanisms and cancer progression with discontinuation of systemic treatment is often reversible. To date, based on several phase II studies, combined stereotactic ablative radiation therapy and cetuximab can be recommended in head and neck tumours. Other stereotactic ablative radiation therapy-based combinations require prospective phase I-II studies and sufficient therapeutic window (in the order of at least 5 half-lives) between the systemic and local modalities must be left in routine practice.","999":"The principles governing stereotactic body radiation therapy are tight margins and large dose gradients around targets. Every step of treatment preparation and delivery must be evaluated before applying this technique in the clinic. Uncertainties remain in each of these steps: delineation, prescription with the biological equivalent dose, treatment planning, patient set-up taking into account movements, the machine accuracy. The calculation of margins to take into account uncertainties differs from conventional radiotherapy because of the delivery of few fractions and large dose gradients around the target. The quest of high accuracy is complicated by the difficulty to reach it and the lack of consensus regarding the prescription. Many schemes dose\/number of fractions are described in clinical studies and there are differences in the way describing the delivered doses. While waiting for the ICRU report dedicated to this technique, it seems desirable to use the quantities proposed in ICRU Report 83 (IMRT) to report the dose distribution. ","1000":"In the frame of treatment de-escalation and personalization, accelerated partial breast irradiation is taking its place in the breast cancer therapeutic options. This study analyzed the results of phase III randomized trials having compared accelerated partial breast irradiation versus whole breast irradiation. Currently, among those trails, six proposed some results regarding efficacy and\/or toxicity. Globally, the non-randomized studies confirmed the expected results showing a low rate of local recurrence and toxicity. The first results of the phase III randomized trials showed encouraging data in terms of local control while the toxicity varied mainly according to the accelerated partial breast irradiation technique used. However, the follow-up of the majority of these studies remains insufficient. The strict respect of accelerated partial breast irradiation indications likely represents one of the key factors of the therapeutic success. The next results could allow proposing a better definition of the accelerated partial breast irradiation selection criteria.

Hereby, we present the first patient treated by radiotherapy with concurrent everolimus, a mTor inhibitor, for a reirradiation of metastasis invading left axillary, infraclavicular and supraclavicular lymph nodes in progression despite several lines of chemotherapy. After 6 months of follow-up, this association provided a satisfactory anti-tumor efficiency and tolerance. Nevertheless, clinical trials are needed in order to confirm this strategy for the treatment of gastric cancer metastasis.","1003":"Recent improvements in radiation therapy delivery techniques provide new tools to treat patients with liver-confined disease, either with hepatocellular carcinoma or liver metastases. An appropriate selection of the patients made during a multidisciplinary specialized tumour board is mandatory. It should be based on the disease extension, an accurate evaluation of the comorbidities and the liver functions. The added value of this approach has to be evaluated in well-designed trials, alone or in combination with other treatments such as surgery, local treatments, chemoembolization and\/or chemotherapy with or without targeted agents. Stereotactic body radiation therapy should be applied under strict conditions of expertise of the radiation oncology departments, including equipment and educational training programmes. However under these conditions, preliminary results seems highly encouraging in terms of local control and tolerance but should be confirmed in large controlled prospective trials. ","1004":"Stereotactic radiotherapy is a new option in the treatment of prostate cancer. However, only retrospective series and a few prospective phase II trials are available at this moment, including a few thousands of patients with a short follow-up. Most of the protocols delivered 33 to 38 Gy in four or five fractions. Acute toxicity seems to be similar to the one observed after conventional radiotherapy. Late toxicity is less evaluable because of the short follow-up: the rate of radiation-induced proctitis seems low in the published series. Urinary toxicities are not properly evaluated: some series reported a high incidence of urinary complications grade or higher. Most of the patients belong to the D'Amico's favourable group: biochemical controls are equivalent to those observed after conventional irradiation, but the follow-up is often shorter than 5 years and no definitive conclusion could be made about the efficiency of the technique. Data for the intermediate and high risk groups are not mature. In conclusion, stereotactic radiotherapy could strongly modified the management of prostate cancer: some phase III trials have started to confirm the good results reported in preliminary series.","1005":"Potentially curative salvage options for biochemical failure after primary prostatic radiotherapy include salvage radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, high-intensity focused ultrasound and cryotherapy. Salvage cryoablation for recurrent prostate cancer after irradiation failure is currently a well-established therapeutic option, since technical improvements have permitted better oncologic outcomes and lower complications rates over the years. This article reviews surgical technique, oncologic and functional outcomes, as well as morbidity and complications of salvage cryotherapy for local recurrence after external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy for prostate cancer. ","1006":"Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy can deliver high doses of bone metastases while sparing adjacent healthy tissue not only for a decompressive or analgesic purpose, but also to improve the local control of the irradiated region. Various phases I or II studies showed the feasibility of such an approach at the cost of limited toxicity, including during re-irradiation. Hypofractionated stereotactic radiotherapy to oligometastases may also improve the long-term control of metastatic disease. ","1007":"Stereotactic radiotherapy for lung cancer is a technique that is now well established in the therapeutic arsenal. Protocols are effective, with very high local control rate and an acceptable rate of survival if one takes into account the patient's age and comorbidities. Complications are rare. This review of the literature analyses the whole process of the therapeutic indications and future prospects. ","1008":"To quantify the influence on heart dose metrics of prone left-sided whole-breast irradiation in an end-inspiratory phase (PrIN) versus an end-expiratory phase (PrEX). Twenty patients underwent CT-simulation in PrIN and PrEX. Dynamic intensity-modulated radiotherapy was planned for whole-breast irradiation with a median prescription dose of 40.05Gy in 15 fractions and maximal sparing of the organs at risk. Dose-volume parameters were analyzed for heart, left anterior descending coronary artery, ipsilateral lung and both breasts. PrIN consistently reduced (P&lt;0.001) heart and left anterior descending coronary artery dose metrics compared to PrEX. Population averages for maximum and mean heart dose were 6.2Gy and 1.3Gy for PrIN versus 21.4Gy and 2.5Gy for PrEX, respectively. Moreover, a maximum heart dose less than 10Gy was achieved in 80% of patients for PrIN. Target dose distribution, ipsilateral lung and contralateral breast sparing by radiation dose were similar for both procedures. Inspiratory gating consistently reduced heart dose metrics pointing to a possible benefit of breathing-adapted radiotherapy for prone left-sided whole-breast irradiation. ","1009":"Stereotactic radiotherapy is a radiation technique, which is becoming more and more available and applicable for physicians. A good efficacy and safety are observed in clinical practice. However, the radiobiology of ablative radiation is still under question. The radiobiological principles of the 5R have to be discussed. The roles of hypoxia and vascularization, more specifically, angiogenesis and vasculogenesis seem to be dominating. ","1010":"Neuroendocrine carcinoma of the head and neck is a rare entity. The parotid gland is the most commonly affected site. A nasopharyngeal site has not been previously described. We report a 35-year-old patient who consulted for tinnitus and nasal obstruction. The assessment found a nasopharyngeal tumour T4N0M0. The patient underwent 6 cycles of chemotherapy based on VP16 and cisplatin, followed by radiotherapy at a dose of 70 Gy to the nasopharynx and 50 Gy to the neck. The evolution was marked by clinical improvement and radiological stability. Six months after the end of treatment, the patient had a local and meningeal relapse. He received palliative care. He died 19 months after the end of treatment.","1011":"Robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy is a new option to treated unresecable liver tumours. The objectives were to assess the tolerance of this technique, to identify predictive factors for toxicity and evaluate the efficiency of this treatment. From June 2010 to November 2012, robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy was proposed for 56 patients with unresecable hepatocellular carcinomas (23 patients) or hepatic metastases (41 patients). Two or less hepatic lesions, lesion size under 75 mm and WHO score under 3 were selection criteria. The prescribed dose was 45 Gy\/3 fractions or 60 Gy\/3 fractions. The primary end-point was toxicity, using the radiation-induced liver disease definition and to identify predictive factors. Secondary end-points were in-field local control and overall survival. The median follow-up was 12.5 months. The one-year local control rate and the one-year overall survival rate were 64% [CI95%: 48.2 to 76.5%] and 89% [CI95%: 76 to 95%], respectively. For patient treated with a total dose of 60 Gy, no one experienced recurrence. According to the definition we took, radiation-induced liver disease rate was 0 or 9%. A lesion size at least 35 mm was a predictive factor to liver toxicity (P=0.01). Using robotic stereotactic body radiation therapy, the incidence of radiation-induced liver disease is weak and spontaneously reversible. Prospective studies are required to put in evidence other predictive factors of radiation-induced liver disease and confirm the optimal dose treatment. ","1012":"Strereotactic body radiation therapy needs adapted or dedicated equipment to allow fulfilling the particular conditions of the stereotactic treatments: submillimetric accuracy during the treatment delivery, high doses for a reduced number of sessions. This kind of treatment can be either performed using delivery equipment conceived and dedicated to the technique, or performed on conventional machines adapted to meet the criteria. Contrary to intracranial treatments, the positioning of the target volume raises new difficulties, mainly due to the diversity of localization to treat and also due to inter- and intrafraction movements that can occur. To reduce these effects that could affect the irradiation accuracy, positioning or movement compensation, mostly due to respiration, tools have been developed. ","1013":"Indications for adjuvant radiotherapy in breast cancer are defined from the clinical data and the pathological extent of disease in the surgical specimen. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy could modify the pathological characteristics of the tumour, inducing a pathologic complete response in 15 to 50% of cases, challenging the classical indications of adjuvant radiotherapy. The benefit of adjuvant radiotherapy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy was not prospectively evaluated. Nonetheless, from retrospective series, some recommendations with a low level of proof could be given: (i) after lumpectomy, radiotherapy of the mammary gland must be performed even in case of pathologic complete response; (ii) after mastectomy, postoperative radiotherapy is recommended in case of cT3-T4, cN1-3 (clinical or radiological) or pathologically involved nodes; (iii) irradiation of the lymph nodes areas is more questionable, but could be also proposed in case of cN1 or pN1. These recommendations are in accordance with those recently published by the National Cancer Institute and the French National Cancer Institute.","1014":"The main histological types of cervix cancer are squamous cell carcinoma and adenocarcinoma. The glassy cell carcinoma is a rare form found in less than 2% of cases and it is an entity, aggressive and unknown, of worse prognosis, whose current treatment is not distinguished from other histological types. We report the cases of two patients with glassy cell carcinoma of the cervix with a review of the literature.","1015":"Stereotactic body radiation therapy takes more and more an important place in the therapeutic arsenal of primitive and secondary liver tumours. The administration of ablative radiation doses can result in specific changes to both the tumour and the healthy hepatic parenchyma, relative to conventional radiation therapy, making the assessment of local changes after stereotactic body radiation therapy, in terms of local control and reaction of healthy tissue, often difficult. It is mandatory to standardize and simplify our evaluation criteria to benefit from a better understanding of the effectiveness of this new treatment modality and allow better reproducibility of available imaging exams. This article presents a literature review of the various radiological changes observed after stereotactic body radiation therapy for liver tumours according to the multiple assessment methods used to determine local control. From the data available, we recommend using modified RECIST criteria proposed by the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases (AASLD), as objective and relevant criteria of local control after stereotactic body radiation therapy for liver tumours. ","1016":"In stage IV cancers, locoregional management of primitive tumours as surgery and\/or radiotherapy improved both progression-free survival and overall survival. Among metastatic cancer patients, some of them are considered as oligometastatic stage as they present few metastatic sites associated with low tumor aggressiveness. For those patients, metastatic local control, and therefore prolonged time to progression should be reached through local treatments as surgery and\/or radiofrequency ablation and\/or stereotactic radiotherapy. Here we propose a review of oligometastatic stage and results from extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy in terms of efficacy and tolerance. ","1017":"Extracranial stereotactic radiotherapy is booming. The development and spread of dedicated accelerators coupled with efficient methods of repositioning can now allow treatments of mobile lesions with moderate size, with high doses per fraction. Intuitively, except for the prostate, pelvic tumours, often requiring irradiation of regional lymph node drainage, lend little to this type of treatment. However, in some difficult circumstances, such as boost or re-radiation, stereotactic irradiation condition is promising and clinical experiences have already been reported.

Comparable overall survival rates in operable patients are also supported by non-randomized single-institution and population based studies. Stereotactic radiotherapy has emerged as an alternative, effective and well tolerated in treating pulmonary oligometastases. The early detection of recurrence is important in the medically operable population for whom curative surgical salvage treatments are still available. A standardized definition of recurrence criteria becomes especially important in that context. In 2012, Huang et al. proposed a follow-up algorithm for these patients, whose different points are discussed in this publication.","1021":"In the curative radiotherapy of localized prostate cancer, improvements in biochemical control observed with dose escalation have been counterbalanced by an increase in radiation-induced toxicity. The injection of biodegradable spacers between prostate and rectum represents a new frontier in the optimization of radiotherapy treatments for patients with localized disease. Transperineal injection of different types of spacers under transrectal ultrasound guidance allows creating a 7-to-20 mm additional space between the prostate and the anterior rectal wall lasting 3 to 12 months. Dosimetrically, a relative reduction in the rectal volume receiving at least 70 Gy (V70) in the order of 43% to 84% is observed with all types of spacers, regardless of the radiotherapy technique used. Preliminary clinical results show for all spacers a good tolerance and a possible reduction in the acute side effects rate. The aim of the present systematic review of the literature is to report on indications as well as dosimetric and clinical advantages of the different types of prostate-rectum spacers commercially available (hydrogel, hyaluronic acid, collagen, biodegradable balloon).","1022":"To describe long-term outcome after combined-modality treatment including radiation therapy in patients with localized sarcoma within irradiated field. Individual clinical data from all consecutive patients diagnosed and treated for a localized sarcoma within irradiated field between January 2000 and October 2011 at the Institut Claudius-Regaud, Toulouse, France, were retrospectively reviewed. Twenty-seven patients were eligible for this study. Ten patients were re-irradiated with a rate of unresectable, gross or microscopically positive margins disease significantly higher than the rest of the cohort (90% vs. 12%; P&lt;0.001). After a median follow-up of 3.8 years, there is a non-significant trend toward longer 4-year relapse free survival in the subgroup of patients who received adjuvant or definitive radiation therapy compared to the rest of the cohort (53% vs. 27%; P=0.09) with an acceptable toxicity profile allowing conservative management. The complete surgical resection sarcoma within irradiated field is often difficult to achieve enhancing the risk of relapse. Radiation therapy should be discussed when faced with an unresectable tumour or after suboptimal surgery as part of intensified local management with a curative intent. ","1023":"The incidence of brain metastases from breast cancer is increasing with diagnosis and therapeutics progress, especially with systemic therapies. The occurrence of multiple brain metastases remains a delicate situation when surgery and stereotactic radiosurgery are not indicated, nor available. Treatment strategy is based on the patient's general condition and extracranial disease status. Whole brain radiation therapy remains the gold standard local treatment but its efficacy is limited with a median overall survival of 6 months. New strategies are needed for increasing survival and patients' quality of life. Combining radiation therapy and chemotherapy has been a subject of interest. This article sums up the different radiotherapy plus concomitant systemic therapies combinations for the treatment of brain metastases from breast cancer.","1024":"Rhinopharyngeal cancer is one of the best indications for conformal radiotherapy with modulated intensity. Due to the high dose gradient, accurate delineation of target volumes and organs at risk is a critical success factor with this technology. This requires a good knowledge of rhinopharyngeal radioanatomy and optimal imaging techniques.

Typical and atypical forms are described according to various histologic and histopathologic parameters. Central neurocytoma develops in the periventricular areas and is revealed by increased intracranial pressure. The tumour exhibits typical characteristics on CT scan and MRI and a characteristic peak of glycine on spectroscopy-MRI. The main treatment is total resection, which is achievable only in half of the cases. External beam therapy improves local control of partially resected and\/or atypical central neurocytoma. Many studies show that stereotactic radiotherapy can be used in the therapeutic management as exclusive treatment, in postoperatives residues and in case of distant recurrence.

Their median survival is approximately 18 months. The treatment consists of surgery when possible. The role of chemotherapy and radiation therapy is controversial, especially with respect to limiting cardiac radiation dose that is theoretically incompatible with the requirement of a tumoricidal dose for sarcoma. A recent series of 124 cases of the French Sarcoma Group suggested a benefit of radiation therapy on progression-free survival. The dosimetric data of 12 patients were analyzed. There was variety in radiotherapy modalities and definition of target volumes, doses and techniques are evolving more conformal plans. Irradiation appeared feasible with conventional fractionation with respect to toxicities (although probably underestimated due to short follow-up and dismal prognosis) and previously demonstrated benefit of radiotherapy for primitive cardiac sarcomas. A scheme of 45Gy in 1.8Gy per fraction to a preoperative volume with an additional dose of 14Gy in 7 fractions on areas at risk or residual disease and margins 1cm, may be proposed based on the preliminary data of this study. Intensity modulated radiotherapy with daily cone-beam CT-scanner should be evaluated.

So far, there is no consensus regarding its optimal management. We hereby report on our 10-year single institutional experience in breast ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion including pathological reviewing. All consecutive patients treated for a ductal carcinoma in situ with microinvasion at the Institut Claudius-Regaud (Toulouse, France) over a 10-year period were included in this study. We reviewed all available histological materials. Sixty-three patients were eligible for this study. Two patients presented with a lymph node invasion at diagnosis. Each patient benefited from initial surgical management, which consisted either in mastectomy (n=25) or conservative resection (n=37). Axillary exploration was performed in 52 patients (82%). After a median follow-up of 61.3 months [46.9;69], the 5-year overall survival and disease free survival were 98.2 (95% CI=[88.2;99.7]) and 89.5% (95% CI=[76.3;95.6]) respectively. Two delayed invasive relapses occurred leading to one specific death. The pathological review highlighted a trend towards a loss of HR and HER2 expression (9%) in the microinvasive component in comparison with its surrounded in situ carcinoma. The risk of initial lymph node involvement and delayed invasive local relapse deserve an optimal locoregional management including lymph node evaluation. The non-negligible discrepancy's rate between in situ and microinvasive components justifies HR status and HER2 expression assessment on the microinvasive component.

All patients had pelvic radiotherapy with a median dose of 55Gy in conventional fractionation. Concurrent chemotherapy was administered to 12 patients. A vaginal brachytherapy with a median dose of 20Gy was performed in addition in 3 patients. The median follow-up was 39months. Safety of radiation therapy was correct with 29% of grade 3 acute or intestinal toxicity. Tumor control was observed in 10 patients (71%). Four patients presented a locoregional tumor progression. At the time of analysis, three patients had died from their cancer. From the date of relapse, the rate of overall survival at 2 and 5year was respectively 84% and 74%. Three patients (21%) had severe late effects. In our experience, chemoradiotherapy can achieve a high rate of remission in patients with isolated pelvic recurrence of cervical cancer.

Two different cases of soft-tissues sarcomas were chosen: a case of postoperative and a case of preoperative radiation therapy. Participating centres were requested to delineate clinical target volumes according to their experience in both cases. Descriptive statistic was calculated for each variable (volume, diameters) separately for two cases. Box-whiskers plots were used for presentation of clinical target volume. A Shapiro-Wilk's test was performed to evaluate the departures from normality distribution for each variable. The comparison between relative variations of diameters was evaluated using the Student's t test. Several variations affecting both volumes and diameters were observed. Main variations were observed in the craniocaudal and laterolateral diameters. Each case showed similar dispersion, indicating a lack of reproducibility in volumes definition.

It is difficult to differentiate local tumour recurrences from radiation induced-changes in case of suspicious contrast enhancement. New advanced MRI techniques (perfusion and spectrometry) and amino acid positron-emission tomography (PET) allow to be more accurate and could avoid a stereotactic biopsy for histological assessment, the only reliable but invasive method. We report the case of a patient who underwent surgery for a single, left frontal brain metastasis of a breast carcinoma, followed by adjuvant stereotactic radiotherapy in the operative bed. Seven months after, she presented a local change in the irradiated area on the perfusion-weighted MRI, for which the differentiation between a local tumour recurrence and radionecrosis was not possible. PET with 2-deoxy-((18)F)-fluoro-D-glucose (FDG) revealed a hypermetabolic lesion. After surgical resection, the histological assessment has mainly recovered radionecrosis with few carcinoma cells. The multimodal MRI has greatly contributed to refine the differential diagnosis between tumour recurrence and radionecrosis, which remains difficult. The FDG PET is helpful, in favour of the diagnosis of local tumour recurrence when a hypermetabolic lesion is found. Others tracers (such as carbon 11 or a fluoride isotope) deserve interest but are not available in all centres. Stereotactic biopsy should be discussed if any doubt remains.

Treatment was decided regarding to the age of the patient, his performance status, stage of the disease, lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and socio-economical conditions of the patient. The therapeutic evaluation was done after chemotherapy and after radiotherapy. There was a clinical, biological and radiological follow-up. The mean age was 59.5 years. The sex-ratio was 3. Bone localizations were clavicula, femur, humerus and mandibula. All patients had stage I large cell B lymphoma. In 3 cases, imaging showed osteolytic lesions with cortical destruction and extension to soft tissues. One patient had a fracture of the humerus. The treatment consisted in chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. Three patients were alive with complete remission after a mean follow-up of 76 months. The treatment of primary bone lymphoma is based on a combination of chemotherapy (with or without anti-CD20) and radiotherapy. The prognosis is excellent when it is localized.

Prospective dosimetric comparison between monoisocentric conformal radiotherapy and intensity-modulated radiation therapy in nine patient files. Using intensity-modulated radiation therapy was shown to improve in each case, at least one conformity, homogeneity, and coverage index either for planning target volumes or for organs at risk. Intensity-modulated radiation therapy was therefore always chosen rather than conformal monoisocentric radiotherapy. Indications to retain intensity-modulated radiation therapy would consist of bilateral lesions, pectus excavatum, past thoracic irradiation (Hodgkin's disease) and complex volumes in obese or overweight patients.

Irradiation seems to be a factor inducing an autoimmune process. Clinicians should be aware in case of an erythema in a treated area, appearing on average one year after the end of the irradiation. Histology alone can prove the diagnosis and rule out differential diagnoses: principally mastitis (carcinomatous, infectious), chronic radiodermatitis or radiation recall. Treatment of this rare complication is not consensual; it is most often topical steroids. The evolution is marked by a gradual decrease from the initial inflammation. Sclerosis persists, more or less substantially. ","1051":"Squamous cell carcinoma of larynx with subglottic extension is a rare location described to carry a poor prognosis. The aim of this study was to analyze outcomes and feasibility of definitive radiotherapy in patients with squamous cell carcinoma. Between 1998 and 2012, 56 patients with squamous cell carcinoma were treated at our institution and included in the analysis. Patients received definitive radiotherapy\/chemoradiotherapy alone (63%) or after induction chemotherapy (37%) at our institute. The 5-year actuarial overall survival, progression-free survival and specific survival were 64% (CI 95%: 48-90), 45% (CI 95%: 28-61), 88% (CI 95%: 78-98), respectively, with median follow-up of 74 months. The 5-year locoregional control was 69% (CI 95%: 56-83) and the 5-year distant control was 95% (CI 95%: 89-100). There was no difference in overall survival and locoregional control according to front-line treatments or between primary subglottic cancer and glotto-supraglottic cancers with subglottic extension. In the multivariate analysis, performance status of at least 1 and positive N stage were the only predictors for overall survival (hazard ratio [HR] [CI 95%]: 6.5 [1.3-34; P=0.03] and 11 [1.6-75; P=0.02], respectively). No difference of locoregional control was observed according to the first received therapy. The univariate analysis retrieved that T3-T4 patients had a lower locoregional control (HR: 3.1; CI 95%: 1.1-9.2, P=0.04), but no prognostic factor was retrieved in the multivariate analysis. In patients receiving a larynx preservation protocol, 5-year larynx preservation rate was 88% (CI 95%: 78-98), and 58% in T3 patients. The 5-year larynx preservation rate was 91% (CI 95%: 79-100) and 83% (CI 95%: 66-100) for patients who received radiotherapy\/chemoradiotherapy or induction chemotherapy as a front-line treatment, respectively. This analysis suggests that the results for squamous cell carcinoma patients treated with radiotherapy\/chemoradiotherapy are comparable to those obtained for other laryngeal tumors.

Overall survival rates at 5 years in children and adults were 66 % and 64 %, respectively (P=0.17), disease-free survival rates at 5 years were 66 % and 57 %, respectively (P=0.17). Local failures occurred more frequently in adults than in children (1.4 % versus 14 %). However, metastatic events were frequently seen in children. Late toxicities were important in children, xerostomia was the most common one.

The primary outcome was overall survival; secondary outcomes were event-free survival and cumulative incidences of toxicity. Three randomized controlled trials, with 1263 participants in total, were analyzed. Median follow-up was 11 years. Patients receiving chemotherapy followed by involved field radiotherapy had a significant benefit on event-free survival (hazards ratio [HR]=1.47, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.14 to 1.90; P=0.003), but not improved overall survival (HR=1.00, 95% CI: 0.80 to 1.25; P=0.978) at 8 years, in relation to those in the chemotherapy alone arm.

CT, MRI, DWI-based tumour size correlated well with pathologic sizes, r=0.974, 0.969, 0.964 respectively. But Wilcoxon signed-ranked test showed that differences did exist. CT overestimated the tumour size by 2.9mm compared to pathology (95% CI: -13.2 to 7.4mm). The agreement of MRI-pathology seemed to be worse than CT, with a mean difference of 3.6mm (95% CI: -14.7 to 7.7mm). The worst agreement was in DWI-pathology, with a mean difference of 5mm (95% CI: -17.9 to 7.9mm). But significant difference was found neither between CT and MRI (P=0.477) nor between MRI and DWI (P=0.079). CT and MRI-based tumour size correlated well with pathologic size, but differences did exist. Most of the lesions were overestimated by CT and MRI. CT and MRI were similar in the guidance of target delineation, and DWI had added little value to MRI. A margin of 10mm around the gross tumour volume to become the clinical target volume is likely not sufficient. ","1059":"Radon exposure is a major environmental risk in health. It remains badly known by the general population. It is the second cause of lung cancer, after tobacco smoking. The aim of this cross-sectional general population survey was to describe radon exposure risk knowledge and the socioeconomic factors related to this knowledge. The Cancer Barometer survey 2010 questioned the French population about its knowledge of radon as such and as health risk factor. This survey was a two-stage random sampling with computer-assisted telephone interview that was performed from April 3, 2010 to August 7, 2010 on a sample of 3,359 people aged 15 to 75 years old. Among people aged 15 to 75 years old, only one in five knows that radon is a natural gas coming from the ground. This knowledge is more frequent among people living in an area that is directly concerned by radon, among men and increases with age, with the level of education and the level of income. Radon risk remains still widely underestimated by the general public, including in areas concerned by this risk. When people were confronted with radon exposure, few intended to remedy by improving their home.

A logistic model was performed in order to assess clinical or therapeutic risk factors for required artificial nutrition during treatment. Significant parameters, issued from multivariate analysis, were summed and weighted in a score aiming at estimating a malnutrition risk during radiotherapy. Among the 127 evaluated patients, 59 patients required artificial nutrition during radiotherapy. In multivariate analysis, predictive factors for malnutrition were weight loss superior to 5% in the 3 months before radiotherapy, advanced tumor stage (III-IV vs. I-II), and pain requiring strong analgesics (step II-III vs. I). Concurrent chemotherapy was identified as a significant risk factor also, but it was strongly correlated with the tumor stage. The score, estimated from these previous factors, allowed a prediction of a risk of enteral feeding with a sensitivity of 90% and a specificity of 85%. A predictive score of enteral nutrition before radiotherapy of head and neck cancer should be a useful clinical tool to target the patients who would need a prophylactic gastrostomy.

The tumour size was 14cm in its major axis with the presence of not systematized scattered mitoses, PS 100 was positive at 100% and Ki 67 to 20%. Because of malignant and economic excision of the neoplasm, the patient received adjuvant radiotherapy. After 20 months, the patient had a local recurrence and lung metastasis, supporting the diagnosis of malignancy. She received two chemotherapy regimens of 5-fluoro-uracil\/cisplatin and pacliatxel\/carboplatin without any response.

Intrafraction displacement data, obtained by imaging after each new table position, were evaluated. There were 269 radiosurgery treatments performed on 190 patients and a total of 967 setups within different angles. The first measured error after each table rotation (mean 2.6) was evaluated (698 measurements). Intrafraction translational errors were (1 standard deviation [SD]) on average 0.8, 0.8, and 0.7mm for the left-right, superior-inferior, and anterior-posterior directions, respectively, with a mean 3D-vector of 1.0mm (SD 0.9mm) and a range from -5mm to +5mm. On average, 12%, 3%, and 1% of the translational deviations exceeded 1, 2, and 3mm, respectively, in the three directions. The range of intrafraction patient motion in frameless image-guided stereotactic radiosurgery is often not fully mapped by pre- and post-treatment imaging. In the current study, intrafraction motion was assessed by performing measurements at several time points during the course of stereotactic radiosurgery.

The aim of this review was to assess diagnostic and therapeutic approaches and criteria that may be used for a customized selective approach to avoid severe toxicities of pan-mucosal irradiation. A literature search was performed with the following keywords: cervical lymphadenopathy, unknown primary, upper aerodigestive tract, cancer, radiotherapy, squamous cell carcinoma, variants. The diagnostic workup includes a head and neck scanner or MRI, ((18)F)-FDG PET CT, a panendoscopy and tonsillectomy. Squamous cell carcinoma represents over two thirds of cases. The number of metastatic cervical nodes, nodal level, and histological variant (associated with HPV\/EBV status) may determine the primary site origin and might be weighted for the determination of radiation target volumes on a multidisciplinary basis. A selective customized approach is relevant to decrease radiation toxicity only if neck and mucosal control is not impaired. Although no recommendation can yet be made in the absence of sufficient level of evidence, the relevance of systematic pan-mucosal irradiation appears questionable in a number of clinical situations. Accordingly, a customized selective redefinition of target volumes may be discussed and be prospectively evaluated in relation to the therapeutic index obtained.

A better understanding of microscopic invasion by tumour cells, based on histological analysis of surgical specimens and analysis of recurrence sites, has justified a reduction in radiotherapy target volumes. The delineation of the clinical target volume (CTV) depends on tumour characteristics (site, histology) and on its spread as assessed on endoscopic ultrasonography and ((18)F)-fluorodeoxyglucose positron-emission tomography (FDG-PET). We propose that positive and negative predictive values for FDG-PET should be used to adapt the CTV according to the risk of nodal involvement. ","1074":"Radiotherapy is a major modality in the treatment of brain tumours. The target volumes definition has to be precise for the radiation planification. The gross target volume (GTV) is most of the time delineated within the fusion of the planning CT scan with the appropriated MRI sequences. The clinical target volume (CTV) definition is more complex: it varies in time following the evolution of scientific knowledge and also depending of the school of thought. This article offers a review of the literature about the margins applied in brain tumours radiotherapy for gliomas (high grade, anaplastic, low grade and brain stem gliomas), embryologic tumours (medulloblastomas and primitive neuroectodermal tumours [PNET]), ependymomas, atypical teratoid rahbdoid tumours (ATRT), craniopharyngiomas, pineal gland tumours, primary central nervous cell lymphomas, meningiomas and schwannomas. New imaging modalities such as diffusion-weighted imaging, dynamic contrast enhanced, spectroscopic MRI and PET scan will allow us to delineate more precisely the target volumes and to realise dose-painting by adapting the dose to the tumour metabolism. ","1075":"Preoperative radiochemotherapy followed by total mesorectal excision is the standard of care for T3-T4-N0 or TxN1 rectal cancer. Defining target volumes relies on the patterns of nodal and locoregional failures. The lower limit of the clinical target volume depends also on the type of surgery. Conformational radiotherapy with or without intensity-modulated radiotherapy implies an accurate definition of volumes and inherent margins in the context of mobile organs such as the upper rectum. Tumoral staging recently improved with newer imaging techniques such as MRI with or without USPIO and FDG-PET-CT. The role of PET-CT remains unclear despite encouraging results and MRI is a helpful tool for a reliable delineation of the gross tumour volume. Co-registration of such modalities with the planning CT may particularly guide radiation oncologists through the gross tumour volume delineation. Acute digestive toxicity can be reduced with intensity modulation radiation therapy. Different guidelines and CT-based atlas regarding the target volumes in rectal cancer give the radiation oncologist a lot of ground for reproducible contours. ","1076":"Chemotherapy is a part of the combined multimodality treatment for locally advanced head and neck cancers. Concomitant administration with radiation therapy is the standard treatment for these patients. The efficacy of the docetaxel-cisplatinum-5-fluoro-uracil (TPF) regimen compared to the platinum-5-fluoro-uracil (PF) regimen raised the question of whether this treatment could improve the therapeutic results for locally advanced tumours. For larynx preservation, induction chemotherapy using TPF, followed by radiation therapy for good responders is a valid option. However, clinical studies have to be performed to compare this approach to the concomitant radiation therapy-chemotherapy approach using functional endpoints. For locally advanced tumors, despite the superiority of the TPF regimen over the PF, there is no evidence in the literature to support the use of induction chemotherapy prior to concomitant radiation therapy-chemotherapy. Two recent studies (DECIDE, PARADIGM) failed to demonstrate any benefit, but both trials were stopped early because of slow enrollment. Other studies are on going, or with recently finished accrual, will help to shed light on the role of this treatment. ","1077":"The various image-guided radiotherapy techniques raise the question of how to achieve the control of patient positioning before irradiation session and sharing of tasks between radiation oncologists and radiotherapy technicians. We have put in place procedures and operating methods to make a partial delegation of tasks to radiotherapy technicians and secure the process in three situations: control by orthogonal kV imaging (kV-kV) of bony landmarks, control by kV-kV imaging of intraprostatic fiducial goldmarkers and control by cone beam CT (CBCT) imaging for prostate cancer. Significant medical overtime is required to control these three IGRT techniques. Because of their competence in imaging, these daily controls can be delegated to radiotherapy technicians. However, to secure the process, initial training and regular evaluation are essential. The analysis of the comparison of the use of kV\/kV on bone structures allowed us to achieve a partial delegation of control to radiotherapy technicians. Controlling the positioning of the prostate through the use and automatic registration of fiducial goldmarkers allows better tracking of the prostate and can be easily delegated to radiotherapy technicians. The analysis of the use of daily cone beam CT for patients treated with intensity modulated irradiation is underway, and a comparison of practices between radiotherapy technicians and radiation oncologists is ongoing to know if a partial delegation of this control is possible. ","1078":"A national survey was conducted among the radiation oncology residents about their clinical activities and responsibilities. The aim was to evaluate the clinical workload and to assess how medical tasks are delegated and supervised. A first questionnaire was administered to radiation oncology residents during a national course. A second questionnaire was mailed to 59 heads of departments. The response rate was 62% for radiation oncology residents (99 questionnaires) and 51% for heads of department (30). Eighteen heads of department (64%) declared having written specifications describing the residents' clinical tasks and roles, while only 31 radiation oncology residents (34%) knew about such a document (P=0.009). A majority of residents were satisfied with the amount of medical tasks that were delegated to them. Older residents complained about insufficient exposure to new patient's consultation, treatment planning and portal images validation. The variations observed between departments may induce heterogeneous trainings and should be addressed specifically. National specifications are necessary to reduce heterogeneities in training, and to insure that the residents' training covers all the professional skills required to practice radiation oncology. A frame endorsed by academic and professional societies would also clarify the responsibilities of both residents and seniors.

The following presentation details clinical and technical strategies of managing such situations. ","1080":"Hippocampi plays a fundamental role in immediate or long-term memory and the spatial learning. This structure is rarely involved by metastasis and their irradiation is at the origin of some impairment of the neurocognitive function. Sparing hippocampi during whole brain radiation therapy becomes possible with volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT) or with helical tomotherapy. The delineation of the structures should be performed after coregistration of gadolinium-enhanced T1-weighted MR-images with the planning. The D40 to both hippocampi should not be greater than 7.3 Gy. Patients who are more likely to benefit from a hippocampal-sparing strategy must have a 6 months or longer life expectancy and a Karnosky index above 70. Hence, patients who are more likely to be deemed fit for this strategy are frequently patients with NSCLC, breast cancer, gastointestinal cancers or patients. Patients with small cell lung carcinoma who are selected for prophylactic cerebral irradiation should be also considered, as they are unfit for ablative treatments such as stereotactic radiotherapy or brain surgery. Moreover, brain metastasis located in the area surrounding the hippocampi are unlikely. To date, no randomized study is available to confirm these assumptions. Two on-going prospective trials (RTOG 0933 and a French phase II trial) are currently investigating whether breast cancer patients with a single resected metastasis could benefit from the hippocampal-sparing strategy during whole brain radiotherapy.","1081":null,"1082":"The development of accelerators with on-board imaging systems now allows better target volumes reset at the time of irradiation (image-guided radiotherapy [IGRT]).

As there is currently no explicit regulatory framework governing the use of IGRT, some institutional experiments show that a transfer is possible between radiation oncologists and radiotherapy technicians for on-line verification of image positioning. Initial training for every technical and drafting procedures within institutions will improve audit quality by reducing interindividual variability. ","1083":"The lymphatic system of the pelvis collects the lymph of the genital and urinary organs and of the digestive tract. It is formed by lymphatic nodes and vessels situated inside the conjunctive tissue, near the organs (visceral lymphatic nodes) but especially along the external, internal and common iliac vessels (iliac lymphatic nodes). These nodes receive afferent vessels issued from the different pelvic organs. From the iliac lymphnodes arise efferent vessels running towards lymphatic collectors, situated above them, and which end in the lymphatic lombar duct. The lymphatic pathways represent the preferential way of scattering of cancerous cells. Therefore, the knowledge of the anatomy, of the situation and of the draining of the nodes is of the utmost importance in the evaluation of a cancer of a pelvic organ. ","1084":"Brain irradiation can be used for the treatment of cancers in different protocols: focal radiotherapy, whole brain radiotherapy, with or without additive dose on the tumour. Different modalities (conformational, stereotactic radiosurgery) can be used for curative or prophylactic treatment. Brain radiotherapy leads to cognitive deterioration with subcortical profile. This cognitive deterioration can be associated to radiation-induced leukoencephalopathy on brain MRI. Taking into account radiation induced cognitive troubles is becoming more important with the prolonged survival allowed by treatment improvement. Concerning low-grade gliomas, radiation-induced cognitive troubles appear about 6 years after treatment and occur earlier when the fraction dose is important. Primitive cerebral lymphoma treatment can induce cognitive troubles in 25 to 30% surviving patients. These deficits are more frequent in elderly patients, leading to radiotherapy delay in those patients. Patients treated for brain metastasis often have cognitive impairment before radiotherapy (until 66%), this pretreatment impairment is related to global survival. The use of conformational radiation therapy, particularly with hippocampal sparing is conceptually interesting but has not proved its efficiency for cognitive preservation in clinical trials yet. Stereotactic radiation therapy could be an interesting compromise between metastatic tumoral volume reduction and cognitive preservation. Taking care of radiotherapy induced cognitive troubles is a challenge. Before considering its treatment and prevention, we need to elaborate a way of detecting them using a reliable and easy way. CSCT, a computerized test whose execution needs 90 seconds, could be used before treatment and during the clinical follow-up by the patient's oncologist or radiotherapist. If the patient's performance reduces, he can be oriented to a neurologist in order to perform fuller evaluation of its cognitive capacities and be treated if necessary.","1085":"Soft tissue sarcoma is a rare entity and heterogeneous disease and its management therefore requires an experienced multidisciplinary team in an expert center. Standard treatment for grade 2 and 3 sarcomas is a conservative, extended surgery planned according to the results of the biopsy, and radiotherapy usually administered postoperatively (or pre-operatively). The indications for preoperative radiotherapy are discussed in a multidisciplinary meeting for locally advanced tumours. The definition of target volumes for conformal radiation therapy requires a good knowledge of the patient record, radioanatomy, as well as a careful reading of surgical and histological reports. The definitions of target volumes combine anatomical and geometrical approach. The gross tumour volume is the visible tumour on MRI preoperatively. The corresponding clinical target volume is defined by a larger longitudinal automatic extension than the radial extension. It is manually corrected taking into account the anatomical barriers to tumour spread. The planning target volume is a concentric automatic margin that may vary from one institution to another, depending on the immobilisation devices and verification of repositioning. Innovative radiotherapy techniques may be used to reduce the size of the margins around target volumes and better protect the organs at risk.","1086":"The impact of curative radiotherapy depends mainly on the total dose delivered homogenously in the targeted volume. Nevertheless, the dose delivered to the surrounding healthy tissues may reduce the therapeutic ratio of many radiation treatments. In a same population treated in one center with the same technique, it appears that individual radiosensitivity clearly exists, namely in terms of late side effects that are in principle non-reversible. This review details the different radiobiological approaches that have been developed to better understand the mechanisms of radiation-induced late effects.

This overview of the literature describes recent development in this field, aiming to improve local control while the sparing of organ at risk remains an important goal. Radiation therapy is currently implementing major new technologies set to improve external beam irradiation with new concepts on dose, fractionation, intensity modulated radiation therapy and stereotactic approach - as well as in brachytherapy. Apart from dedicated studies, the great heterogeneity of the treated patients should be underlined and taken into consideration. However, current data confirm the feasibility of reirradiation with acceptable local control and toxicity. ","1088":"External beam radiotherapy alone is a standard treatment for prostate cancer. According to clinical, histological and biological characteristics of the tumour, lymph node irradiation can be done in combination with irradiation of the prostate. The completion of pelvic irradiation remains controversial and may cause complications by increasing volumes of irradiated healthy tissues.

Regulation in force for some of them (medical physicists, or health professionals such as radiation oncologists and radiotherapists) has not followed the evolution of the organization of radiotherapy units, which had to adapt to miscellaneous constraints. This paper analyzes the tasks' assignments among professionals according to current regulations and practices and suggests some regulation change. Recognizing medical physicists and dosimetrists as health professionals is a natural evolution in the practice of radiation therapy. Arguments in favor of such are being discussed here. A larger autonomy of radiotherapists appears necessary and feasible. Whatever the tasks' assignments in radiotherapy units, it should be formally consigned in the management system documentation.

Even so, brachytherapy allows the delivery of the right dose at the right place by dispensing with target volume motion and repositioning. The evolution of brachytherapy can be based on a road-map including at least the following three points: the acquisition of clinical evidence, teaching and valuation of the procedures. The evolution of brachytherapy will be also impacted by technological considerations (end of the production of low dose rate 192 iridium wires). Regarding the evolution toward a personalized treatment, brachytherapy of the future should take its place as a partner of other modern external beam radiation techniques, be performed by experimented actors (physicians, physicists, technicians, etc.) who received adequate training, and be valued in proportion to the delivered medical service.","1091":"Squamous cell anal cancer is a rare malignancy, its incidence increases due to higher exposure of the young adults to risk factors.

Improvement of radiation technique such as intensity modulated radiation therapy has led to reduce acute toxicities, but also requires an accurate delineation of the target volumes in order not to underestimate potential and pathological sites resulting in an increase of the locoregional failures. PET scanner has an important place in the pretreatment work-up for staging and targeting the delineation of the volumes, allowing to select patients with localized disease, avoid geographic miss and appropriately boost nodal disease. The study of recurrences sites has not yet provided a real mapping of the recurrences depending on the treatment volumes. Different radiation oncologist cooperative groups have published guidelines and tools for delineation, in order to provide homogeneity but also customize the management of anal carcinoma. ","1092":"The aim of this study was to carry out a review of margins that should be used for the delineation of target volumes in lung cancer, with a focus on margins from gross tumour volume (GTV) to clinical target volume (CTV) and internal target volume (ITV) delineation. Our review was based on a PubMed literature search with, as a cornerstone, the 2010 European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) recommandations by De Ruysscher et al. The keywords used for the search were: radiotherapy, lung cancer, clinical target volume, internal target volume. The relevant information was categorized under the following headings: gross tumour volume definition (GTV), CTV-GTV margin (first tumoural CTV then nodal CTV definition), in field versus elective nodal irradiation, metabolic imaging role through the input of the PET scanner for tumour target volume and limitations of PET-CT imaging for nodal target volume definition, postoperative radiotherapy target volume definition, delineation of target volumes after induction chemotherapy; then the internal target volume is specified as well as tumoural mobility for lung cancer and respiratory gating techniques. Finally, a chapter is dedicated to planning target volume definition and another to small cell lung cancer. For each heading, the most relevant and recent clinical trials and publications are mentioned. ","1093":"","1094":"Radiotherapy plays a central role in the management of localized prostate cancer, but the total duration of treatment of nearly 2 months poses not only problems of fatigue related to repetitive transports, especially for older patients, but also increases the overall cost of treatment including linear accelerators occupancy and patient transportation. To address this problem, various teams have developed hypofractionated radiotherapy protocols seeking to maintain the same efficacy and toxicity while reducing the total duration of treatment. These hypofractionated protocols require recent techniques such as image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) and intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT). Single centre series have validated the feasibility of \"light\" hypofractionation schemes at doses per fraction less than 6 Gy Similarly, different teams have shown the possibility of stereotactic irradiation for delivering \"severe\" hypofractionation schemes at doses greater than 6 Gy per fraction. Whatever the dose per fraction, the current clinical data support the conclusion that hypofractionated radiotherapy does not increase mid-term toxicity and could even improve biochemical control. Studies with the objective of demonstrating non-inferiority are expected to definitively validate the role of hypofractionated irradiation in the treatment of prostate cancer.","1095":"Radiotherapy planification has recently known important developments, with the rise of new technologies, such as conformational radiation therapy, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) or stereotaxic radiation therapy. Delineation of target volumes has become primordial. Hybrid imaging by positron emission tomography associated to computed tomography scanner (PET-CT) gives an access to functional and morphological information. Radiotherapist and nuclear physicians working closely have the potential to allow a more optimal delineation, and a better preservation of organs at risk. During the past few years, this has been explored by many articles, and we propose a literature review organized by localization, about the use of PET-CT for pelvic nodes delineation. ","1096":"The planning CT allows the delineation of the prostate (clinical target volume, CTV) but with an imprecision at the apex and the inability to visualize the intraprostatic cancer. MRI enables accurate visualization of the prostate outlines and in some extent the intraprostatic tumour (gross tumour volume [GTV]). The integration of MRI data within the CT remains still complex. Analysis of prostatectomy specimen has guided the definition of a CTV beyond the capsule, depending on pretreatment factors. In practice, the CTV can be defined as follows: prostate-only, for good prognosis tumours; prostate (+0 to 5mm margins, excluding the rectum) and seminal vesicles (possibly limited to 2 cm of their proximal region) for intermediate-risk tumours; prostate (+5mm margins) and seminal vesicles for high-risk tumours. The planning target volume (PTV) should be between 5mm and 10mm depending on the space directions, in the absence of image-guidance (IGRT). It could be reduced to 5mm in case of IGRT. In the adjuvant setting after prostatectomy, the definition of the CTV should follow the recommendations from cooperative groups. It takes into account both the analysis of pattern of local recurrence after prostatectomy, but also the specific histological analysis of the surgical specimen of the patient. The corresponding PTV margin is 6 to 8mm.","1097":"Gynecological cancers are lymphophilic cancers, which require the systematic inclusion of nodal areas in the clinical target volume when irradiation is planned in the therapeutic strategy for these cancers. Radiotherapy with intensity modulation that achieves better saving of healthy tissue is more often used. However, the very steep dose gradients generated by this technique can lead to poorer coverage of target volumes if they are not defined very precisely by taking into account their anatomical location. This is particularly true for lymph node target volumes, so the purpose of this article is to present recommendations from a literature review focused on this issue, in terms of selection and delineation of lymph node in irradiation of cervix and endometrial cancers. ","1098":"The management of patients with brain metastases remains a difficult and controversial subject. For years, the standard treatment has been whole-brain radiation therapy alone, but its validity is now under question because of improvements in surgery and the development of radiosurgery or novel targeted therapies and also because whole-brain radiation therapy is responsible for long term neurocognitive toxicity. Therefore it is important to assess diagnosis-specific prognostic factors and indexes when scheduling treatments. The GPA score (Graded Prognostic Assessment), established for various histologic tumor types, includes five prognostic factors: age, Karnofsky Performance Status, presence of extracranial metastases, number of brain metastases and also genetic subtype for breast cancer. We propose an adaptation of the management of brain metastases according to the GPA score. ","1099":"The aim of this article is to present the determination and the delineation of target volumes for oral cavity and oropharyngeal carcinomas treated with intensity-modulated irradiation. The delineation on the computerized tomography scanner (CT scan) requires a precise method because of the complexity of the head-and-neck anatomy. Different elements are necessary: clinical examination, diagram of the initial tumor, surgical and pathological reports and medical imaging (CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography). The clinical target volumes, the planning target volumes, the organs at risk and the planning organs at risk volumes are discussed. The concept of selectivity of the potential subclinical disease near the primary tumour and the selection of neck nodal targets are specified according to the literature.

This work reports the experience of Paul-Strauss Center over a 4-year period on 15 children and covering 386 general anesthesia. The rate of anesthesia-related complications was low (0.5%) subject to the experience of the anesthesiologists and follow-up recommendations. ","1101":"Onboard volumetric imaging systems can provide accurate data of the patient's anatomy during a course of head and neck radiotherapy making it possible to assess the actual delivered dose and to evaluate the dosimetric impact of complex daily positioning variations and gradual anatomic changes such as geometric variations of tumors and normal tissues or shrinkage of external contours. Adaptive radiotherapy is defined as the correction of a patient's treatment planning to adapt for individual variations observed during treatment. Strategies are developed to selectively identify patients that require replanning because of an intolerable dosimetric drift. Automated tools are designed to limit time consumption. Deformable image registration algorithms are the cornerstones of these strategies, but a better understanding of their limits of validity is required before adaptive radiotherapy can be safely introduced to daily practice. Moreover, strict evaluation of the clinical benefits is yet to be proven. ","1102":"Concurrent chemoradiation followed by brachytherapy is currently the standard treatment for locally advanced cervix carcinomas. Modern radiation techniques require planning based on 3D images, and therefore an accurate delineation of target volumes. The clinical target volume (CTV) used for the different phases of treatment are now well defined, but are not always easy to delineate on a CT scan which is currently the standard examination for simulation in radiotherapy. MRI and PET-CT are routinely performed at diagnosis, and can be used to improve the accuracy of the delineation. The objective of this review is to describe the definitions and recommendations of CTV in the treatment of cervical cancer. ","1103":null,"1104":"Radical cystectomy is the gold standard treatment of invasive bladder carcinoma, but conservative treatment is a serious option for selected patients. It comprises a transurethral resection, as complete as possible, before a radiation therapy of the whole bladder and pelvis, with a concomitant chemotherapy. Bladder wall movements during the treatment course lead to the use of wide margins to cover the clinical target volume. Planning target volume margins must be anisotropic to correspond to the mobility of each bladder zone: 10mm in the inferior portion, 15 mm in lateral directions, and 20 to 25 mm in anterior and superior directions. The development of image-guided radiotherapy and adaptative radiotherapy should lead to a reduction of these margins. Besides, partial bladder radiotherapy is showing encouraging results, by reducing the clinical target volume in well-selected patients.","1105":"Hypofractionation is not a new idea in radiotherapy. The use of a few high-dose fractions has been proposed by some pioneers of our specialty in the early years of the 20th century. Hypofractionation then reappeared several times in the next decades, based on successive radiobiological concepts, a number of them having been shown to be wrong. The nominal single dose (NSD), for example, so fashionable in the 1970's, dramatically underestimated the late toxicity of the high-dose fractions. Consequently, the NSD was directly responsible for a significant increase of the incidence and of the severity of late complications in large cohorts of patients. The linear-quadratic model (LQ) unequivocally improved our understanding of fractionation sensitivity, but one has to keep in mind its limitations, both in the areas of low and high doses per fraction. For more than a decade, prostate cancer has been the subject of fierce discussions about its sensitivity to fractionation. A number of studies have suggested an unusually low (for a malignant tumor) alpha\/beta ratio. However, the available data do not allow a precise evaluation of this ratio; \"very low\" (1.5 Gy), with an advantage of hypofractionation in terms of local control? Or simply \"low\" (3-4 Gy), only allowing a reduction of the total number of fractions (with a dose adequately reduced)? While waiting for complementary data, it is advised to remain very careful when modifying the classical schemes towards hypofractionation. ","1106":"The planning of irradiation treatments is a task of medical physics, based on the appropriate calculations of a dose distribution from radiation beams, virtually set up on a simulation software. This task is at the centre of the chain of treatment preparation: between the contouring phase and the objective definition, which are specialties of the radiation oncologist, and the joint validation of the treatment plan by the physician and the physicist. Historically, this task has been performed by the medical physicist, but can be delegated to other professionals, especially radiation technologists. The evolution of the techniques and procedures tends to a specialization of the skilled workers toward this new work of dosimetry specialist or treatment planning technician. In this paper, the training, relational and organizational aspects will be described to explain how the delegation of the tasks, in the context of treatment plan preparation between professionals can be set up with the highest level of quality and security for the patient treatment and with the respect of legal obligations and requirements of each profession. ","1107":"The number of obese patients has increased in France over the last two decades, which has had an impact on the incidence of numerous types of cancer. The treatment of cancer by radiotherapy is impacted by obesity as a result of the physical, technical and dosimetric constraints, the acute and late toxicity, local control and the survival of patients. ","1108":"Detecting metastatic pelvic lymph nodes is essential during the survey of a pelvic carcinoma. In routine clinical practice, CT scan is commonly used. However, its accuracy is quite low for small size lymph nodes. Diffusion-weighted imaging could be in the near future an efficient modality. ","1109":"For head and neck cancer, intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) provides benefits in terms of coverage of the target tumour volume and reduction of the dose to organs at risk. Altered fractionation called SMART (simultaneous modulated accelerated radiation therapy) or SIB (simultaneous integrated boost), equivalent to the \"concomitant boost\" of conventional techniques, provides additional theoretical gain in the therapeutic index and simplifies the practical implementation of the treatment. The impact on tumour control and acute and late toxicities is encouraging but needs to be confirmed by prospective clinical studies with sufficient follow-up. A lot of different protocols have been tested without really bringing out a \"gold standard\". However, the current results tend to suggest a SIB\/SMART-IMRT moderately accelerated without combined chemotherapy for limited stages (I and II), and SIB-IMRT slightly accelerated with induction and\/or concomitant chemotherapy for more advanced stages (III and IV). ","1110":"The goal of this article is to propose some practical means of pain management in radiation departments. Pain management in radiation oncology is difficult because of the high proportion of painful patients, underestimation by medical teams, and limited therapeutic options. Pain can cause mobilization difficulties, set-up errors, treatment interruption. According to procedure steps, a preventive attitude (for pre-radiation consultation) or an active attitude (for treatment) to quickly relieve the patient can be planned. This work is a brain storming about pain management. It is not a review about analgesic radiotherapy. The practical situations apply to patients to whom radiotherapy is indicated. Teamwork and anticipation are keywords to relieve patients. All proposed means are not always available for different reasons (time, finance, staff, training). The idea is to establish simple procedures that are appropriate to each center to fluidify acts, to optimize time for a successful irradiation. ","1111":"The causes of agitation in adult patients are numerous. Agitation may cause difficulty or impossibility to initiate the radiotherapy technique but also can lead to accidents harmful to patients. However, the decision to not irradiate agitated patients may lead to a loss of curability chance or chance to palliate symptoms. Before taking such a decision, thinking about the possibilities available to calm the patient should be undertaken with the patient and the referring practitioners to attempt to make this therapy if it is considered major in the management of cancer. In all cases, current adaptations of radiotherapy should be used to deliver an effective radiation of a suitable time and safely.

By analogy with industrial processes, a technical decision form the French Nuclear Safety Authority in 2008 requires radiotherapy professionals to conduct analyzes of risks to patients. The process of risk analysis had been tested in three pilot centers, before the occurrence of accidents, with the creation of cells feedback. The regulation now requires all radiotherapy services to have similar structures to collect precursor events, incidents and accidents, to perform analyzes following rigorous methods and to initiate corrective actions. At the same time, it is also required to conduct analyzes a priori, less intuitive, and usually require the help of a quality engineer, with the aim of reducing risk.

Patients with residual disease in clinical or radiographic examinations (CT or MRI scans) up to 3 months after completion of radiochemotherapy profit from neck dissections. In patients with an initial or delayed clinical complete remission after completion of radiochemotherapy, a neck dissection can be safely omitted.

At the time of ((18)F)-fluorocholine PET, median prostate specific antigen (PSA) was 3.0 ng\/mL (from 0.34 to 93 ng\/mL) and 17 patients (60.7%) received hormone therapy. Eighteen patients from this cohort were potentially candidates to salvage radiotherapy. A pathologic uptake was shown in 11 patients (39.3%) and 17 patients (60.7%) had no pathologic uptake. Median PSA was 2.4 ng\/mL (0.33 to 36 ng\/mL) in case of negative ((18)F)-fluorocholine PET, versus 6.75 ng\/mL (1.21 to 93 ng\/mL) in case of pathologic uptake (P=0.04).

Techniques, brachytherapy modalities (low dose-rate, high dose-rate, pulsed dose-rate), doses and indications vary according to centres. Brachytherapy advantages are in relation with ballistic properties, allowing a very high dose to the target with normal tissue sparing.

Radiotherapy is considered a standard treatment option after surgery and adjuvant endocrine therapy is also universally used. Tamoxifen and letrozole are the current first-line endocrine therapy drugs. However, information has been scarce about how best to sequence these therapies to maximize their effectiveness and keep toxic effects to a minimum. In this study, we observed the effect of different sequence combination of radiotherapy and endocrine drugs, tamoxifen or letrozole, to get the best treatment sequence. The combination effect of radiotherapy and tamoxifen was observed on breast tumour cell line MCF-7, radiotherapy and letrozole on aromatase-expressing breast tumour cell line MCF-7CA. Irradiation was performed with 6Gy, except for doses ranging from 0 to 8Gy for clone formation assay. Tamoxifen or letrozole was added before or after irradiation, respectively. Radiosensitivity was evaluated by clonogenic assay, cell viability by 3-(4,-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxyphenyl)-2-(4-sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium, inner salt (MTS) assay. To explore the potential mechanism, cell apoptosis was determined by DNA-binding dye 4',6-diamidino-2-phenylindole dihydrochloride (DAPI) assay, the change of Bcl-2 and Bax expression was by western blot. Although no significant statistical difference was observed between different sequence, tamoxifen and letrozole both increased radiosensitivity.

Radiation therapy was delivered according two schemes: 25Gy in five fractions (short scheme) or 45 to 50Gy with a classical fractionation (long scheme). Long scheme patients received a concomitant chemotherapy with 5-fluoro-uracile alone or associated with oxaliplatin. The three groups were comparable for performance status, Charlson's score and T staging.

All patients treated with the short scheme irradiation received the treatment without any acute toxicity. In the long scheme group, 65% of patients received the treatment on time and grade 3 or above toxicity was observed in 12% of patients who did not receive oxaliplatin and in 48% of patients who received oxaliplatin. The overall survival rate at 3 and 5 years was 66.9% and 60.8% in the group 1, 90.5% and 75.9% in the group 2 and 80.5% and 73.8% in the group 3 (P=0.15). Neoadjuvant treatment is feasible with encouraging survival rates for patients aged 70 years and older. Short scheme radiation therapy seems to be an interesting option in this population. ","1131":"The main indication of oesophageal brachytherapy is palliative: it can improve dysphagia in patients with a tumor not suitable for surgery or chemoradiotherapy. A randomized clinical trial showed that survival without dysphagia and quality of life was improved by endoluminal brachytherapy in comparison to self-expansible metallic stents. It also increases the duration of palliation after laser deobstruction. Its role as a curative treatment of locally advanced tumors is still discussed: in combination with external beam radiotherapy, it seems that brachytherapy increased the rate of severe toxicity (haemorrhages, fistula, stenosis). In superficial lesions, brachytherapy with or without external beam radiotherapy seems logical but large prospective studies are missing in this setting.","1132":"Economic data in the literature for brachytherapy are still sparse and heterogeneous, with few controlled prospective studies and a perspective most often limited to those of the provider (health insurances). Moreover, these observation and conclusions are difficult to generalize in France. The prospective health economic studies performed in France in the framework of a national program to sustain innovative and costly therapies (STIC program) launched by the French cancer national institute are therefore of most importance. With the exception of prostate brachytherapy with permanent seeds, the valorisation of the brachytherapy activity by the French national health insurance does not take into account the degree of complexity and the real costs supported by health institutions (i.e. no specific valorisation for 3D image-based treatment planning and dose optimization and for the use of pulsed dose rate brachytherapy).","1133":"Deep modifications have occurred these last years in the brachytherapy use in patients with cervix cancer. Imaging allowed a more precise definition of the volumes of interest linked to the tumour and its extension as well as a better visualization of organs at risk. Recommendations on delineation modalities were published in 2005, leading to definition homogeneity, even if large variations are still observed among centres, in terms of techniques and doses. These new definitions also served as basis for new applicators development, allowing a combination of interstitial and endocavitary techniques. Results from centres using image-guided brachytherapy (MRI in particular) evidenced local control improvement, without increase in complications. Retrospective and prospective studies are currently under evaluation. These studies will likely be able to determine dose required to sterilize tumours, as a function of stage and size, as well as dose limits for organs at risk.","1134":"During the last decade, the organization of brachytherapy in France moved to 62 units in 173 radiotherapy centres in 2009.

Finally, the principal avenues of development will be discussed.","1137":"Low-dose rate brachytherapy has some radiobiological advantages compared to external beam radiotherapy: subletal damages repair during irradiation leading to a relative protection of healthy tissues; no tumor cell repopulation, cell cycle redistribution and a low oxygen enhancement ratio. High dose rate and pulsed dose rate modalities allow an optimization of dose distribution by varying the dwell times over the different dwell positions. Because of the use of afterloaders, they also offer a better radioprotection of the staff. High dose rate and pulsed dose rate treatments seem to offer the same results as low-dose rate brachytherapy, particularly in cervix carcinoma. For high dose rate brachytherapy, schedules must be designed according to the linear-quadratic model. In pulsed dose rate brachytherapy, pulse dose and time intervals must also be derived from the linear-quadratic model, but half-time repair must be taken into account.","1138":"Ductal carcinoma in situ overall prognosis is excellent, but after breast conserving surgery, with or without radiotherapy, local recurrences can lead to locoregional or distant evolution and death.

Eighty-two out of 195 (42%) local recurrences were non-invasive (in situ) and 113 (58%) invasive. In situ local recurrence was discovered by mammography in 80.5% of the cases versus 47.5% for invasive local recurrence (P=0.0001). Salvage mastectomy was used in 53% of the cases after conservative surgery and 75% after conservative surgery followed by radiotherapy. The axillary nodal involvement rates were 11.8% and 25.8% among 17 and 62 patients with in situ and invasive local recurrences. Among 113 patients with invasive local recurrences and 82 with in situ local recurrences, 19 (16.8%) and three (3.6%) developed metastases, respectively. Among invasive local recurrences, comedocarcinoma subtype was highly predictive of subsequent metastases (32% versus 4.4%, P&lt;0.0007). Invasive local recurrence after ductal carcinoma in situ treatment could be a dramatic event, fully changing long-term prognosis. Early mammographic local recurrence diagnosis (if possible still at non-invasive stage) seems essential to avoid or minimize metastatic risk. Mastectomy remains the safest option but, in some cases, a new conservative approach could be discussed. ","1139":"Cutaneous basal or squamous cell carcinomas are frequent lesions, their prognosis being associated to local control. Surgery remains the standard of treatment, if a complete resection can be realized without impairment of cosmesis or function. Brachytherapy can be used in the other cases, and is especially well adapted to periorificial lesions of the face. It is mostly realized with low dose rate iridium wires, but can be done with high dose rate if outpatient treatment is preferred. It allows high local control rates with very few late complications. The indication has to be discussed as first line treatment, according to the patient's age and general condition, the characteristics of the lesion, and the risk of late cosmetic or functional side-effects of the different therapeutic options.","1140":null,"1141":null,"1142":"Prospective monocentric study of the toxicities related to concurrent administration of trastuzumab to breast radiotherapy. One hundred and seventy-three patients were treated between June 2003 and March 2009 by concurrent trastuzumab with normofractionated radiotherapy. Trastuzumab was delivered every 3 weeks (8mg\/kg in the first infusion then 6mg\/kg) during a median time of 12 months (2-62). Left ventricular ejection fraction was assessed by echocardiography or cardiac scintigraphy at baseline, before and after radiotherapy, every 3 months for 1 year and annually. A left ventricular ejection fraction strictly lower than 55% was considered as altered. All toxicities were evaluated using Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Effects version 3.0. Median follow-up was 52 months (17-88). Median age was 52 years (25-83). One hundred and thirty-four patients (77.5%) received radiotherapy to the internal mammary chain. Acute grade 1, 2 and 3 epithelitis was described in 132 (76.3%), 32 (18.5%) and six patients (3.4%), respectively. At 23 months, grade 1 and 2 fibrosis was observed in 31 and eight patients, respectively (18.8 and 4.6%). Left ventricular ejection fraction remained normal for 159 patients (91.9%) before radiotherapy. Among them, 18 (11.3%) experienced a left ventricular ejection fraction alteration, eight (5.0%) at the completion of radiotherapy. Congestive heart failure occurred in one patient (0.6%). Toxicities related to the association of trastuzumab to breast radiotherapy were mild. Further follow-up is warranted. ","1143":"The main indications of brachytherapy for head and neck cancers are limited tumours of the oral cavity, the oropharynx and the nasopharynx. This technique can be exclusive, associated with external radiotherapy or postoperative. This is also a treatment for second localizations in previously irradiated areas. If low-dose rate brachytherapy is the reference, the pulse dose rate brachytherapy by control of the dose rate and optimisation of the dose distribution is the technique to be preferred. High-dose rate brachytherapy is an option. The major prognosis factors of local control and complications are the use of a leaded protection of the mandible, the intersource spacing (1.2-1.4 cm), the volume treated (30 cm(3), i.e. three loops), the safety margin (5 mm), the dose rate (0.5 Gy\/h), the total dose (65 Gy in case of exclusive brachytherapy, 25 Gy in case of a combination of external beam irradiation [50 Gy] and brachytherapy in the oropharyngeal carcinomas, 35 Gy in case of a combination of external beam irradiation [40 Gy] and brachytherapy in the oral cavity carcinomas, 60 Gy in case of a second localization in previous irradiated tissues), the delay between external irradiation and brachytherapy (&lt;20 days), the dose per fraction and the treated volume for high-dose rate brachytherapy. Brachytherapy, when possible, is the optimal method of irradiation of head and neck carcinomas with limited volume.","1144":"The role of the technician in a brachytherapy department is essential for the cohesion of the treatment team made up of the radiation oncologist, the physicist, and the technician. He\/she collaborates in the different treatment steps such as taking care of the patients, training of the professionals and research studies in collaboration with the team. He participates in all steps of the treatment such as preparation, technician's consultation, catheters\/templates and radioactives sources implant, dose distribution analysis and treatment. He looks after the management of planning, radioactive sources and chemist's equipments. He takes part in the training of the junior technician, and support doctors and physicists in different studies. The procedure writing and the presentation of professional practices are also part of the technician task.","1145":"Malignant tumours of the penis are a rare entity. They are mostly squamous cell carcinomas and arise from the glands or the coronal sulcus. Glans brachytherapy has been developed to avoid mutilating surgery and allow organ preservation. Indications of brachytherapy are tumours less than 4 cm with no invasion of the uretra or corpora cavernosa. Local control is equivalent after brachytherapy and surgery. This article describes the indications, the technique, outcome and toxicity of penile brachytherapy.","1146":"The use of image-guided brachytherapy has led to a significant change in application techniques and improvements in treatment planning. Today, 3D imaging has replaced orthogonal radiographs for a large number of treatments, providing a possibility of an optimization adapted to the anatomy of each patient. When properly selected and implemented, this imaging provides accurate 3D information of volumes and brachytherapy device, allowing moving from a dose to points assessment to a dose\/volume evaluation. This article describes the contribution of different imaging modalities for the different brachytherapy techniques: gynecological brachytherapy, interstitial brachytherapy (breast, penis, etc.) and prostate brachytherapy. It reminds recommendations for the establishment of protocols of images acquisition and 3D reconstruction of brachytherapy devices (applicators, plastic tubes, needles, etc.).","1147":"With an experience of more than 25 years for the pioneers (and more than 14 years in France), permanent implant brachytherapy using iodine 125 seeds (essentially) is now recognized as a valuable alternative therapy for localized low-risk prostate cancer patients. The possible extension of the indications of exclusive brachytherapy towards selected patients in the intermediate-risk group has now been confirmed by several studies. Moreover, for the other patients in the intermediate-risk group and for the patients in the high-risk group, brachytherapy, as an addition to external radiotherapy, could represent one of the best ways to escalate the dose. Different permanent implant brachytherapy techniques have been proposed; preplanning or real-time procedure, loose or stranded seeds (or both), manual or automatic injection of the seeds. The main point here is the ability to perfectly master the procedure and to comply with the dosimetric constraints, which have been recently redefined by the international societies, such as the GEC-ESTRO group. Mid- and long-term results, which are now available in the literature, indicate relapse-free survival rates of about 90% at 5-10 years, the best results being obtained with satisfactory dosimetric data. Comparative data have shown that the incontinence and impotence rates after brachytherapy seemed to be significantly inferior to what is currently observed after surgery. However, a risk of about 3 to 5% of urinary retention is usually reported after brachytherapy, as well as an irritative urinary syndrome, which may significantly alter the quality of life of the patients, and last several months. In spite of those drawbacks, with excellent long-term results, low rates of incontinence and impotence, and emerging new indications (focal brachytherapy, salvage brachytherapy after localized failure of an external irradiation), permanent implant prostate brachytherapy can be expected to be proposed to an increasing number of patients in the next future.","1148":"Brachytherapy consists in placing radioactive sources directly in contact with the tumoral bed. The type of source, its characteristics and its use will be adapted regarding the kind of treatment foreseen. Modern brachytherapy techniques employ remote afterloading technologies allowing better quality and security in the delivery of treatment. This development of technology goes with an increase need of quality control of equipments, including radionuclides, and procedures.","1149":"Endobronchial brachytherapy is an invasive technique, which allows localizing radioactive sources at the tumour contact. Therefore, high doses are administered to tumour while healthy tissues can be spared. Initially dedicated to a palliative setting, improvements helped reaching 60 to 88% symptoms alleviation and 30 to 100% of endoscopic macroscopic response. New diagnostic techniques and early diagnosis extended the indications to a curative intent: endoluminal primitive tumour, post radiation endobronchial recurrence, inoperable patients. CT-based dosimetry is a keypoint to optimize treatment quality and to minimize potential side effects, making this treatment a safe and efficient technique for specific indications.","1150":"No technique can now be used without previously considering the safety of patients, staff and public and risk management. This is the case for brachytherapy. The various aspects of brachytherapy are discussed for both the patient and the staff. For all, the risks must be minimized while achieving a treatment of quality. It is therefore necessary to establish a list as comprehensive as possible regardless of the type of brachytherapy (low, high, pulsed dose-rate). Then, their importance must be assessed with the help of their criticality. Radiation protection of personnel and public must take into account the many existing regulation texts. Four axes have been defined for the risk management for patients: organization, preparation, planning and implementation of treatment. For each axis, a review of risks is presented, as well as administrative, technical and medical dispositions for staff and the public.","1151":"Brachytherapy dose distribution calculation has evolved from the simple use of charts to the TG-43 formalism. It depends on the physical and geometrical characteristics of each source, the position of the source relatively to the calculation point and on the medium composition. Its principles and limitations are presented as well as the different dosimetric systems associated with implementing rules and the definition of the prescribed dose. The new generation of algorithms and their contributions are discussed.","1152":"For breast cancer, interstitial brachytherapy remains an accurate irradiation technique for delivering a high dose (increasing the local control) in a small volume (decreasing the toxicity). In this article, we present the technical data related to the breast brachytherapy proceeding, from the implantation of the vectors to the treatment itself, including the planning. The different indications of breast brachytherapy include all the breast irradiations focusing on the initial tumour bed (partial irradiation of the breast), such as boost, accelerated and partial breast irradiation (APBI) and second conservative radiosurgical treatment in case of ipsilateral in-breast recurrence. The results in terms of efficacy and toxicity are presented for each indication. Interstitial breast brachytherapy, performed according with the standard rules, remains a major technique for breast cancer treatment.","1153":"Treatment technique training needs theoretical and practical knowledge allowing proposing the right treatment for the right patient, but also allowing performing the technical gesture in the best conditions for an optimal result with a maximal security. The evolution of the brachytherapy techniques needs the set up of specific theoretical and practical training sessions. The present article focuses on the importance of the brachytherapy training as well as the different means currently available for the young radiation oncologist community for perfecting their education. National and international trainings are presented. The role of the simulation principle in the frame of brachytherapy is also discussed. Even if brachytherapy is not always an easy technique, its efficacy and its medico-economical impact need to be passed down to motivated students with the implementation of relevant educational means.","1154":"The standard of care of local treatment for extremities soft tissue sarcomas relies on conservative surgery combined with external beam radiotherapy. Brachytherapy can be realized instead of external beam radiotherapy in selected cases, or more often used as a boost dose on a limited volume on the area at major risk of relapse, especially if a microscopic positive resection is expected. In these cases, this combination allows to obtain the best local control rates published. Close interaction and communication between radiation oncologist and surgeon are mandatory at the time of implantation to limit the risk of side effects. Long-term results are available for low-dose rate brachytherapy. Nowadays, pulsed dose rate is more often used. More limited experience has been reported for high dose rate.","1155":"Surgery remains the cornerstone of the treatment for endometrial cancer, but brachytherapy plays a major role in the care of patients. In postoperative situations, brachytherapy is frequently indicated to prevent recurrences of the vaginal cuff. In case of medically inoperable patient, it can be, with or without external irradiation, an alternative treatment. In these two situations, techniques are radically different.","1156":"We report the case of a long survival after the treatment of a squamous cell carcinoma of the gallbladder. The patient is a 58-year-old man, who was treated by cholecystectomy, followed by postoperative radiotherapy of the tumour bed at a dose of 45Gy, combined with 5-fluoro-uracil chemotherapy. After 18 years, the patient is alive in complete remission. The end point of this work was to study the clinical and therapeutic characteristics of squamous cell carcinoma of the gallbladder and its prognosis through this case and a review of literature.","1157":"","1158":"Although radiosensitive, spinal locations of Ewing's sarcomas are challenging for the radiation oncologist due to poor radiation tolerance of the spinal cord. However, some favorable anatomical compartments - that may represent more than 20% - were associated with a better outcome and could benefit from a radiation dose escalation using the most recent radiation therapy techniques. We performed a dose escalation study on one patient, declined in two scenarios: (1) a tumour located within a single vertebral body and (2) a locally advanced disease involving the vertebral foramen and paraspinal soft tissues. Five dose-levels are proposed: 44.8Gy, 54.4Gy, 59.2Gy, 65.6Gy and 70.4Gy (1.6Gy per session, 8Gy per week). The 3D-conformational technique is compared with static intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT), helical tomotherapy, volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT), stereotactic body robotic radiation therapy (SBRT) and protontherapy (passive scattering). Two constraints had to be respected in order to skip to the next level: the planned target volume (PTV) coverage must exceed 95% and the D(2%) on the spinal cord shall not exceed a given constraint set at 50Gy in case 1 and 44Gy in case 2 due to initial neurological sufferance. Only protontherapy, SBRT, helical tomotherapy and VMAT appear able to reach the last dose level while respecting the constraints in case 1. On the other hand, only helical tomotherapy seems capable of reaching 59.2Gy on the PTV in case 2. With the most recent radiation therapy techniques, it becomes possible to deliver up to 70.4Gy in a favorable compartment in this sham patient. Unfavorable compartments can receive up to 59.2Gy. Definitive radiation therapy may be an interesting local treatment option to be validated in an early phase trial. ","1159":null,"1160":"The available contouring guidelines for the supraclavicular and infraclavicular lymph nodes appeared to be inadequate for their delineation on non-enhanced computed tomography (CT) scans. For this purpose, we developed delineation guidelines for the clinical target volumes (CTV) of these lymph nodes on non-enhanced CT-slices performed in the treatment position of breast cancer. A fresh female cadaver study as well as delineation and an anatomical descriptions review were performed to propose a simplified definition of the supra- and infraclavicular lymph nodes using readily identifiable anatomical structures. This definition was developed jointly by breast radiologists, breast surgeons, and radiation oncologists. To validate these guidelines, the primary investigator and seven radiation oncologists (observers) independently delineated 10 different nodal CTVs. The primary investigator contours were considered to be the gold standard contours. Contour accuracy and concordance were evaluated. Written guidelines for the delineation of supra- and infraclavicular lymph nodes CTVs were developed. Consistent contours with minimal variability existed between the delineated volumes; the mean kappa index was 0.83. The mean common contoured and additional contoured volumes were 84.6% and 18.5%, respectively. The mean overlap volume ratio was 0.71. Simplified CT-based atlas for delineation of the supra- and infraclavicular lymph nodes for locoregional irradiation of the breast on non-enhanced CT-scan, have been developed in this study. This atlas provides a consistent set of guidelines for delineating these volumes. ","1161":"Evaluation of perioperative treatment of keloid scars with electron beam therapy or iridium 192 low dose rate brachytherapy. From 1994 to 2010, 95 patients with 142 keloid scars have been treated by immediate perioperative irradiation and retrospectively reviewed in our institute: 116 scars were treated by electrontherapy and 26 by brachytherapy. In the electrontherapy group treated locations were: earlobe (n=88, 76%), thorax (n=14, 12%), neck (n=9, 8%), limbs (n=5, 4%). The median size of lesions was 3cm (range [R]: 0.5-18cm). In 95.6% of cases, a dose of 15Gy was delivered in five fractions of 3Gy. The median follow-up was 70 months (R: 7-161 months). The 2-year and 5-year local control were respectively 69% (95% confidence interval [95% CI]: 59-76%) and 55% (95% CI: 45-64%). In the brachytherapy group treated locations were: neck (n=3, 11%), earlobe (n=8, 32%), abdomen (n=3, 11%), thorax (n=2, 8%), limbs (n=10, 38%). The median size of lesions was 6.6cm (R: 1.7-28cm). The median dose delivered at 5mm from the source was 20Gy (R: 15-20.69). The median follow-up was 113 months (R: 21-219 months). The 2-year and 5-year local control were respectively 84.6% (95% CI: 64-94%) and 73.5% (95% CI: 49-87%). So far, no radiation-induced cancer has occurred. A trend to a better local control with brachytherapy was noted (compared to electrontherapy, 2-year relapse is halved with brachytherapy) though this difference did not reach the significance (P=0.0991), probably due to the reduced number of patients in the brachytherapy group. Brachytherapy seems to provide better local control compared to electrontherapy, and should be proposed as first line treatment. However, electrontherapy is an interesting alternative in case of difficulty to realize brachytherapy. There is probably a dose effect: according to published data, 25 to 30Gy should at least be proposed. ","1162":null,"1163":"The success of radiotherapy mainly depends on the total administered dose. This dose must be homogenously delivered onto the tumor and must preserve the surrounding healthy tissue. However, several patients are hypersensitive to ionizing radiations and may develop important radiation-induced early and late side effects. The prediction of these side effects remains currently impossible, involving to limit the given dose with the risk to decrease the therapeutic benefit for patients. Therefore, one of the major challenges in radiobiology is to accurately predict tumour radioresistance and to determine normal tissue radiosensitivity to tailor treatment. Several studies have been carried out and different predictive assays have been described in this field. However, none of them showed significant results for clinical use. For several years, many technological advances in proteomic fields have been performed in order to identify new biomarkers. After a brief description of the main characteristics of tumor radioresistance and normal tissue radiosensitivity, we will develop in this review the different approaches proposed so far to identify predictive tools of radiotherapy outcome. We will then analyze in detail how proteomic studies can improve the understanding of mechanisms associated with radiosensitivity of healthy tissue and radioresistance of tumor cells and how they could highlight new predictive biomarkers in radiobiology.","1164":"To assess the outcome of esophageal cancer according to therapeutic strategy. One-hundred and twenty patients with esophageal cancer treated by an association of radiotherapy and chemotherapy and possibly surgery, between 2004 and 2010, were retrospectively studied. The first site of relapse was classified as follows: local (tumour), locoregional (tumour and\/or nodal: celiac, mediastinal, sus-clavicular) or metastatic. With a 15.7-months (1.4-62) median follow-up, there were 89 deaths and 79 recurrences. Three types of treatments were performed: 50Gy exclusive chemoradiotherapy (47 patients) or 50 to 65Gy exclusive chemoradiotherapy (44 patients) or chemoradiotherapy followed by surgery (27 patients). The local first relapse was as much frequent as distant relapse (50 patients). With a-5cm margin up and down to the tumour, there was only one nodal relapse. Two-year survival was 39.5% (95% confidence interval [IC]: 30.5-40.8) and relapse-free survival was 26.5% (CI: 18.6-35). Multivariate analysis revealed that treatment type and disease stage had a significant impact on survival, relapse-free survival and locoregional control. Compared to exclusive chemoradiotherapy, surgery improved locoregional control (40.2 versus 8.7 months, P=0.0004) but in a younger population. Despite postoperative mortality, the gain was maintained for distance relapse-free survival (40.2 versus 10 months, P=0.0147) and overall survival (29.3 versus 14.2 months, P=0.0088). Compared to 50Gy chemoradiotherapy, local control was improved if high dose chemoradiotherapy was performed (13.8 versus 7.5 months, P=0.05) but not overall survival (14.0 versus 15.4 months, P=0.24). More than one-third relapse is local. Locoregional control is better with high dose chemoradiotherapy. In this study, surgery performed in selected patients only, improved locoregional control, relapse-free disease and overall survival. ","1165":"A 61-year-old man, with a tuberous sclerosis, experienced severe acute reactions during a concomitant chemoradiotherapy regimen after 22Gy and one cycle of 5-fluorouracil-cisplatinum. He was treated for a cervical squamous cell lymph node of unknown origin. Grade 3 mucitis and epitheliitis were observed only in the irradiated fields and required the end of the radiotherapy. Tuberous sclerosis is characterized by a loss of the TSC2 function, with a permanent activation of the mTOR pathway. Logically, some kind of \"radioresistance\" should be observed. Increased radiosensitivity is paradoxical. This case illustrates how radiosensitivity is a complex phenomenon and clinically unpredictable. Efficiency of the protocols associations of mTOR inhibitors and radiotherapy should be carefully scrutinized.","1166":"The authors report a case of Dropped Head Syndrome with an unusually rapid onset after an accident in a patient with a history of Hodgkin's lymphoma cured by chemotherapy and mantle field radiotherapy and compare this case to the rare published cases of chronic Dropped Head Syndrome occurring after this type of treatment. A 56-year-old man was treated at the age 36 years for supra-diaphragmatic Hodgkin's lymphoma by chemotherapy and mantle field radiotherapy according to a standard technique and standard doses (40Gy, 20 fractions, 27 days). Seventeen years after the end of treatment, he experienced a violent whiplash injury, rapidly followed by a Dropped Head Syndrome, similar to the cases of chronic Dropped Head Syndrome already described in the context of Hodgkin's lymphoma (permanent flexion of the head, only reduced in the supine position). Physical and neurophysiological examination, electromyogram, and magnetic resonance imaging confirmed the diagnosis of Dropped Head Syndrome. Very few treatment options are available for the major disability related to Dropped Head Syndrome. This type of subacute onset of Dropped Head Syndrome has not been previously described. The good results of radiation therapy after chemotherapy allow a dose reduction to 30Gy in the involved regions. This, together with recent progress in treatment planning, should allow eradication of these complications.","1167":"Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) allows a better coverage of the target volume and a better saving of organs at risk with a decrease of toxicity in head and neck cancers. It requires more human labor and materials compared to conformational radiotherapy. If they are insufficient, a selection of the patients receiving IMRT may be necessary, raising an ethical problem. We collected the motives guiding the choice of the technique of radiotherapy for head and neck cancers during a month of physicists' shortage. Nineteen patients received IMRT and eight conformational radiotherapy. Conformational irradiation was chosen in palliative and postsurgery treatments, to reduce delay, in laryngeal tumors and re-irradiation. IMRT was preferred for complex target volumes and the localizations at risk of important xerostomia following conformational radiotherapy. These choices were confronted with the bioethics criteria of Beauchamp and Childress. The beneficence justified the use of IMRT or conformational radiotherapy depending on the circumstances. The non-maleficence attempted to decrease the toxicity with IMRT. Justice was questioned by the selection. The autonomy of patients was not totally respected in the choice. To help in the choice of the patients receiving an IMRT in a crisis situation, we proposed a hierarchical organization of selection criteria: complex volumes close to critical organs at risk, localization with high risk of xerostomia, long life expectancy and postoperative delay constraints.

It has been proved with high level of evidence that it decreases local relapse and improves survival of patients. However, radiotherapy comes with healthy tissue toxicity, heart and lung in particular. With constant improvement of radiation techniques, several methods have been developed to decrease the dose to the heart and the lungs. Sometimes, respiratory maneuvers can help, due to patient's anatomy: the radiotherapy is gated with patient's breath. The Deep Inspiration Breath Hold technique is the most popular and there are several ways to perform it.

Between 1971 and 1983, at our service 474 breast cancer patients underwent exclusive conserving radiotherapy treatment. The RT included an initial external irradiation followed by interstitial LDR brachytherapy (37Gy) to the residual tumour. The local regional nodes received 47.5Gy followed by a 15Gy boost delivered to the mammary nodes internal (IMN) and 25Gy axilla. Median follow-up was 139months (8-342).

","1177":"Failure modes and effects analysis (FMEA), is a risk analysis method used at the Radiotherapy Department of Institute Sainte-Catherine as part of a strategy seeking to continuously improve the quality and security of treatments. The method comprises several steps: definition of main processes; for each of them, description for every step of prescription, treatment preparation, treatment application; identification of the possible risks, their consequences, their origins; research of existing safety elements which may avoid these risks; grading of risks to assign a criticality score resulting in a numerical organisation of the risks. Finally, the impact of proposed corrective actions was then estimated by a new grading round. For each process studied, a detailed map of the risks was obtained, facilitating the identification of priority actions to be undertaken. For example, we obtain five steps in patient treatment planning with an unacceptable level of risk, 62 a level of moderate risk and 31 an acceptable level of risk.

It helps to better understand the current geographical distribution of radiotherapy centers in Belgium as well as its possible limitations. RESULTS-CONCLUSION: It appears that the current situation is on the average acceptable in terms of accessibility to the service and that the method presents huge potentialities for decision making so as to yield a spatial system that is both efficient and equitable. ","1183":null,"1184":"To measure the displacement of the tumor of the gross tumor volume (GTV) of thoracic esophageal cancer in the calm states of end-inspiration and end-expiration for determining the internal margin of the GTV (IGTV). Twenty-two patients with thoracic esophageal cancer who were unable to undergo surgery were identified in our hospital. The patients received radiotherapy. By using 16-slice spiral computed tomography (CT), we acquired the calm states of end-inspiration and end-expiration. The displacement and volume changes in tumor target volume were measured, and the changes were analyzed to determine if these were associated with the tidal volume and the location and length of the target volume V. In the end, we analyzed the displacement of tumor target volume and calculated the internal margin of the GTV by empirical formula. The average tidal volume was 463.6 ml. The average GTV at end-inspiration was 33.3 ml and at end-expiration was 33.35 ml. Three was not any significant between two groups (T=-0.034, P&gt;0.05). The IGTV (X-axis direction) was 3.09 mm for the right sector and 4.08 mm for the left border; the IGTV (Z-axis direction) was 3.96 mm for the anterior border and 2.83 mm for the posterior border; and the IGTV (Y-axis direction) was 7.31 mm for the upper boundary (head direction) and 10.16 mm for the lower boundary (feet direction). The motion of the GTV showed no significant correlation with the tidal volume of patients and the length of the tumor, but in relation to the tumor location, the displacement of the lower thoracic and the middle thoracic target volumes occurred in the direction of the anterior and right, which were not significantly different (T=0.859, 0.229, P&gt;0.05) The significant differences were observed for the other directions (P&lt;0.05). Because of respiratory and organ movements, the displacement of the tumor target volume was different in all directions. Therefore, we recommend that expansion of the planning target volume during clinical radiation treatment needs to include the displacement of the tumor target volume caused by respiratory and organ movements during each radiotherapy session. ","1185":null,"1186":"In France, continuing medical education (CME) and professional practice evaluation (PPE) became mandatory by law in July 2009 for all health professionnals. Recently published decrees led to the creation of national specialty councils to implement this organizational device. For radiation oncology, this council includes the French Society for Radiation Oncology (SFRO), the National Radiation Oncology Syndicate (SNRO) and the Association for Continuing Medical Education in Radiation Oncology (AFCOR). The Radiation Oncology National Council will propose a set of programs including CME and PPE, professional thesaurus, labels for CME actions consistent with national requirements, and will organize expertise for public instances. AFCOR remains the primary for CME, but each practitioner can freely choose an organisation for CME, provided that it is certified by the independent scientific commission. The National Order for physicians is the control authority. Radiation oncology has already a strong tradition of independent CME that will continue through this major reform.","1187":"Technology development in radiotherapy has improved significantly during the last decade. The rapid evolution of 3D radiotherapy to intensity-modulated radiotherapy was possible thanks to inverse planning systems. Intensity modulated radiotherapy improved in its turn by possibilities of volumetric irradiation during a single rotation, reducing therefore the overall treatment. This article presents the technical parameters of this volumetric irradiation technique and a review of miscellaneous clinical indications.","1188":"Radiotherapy after breast-conserving therapy for early breast cancer is reported to adversely affect the cosmetic outcome. The incidence of radiation-induced fibroatrophy is around 10% at 5 years. A better knowledge of its pathophysiology has revealed the essential role of activated fibroblasts and reactive oxygen species, mediated by TGF beta 1, allowing the development of antioxidant in the management of the established radiation-induced fibroatrophy. Cosmetic sequelae are evaluated with standardized scales, such as the LENT-SOMA and must be monitored during at least 5 years. The main factors determining the occurrence of sequelae are a large breast volume, dose heterogeneity and the use of tumour bed boost after whole-breast radiation therapy. Intensity modulated radiotherapy and partial breast irradiation position themselves as a good alternatives to reduce the incidence of late skin side effects. The use of predictive tests of intrinsic radiosensitivity might fit into the therapeutic strategy.","1189":"High dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy in intermediate and high-risk prostate cancer patients has started in the late eighties in Europe and the United States, as a boost combined with external beam radiation therapy, as an attractive method for dose escalation. The results of the first dose-escalation study performed at William Beaumont Hospital has established the safety and efficacy of this combined treatment approach. Likewise, this landmark study enabled a paradigm shift in the radiobiology of prostate cancer, demonstrating that the alpha\/beta of prostate cancer was much lower than previously believed to be and therefore the sensitivity of this tumor model to higher-than-conventional doses per fraction led to a dramatic increase of hypofractionated treatment regimens, the object of significant clinical research efforts, currently under way. The excellent toxicity profile and clinical outcome of HDR boost combined treatment prompted investigators to expand HDR brachytherapy indications to low\/intermediate prostate cancer patients as the sole treatment modality. The results, toxicity and a brief review of the literature for both HDR boost and HDR monotherapy will be presented.","1190":"Postoperative radiotherapy remains essential in breast cancer in 2012. After conserving surgery, it reduces local recurrence risks from 50 to 70%, both for ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive cancers. This was confirmed in several randomized trials and three meta-analyses. The boost increases local control in invasive cancers, but its role should be better defined in ductal carcinoma in situ. Among the latter, there is no clearly identified subgroup for which radiotherapy could be avoided. Local recurrence risk factors are now well-identified both for ductal carcinoma in situ and invasive cancers, with an inclusion, for the latter, of new molecular subgroups. After mastectomy, radiotherapy reduces local recurrence rates from 60 to 70%, especially among patients with axillary nodal involvement, with, in parallel, a 7 to 9% increased survival rate. In order to reduce the waiting list and to avoid under treatment, especially in the elderly, several hypofractionated radiotherapy schemes have been developed for several years. Three randomized trials confirmed similar results to classical radiotherapy. For ten years, several techniques of partial breast irradiation have been developed, with various doses and treated volumes. The optimal indications should be defined according to the new international guidelines.","1191":"Adjuvant radiotherapy is a standard component of breast cancer treatment. The addition of radiotherapy after breast conserving surgery has been shown to reduce local recurrence rate and improve long-term survival. Accurate delineation of target volumes and organs at risk is crucial to the quality of treatment planning and delivered accomplished with innovate technologies in radiation therapy. This allows the radiation beam to be shaped specifically to each individual patient's anatomy. Target volumes include the mammary gland and surgical bed in case of breast conserving surgery, the chest wall in case of mastectomy, and if indicated, regional lymph nodes (axillary, supra- and infraclavicular and internal mammary). Organs at risk include lungs, thyroid, brachial plexus, heart, spinal cord and oesophagus. The aim of this article is to encourage the use of conformal treatment and delineation of target volumes and organs at risk and to describe specifically the definition of these volumes.","1192":"Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is a technique allowing dose escalation and normal tissue sparing for various cancer types. For breast cancer, the main goals when using IMRT were to improve dose homogeneity within the breast and to enhance coverage of complex target volumes. Nonetheless, better heart and lung protections are achievable with IMRT as compared to standard irradiation for difficult cases. Three prospective randomized controlled trials of IMRT versus standard treatment showed that a better breast homogeneity can translate into better overall cosmetic results. Dosimetric and clinical studies seem to indicate a benefit of IMRT for lymph nodes irradiation, bilateral treatment, left breast and chest wall radiotherapy, or accelerated partial breast irradiation. The multiple technical IMRT solutions available tend to indicate a widespread use for breast irradiation. Nevertheless, indications for breast IMRT should be personalized and selected according to the expected benefit for each individual.","1193":"Acute radiation-induced esophagitis includes all clinical symptoms (odynophagia, dysphagia) occurring within 90 days after thoracic irradiation start. Its severity can be graded using RTOG and CTCAE scales. The clinical risk factors are: age, female gender, initial performance status, pre-therapeutic body mass index, pre-therapeutic dysphagia, tumoral and nodal stage, delivered dose, accelerated hyperfractionned radiotherapy, concomitant association of chemotherapy to radiotherapy and response to the treatment. The dosimetric parameters predictive of esophagitis are: mean dose, V(20Gy), V(30Gy), V(40Gy), V(45Gy) and V(50Gy). Amifostine is the only drug to have a proven radioprotective efficacy (evidence level C, ESMO recommendation grade III). The medical management of esophagitis associates a diet excluding irritant food, medication against gastroesophageal reflux, analgesic treatment according to the WHO scale and management of dehydration and denutrition by enteral feeding.","1194":"Hypofractionated and accelerated partial breast irradiation are more and more widely used for early breast cancer. Here, this short communication would expose the role of hypofractionated radiotherapy in adjuvant breast radiotherapy, rational, techniques and indications of accelerated partial breast irradiation.","1195":"Information obtained by different methods of image-guided radiotherapy now allows us to reposition the target volume. This evolution causes a change in practice and positioning control. In order to control positioning errors, a systematic control during the first three to five sessions is required. Random repositioning errors and clinical target volume motions can be mastered only by performing a daily imaging. Finally, image-guided radiotherapy allows assessing anatomical changes occurring during treatment, and opens the field of adaptive radiotherapy.","1196":"Percutaneous ablation allows to treat tumours with temperature modifications. These non-invasive techniques are useful to treat metastatic lung tumours in patients with a slowly evolving disease, which requires multiple local treatment. Ablation is therefore proposed as a locoregional treatment because it has a minimal impact on the lung. Other advantages are its efficacy and a low morbidity. Limits may be the tumour size and its location.","1197":"Radiotherapy is a major treatment of pelvic tumours. It exposes to the risk of acute and long-term side effects, such as radiation proctitis. Radiation proctitis is a complex disease requiring support ranging from initial contact with the patient until several years after completion of radiotherapy. This care includes preventive measures (clinical and dosimetric factors), detection and medical and surgical treatments. This article aims to make a review of radiation proctitis induced during the treatment of pelvic cancers.","1198":"Metastatic lung disease has long been the preserve of systemic treatments, local treatments being considered in a purely palliative intention. Several studies have objectified benefit to the local treatment of metastases, especially oligometastases. Surgery then took an important place in this setting, but the development of techniques for stereotactic radiotherapy on the one hand and the refusal or contraindication for surgery on the other hand led authors to conduct studies in this direction. This literature review describes the realization of stereotactic radiotherapy in treating pulmonary oligometastases and evaluates criteria for the selection of patients who would benefit. A comparison between the results of different studies on this technique allowed to show its effectiveness for local control, overall survival and tolerance. Stereotactic radiotherapy has emerged as a viable alternative, effective and well tolerated with local control rates comparable to that obtained by surgery (74 to 100%). Quality of life after stereotactic radiotherapy should be in a near future an important parameter to support this therapeutic choice, and needs to be precisely assessed.","1199":null,"1200":null,"1201":"Solitary metastases have been reported in up to 30% of cases in imaging series. Local treatment aims at consolidating the injured bone and to prevent neurologic complications. Since the prognosis of bony metastatic disease is about 30 months and includes some long survivors, the multisdisciplinary committee in charge of the patient should ask the question and decide on the type of radical\/ablative intervention in case of oligometastases. A literature search was performed using MESH terms (bone, metastases, radiotherapy, radiology, cement, radiofrequency ablation, chemoembolisation). Local ablative treatments can yield symptomatic relief and local control rates of about 90%. Stereotactic hypofractionated irradiation and cementoplasty are increasingly used. In conclusion, local ablative treatment of bony oligometastases is an efficient treatment. Its potential impact on survival remains to be demonstrated prospectively in clinical trials.","1202":"Published series suggest that, in carefully selected patients, long-term survival can be obtained when a complete resection of the primary site and metastasis is achieved. It comprises resection of additional malignant nodules in the contralateral lung (at present classified as M1a, but the additional nodule may be a second primary lung cancer), complete resection of the primary associated with limited metastatic pleural involvement (M1a), and resection of the primary with an isolated extrathoracic metastasis (mostly a single brain or adrenal). All these topics are discussed.","1203":"Image-guided radiotherapy is defined by the use of images acquired in the treatment room to improve the accuracy of patient positioning. Most of imaging devices use X-rays and deliver an additional dose to the patients. These non-negligible doses have to be evaluated and reported. Several studies have investigated organ-absorbed dose due to in-room imaging. Some organ doses are reported to give an idea of the magnitude, in particular for prostate cancer. Then, principles based on the as low as reasonably achievable (ALARA) concept are described and adapted to image-guided radiotherapy. Justification (what is the patient outcome?) and optimisation (image modality, acquisition frequency, treatment site...) are two main issues. They have a really big impact on patient treatment and staff organization.","1204":"Radiofrequency is a thermal ablative technique that is most often used percuteanously under image guidance. Thermal damage is obtained through frictional heating of a high frequency current. The maximal volume of destruction obtained in one radiofrequency delivery is around 4 cm and consequently, best indication for treatment are tumours below 3 cm. When compared, radiofrequency and surgical removal for tumours below 25 mm in diameter demonstrated a rate of incomplete resection\/ablation of 6% and 7.3% respectively. Median survival after the first radiofrequency of a liver metastasis of CRC is reported to be 24 to 52 months with a 5 years overall survival of 18 to 44%. The median overall survival increases from 22 to 48 months depending on the use of radiofrequency ablation as rescue treatment after failure of others, or as a first line treatment. For patients with a single tumour, less than 4 cm, the survival rates at 1, 3, and 5 years are respectively 97%, 84% and 40%, with a median survival of 50 months. Follow-up imaging requires to use contrast-enhanced CT or MRI, looking for local recurrences evidenced by local foci of enhancement at the periphery of the ablation zone.","1205":"Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) are technological developments, which when applied in a model of prostate cancer, led to a significant reduction in the toxicity and digestive and urinary sequelae of 3D conformational radiotherapy. The major clinical benefits of these techniques with regard to reduced digestive and urinary toxicity are unequivocal since very few sequelae have been reported at 10 years (2% of grade 2 and 1% of grade 3 digestive toxicity; 11% of grade 2 and 5% of grade 3 urinary toxicity). Even when these two techniques are combined, IG-IMRT significantly diminishes late genitourinary toxicity. In the absence of adaptive radiotherapy, there are many IGRT protocols and repositioning techniques, and every step in the IGRT process must be carried out with extreme rigor: installing the patient and contention system, repositioning technique with or without fiduciary markers, type of repositioning imaging, definition of margins inherent in each technique (prostate, seminal vesicles and\/or pelvic lymph nodes), frequency of repositioning during treatment, dietary constraints with or without rectal lavage. For these reasons, every centre that performs IGRT must carefully and rigorously assess the uncertainties of repositioning linked to the IGRT technique. In this review, we analyzed data from the literature based on dosimetric studies and the proven clinical impact in order to answer the different questions asked by radiation oncologists at every step of the IGRT process for cancer of the prostate. Recommendations are made for the repositioning protocols according to the most widely used repositioning techniques: fiduciary markers or soft tissues, kV-CBCT or MV-CBCT, 3D ultrasonography.","1206":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the impact of radiation therapy on sexual life. The analysis was based on a Pubmed literature review. The keywords used for this research were \"sexual, radiation, oncology, and cancer\". After a brief reminder on the anatomy and physiology, we explained the main complications of radiation oncology and their impact on sexual life. Preventive measures and therapeutic possibilities were discussed. Radiation therapy entails local, systematic and psychological after-effects. For women, vaginal stenosis and dyspareunia represent the most frequent side effects. For men, radiation therapy leads to erectile disorders for 25 to 75% of the patients. These complications have an echo often mattering on the patient quality of life of and on their sexual life post-treatment reconstruction. The knowledge of the indications and the various techniques of irradiation allow reducing its potential sexual morbidity. The information and the education of patients are essential, although often neglected. In conclusion, radiation therapy impacts in variable degrees on the sexual life of the patients. Currently, there are not enough preventive and therapeutic means. Patient information and the early screening of the sexual complications are at stake in the support of patients in the reconstruction of their sexual life.","1207":"Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) aims to take into account anatomical variations occurring during irradiation by visualization of anatomical structures. It may consist of a rigid registration of the tumour by moving the patient, in case of prostatic irradiation for example. IGRT associated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is strongly recommended when high-dose is delivered in the prostate, where it seems to reduce rectal and bladder toxicity. In case of significant anatomical deformations, as in head and neck tumours (tumour shrinking and decrease in volume of the salivary glands), replanning appears to be necessary, corresponding to the adaptive radiotherapy. This should ideally be \"monitored\" and possibly triggered based on a calculation of cumulative dose, session after session, compared to the initial planning dose, corresponding to the concept of dose-guided adaptive radiotherapy. The creation of \"planning libraries\" based on predictable organ positions (as in cervical cancer) is another way of adaptive radiotherapy. All of these strategies still appear very complex and expensive and therefore require stringent validation before being routinely applied.","1208":null,"1209":"Many clinical studies have showed the key role of radiotherapy in anticancer treatment strategy. Radiations are delivered alone or in combination with systemic therapies. In recent years, the main goal of all clinical developments has focused on improving clinical benefit, with an increased tumour control and a higher normal tissue protection. This research was designed to reduce local recurrences, to increase recurrence-free or overall survival and to decrease acute and late effects. Technological and biological evolutions (or revolutions) accompanied clinicians to improve clinical benefit, namely with strong progress in radiology and better understanding of radiobiology, particularly at the molecular level. Differences in tumour and normal tissues radiosensitivity are nowadays integrated in daily clinical practice of radiation oncologists. The current report details the last 5-year developments of clinical and translational research in radiation oncology, especially the role of French teams in the development of personalized treatment.","1210":"Mucositis is a major side effect induced by radiotherapy and\/or chemotherapy of head and neck cancer. This toxicity impacts patient's quality of life and may compromise optimal treatments. Pathophysiology, risk factors, incidence and consequences of mucositis will be discussed in this review. Its management remains principally supportive (pain medication and nutritional support); however, in recent years several studies have revealed that the use of low level energy laser is particularly useful in the prevention and treatment of chemo- and radio-induced mucositis.","1211":"The authors report a 71-year-old woman case who developed, 7 years after a cerebral radiation therapy for a parietooccipital glioblastoma, a stroke-like migraine attacks after radiotherapy syndrome (SMART syndrome), a rare complication characterized by reversible neurologic deficits with migraine described after cerebral irradiation. Transient gyriform reversible enhancement is found on MRI during crises. This case report allows discussing the clinical, iconographic presentation and the clinical outcome of this syndrome at the light of the literature publication.","1212":"Acute radiation dermatitis remains one of the most commonly observed side effect during radiation therapy leading to complication such as superinfection or treatment disruption. Its management is characterized by a great heterogeneity. Few strategies have demonstrated a benefit in preventing radiation dermatitis, which relies mostly on decreasing dose delivered to the skin and skin care practices. Simple emollients and use of topical steroids can be useful in early stages. The singularity of the skin toxicity seen with cetuximab and radiotherapy warrants a specific grading system and distinctive clinical treatment with use of antibiotics.","1213":"Although the same simple laws govern cancer outcome (cell division repeated again and again), each tumour has a different outcome before as well as after irradiation therapy. The linear-quadratic radiosensitivity model allows an assessment of tumor sensitivity to radiotherapy. This model presents some limitations in clinical practice because it does not take into account the interactions between tumour cells and non-tumoral bystander cells (such as endothelial cells, fibroblasts, immune cells...) that modulate radiosensitivity and tumor growth dynamics. These interactions can lead to non-linear and complex tumor growth which appears to be random but that is not since there is not so many tumors spontaneously regressing. In this paper we propose to develop a deterministic approach for tumour growth dynamics using chaos theory. Various characteristics of cancer dynamics and tumor radiosensitivity can be explained using mathematical models of competing cell species.","1214":null,"1215":"Systemic treatments rarely allow durable disease control at a metastatic stage. However, distinct metastatic profiles should be considered: from an oligometastatic state (one to five metastases) to disseminated metastases. Biomolecular mechanisms of metastatic spread and patterns of presentation and care were studied. A review of the literature focusing on local ablative treatments of oligometastases was performed. Improvement of local treatments, including surgical ablation, radiofrequency and irradiation (mostly with stereotactic radiotherapy) allow for metastatic control rates at treated sites of over 70% and increased survival with preserved quality of life. Improvements of ablative local treatments have dramatically modified the management of the oligometastatic disease. Metastatic disease may become in rare occasions a chronic disease, with some patients experiencing prolonged remission or even cure, provided proper selection of patients for local aggressive treatments using optimal criteria and scores that remains to be defined.","1216":null,"1217":"The aim of this paper is to describe the difficulties encountered when implementing stereotactic radiotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer (T1-T2, N0, M0) using a voluntary breath-hold technique. From 25\/03\/2010 to 22\/02\/2011, eight patients with a non-small cell lung cancer were selected for treatment. CT images were obtained with the patient maintaining breath-hold using a spirometer. Treatment was delivered when the patient maintains this level of breath-hold. Treatment was performed with a 4 MV and 10 MV photon beams from a linear accelerator Varian 2100CS, equipped with a 120 leaves collimator. 60 Gy or 48 Gy were delivered, in four sessions, to the 80% isodose. The planning target volume (PTV) was defined by adding a 5mm margin to the internal target volume (ITV), the ITV corresponding to the gross tumour volume (GTV) plus a 3mm margin. CTV is considered equal to GTV. The non-understanding of the gating technique, the great number of beams and the limited breath-hold times led to the failure of some treatments. It can be explained by some patients insufficient respiratory abilities and the low dose rate of one of the beams used for treatment, thus forcing some radiation fields to be delivered in two or three times. Implementing such a technique can be limited by the patients' physical abilities and the materials used. Some solutions were found: a training phase more intense with a coaching of the breath-hold technique more precise, or the use of an abdominal compression device.","1218":"To evaluate the predictors of acute radiation pneumonitis after conformal thoracic radiotherapy in the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Forty-seven consecutive patients were treated with conformal thoracic irradiation for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer and retrospectively analysed. The mean total dose of radiotherapy was 65 Gy with respiratory gating in 19 cases. Neoadjuvant and concomitant chemotherapy was performed in 33 patients (70%) and 41 patients (87%) respectively. Eleven patients (23%) had an acute radiation pneumonitis, resulting in death for one patient. In univariate analysis, age, sex, pretherapeutic value of forced expiratory volume, non-gated radiotherapy and type of concomitant chemotherapy did not appear as contributing factors in contrast to the administration of neoadjuvant gemcitabine (P=0.03). The occurrence of acute radiation pneumonitis was significantly associated with non-tumour lung volumes irradiated to 13 Gy (V13, P=0.04), 20 Gy (V20, P=0.02) and 25 Gy (V25, P=0.006), the mean lung dose (P=0.008) and lung normal tissue complication probability (P=0.004). In multivariate logistic regression analysis, the occurrence of acute radiation pneumonitis was significantly associated with age above 75 years (odds ratio [OR]=16.72 ; P=0.02) and with administration of neoadjuvant gemcitabine (OR=18.08, P=0.04). Acute radiation pneumonitis is a common acute side effect of the conformal thoracic radiotherapy of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, requiring close post-treatment follow-up, particularly for elderly patients. The use of gemcitabine before radiation should be avoided. The benefits and risks of conformal thoracic radiotherapy must be carefully analyzed in view of the dosimetric parameters obtained. ","1219":"Breast conserving treatment (breast conserving surgery followed by whole breast irradiation) has commonly been used in early breast cancer since many years. New radiation modalities have been recently developed in early breast cancers, particularly accelerated partial breast irradiation. Three-dimensional conformal accelerated partial breast irradiation is the most commonly used modality of radiotherapy. Other techniques are currently being developed, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, arctherapy, and tomotherapy. The present article reviews the indications, treatment modalities and side effects of accelerated partial breast irradiation.","1220":"To study the localization, treatment and prognosis of extramedullary plasmocytoma through a series of eight patients and a literature review. Eight patients with extramedullary plasmocytoma were treated in the university's hospital of Sfax in Tunisia. The average age was 57.3 years. Female represented 75% of patients. The diagnosis of plasmocytoma was based on anatomo-pathology and immunohistochemistry of a biopsy or resected tumour. Extramedullary location was confirmed if biological and radiological exams and medullary biopsy were normal. The therapeutic decision was made after multidisciplinary meetings regarding tumour location and anterior treatment. Solitary extramedullary plasmocytoma was located in nasal cavity, cervical node, testis, ovary, bladder and the tongue. One patient was treated for three simultaneous locations of extramedullary plamocytoma (node, bowel, pleura) without evidence of myeloma. Radiotherapy was proposed in six cases but refused in one case (plasmocytoma of the bladder is currently receiving radiotherapy). Treatment consisted in chemotherapy in two cases. Evaluation after treatment revealed complete remission in 86% of the cases. Nodal recurrence was noted in two cases. These two patients were lost to follow up. The five other patients were in complete remission after a mean follow up of 5.7 years. No local recurrence or myeloma was noted. Extramedullary plasmocytoma is a rare affection. It can occur in any region of the body. Head and neck is most frequent localization. The treatment is irradiation or surgery in some localization. Progression to myeloma is the most important factor that influences the prognosis of the disease. ","1221":"To compare respiratory-gated conformal radiotherapy versus conventional conformal radiotherapy for the irradiation of non-small cells lung cancer and breast cancer. The STIC 2003 project was a comparative, non-randomized, multicenter and prospective study that included in 20 French centers between April 2004 and June 2008, 634 evaluable patients, 401 non-small cells lung cancer and 233 breast cancers. The final results confirmed the feasibility and good reproducibility of the various respiratory-gated conformal radiotherapy systems regardless of tumour location. The results of this study demonstrated a marked reduction of dosimetric parameters predictive of pulmonary, cardiac and esophageal toxicity, especially for non-small cells lung cancer, as a result of the various respiratory gating techniques. These dosimetric benefits were mainly observed with deep inspiration breath-hold techniques (ABC and SDX), which markedly increased the total lung volume compared to the inspiration-synchronized system based on tidal volume (RPM). For non-small cells lung cancer, these theoretical dosimetric benefits were correlated with a significant reduction in clinically acute and late toxicities, especially the pulmonary. For breast cancer, although less clear due to the lower total dose, there was a decrease in the dose delivered to the heart, potentially reducing the risk of cardiac toxicity in the long-term, especially during the irradiation of the left breast, and a reduction in dose to the contra lateral breast. Respiratory-gated radiotherapy appears to be essential to reduce the risk of acute and late toxicities, especially for lungs and heart, during irradiation of non-small cells lung cancer and breast cancers. ","1222":"Phimosis of the foreskin after radiotherapy for rectal carcinoma is extremely rare and has previously been described only once (2006) in the English-language literature. Combination chemo\/radiotherapy is currently the treatment of choice and widely used in the management of various pelvic malignancies. In this report, we describe a rare complication on male genitalia following the radiotherapy for lower rectal cancers. Few days following the completion of radiotherapy, patient developed phimosis of the foreskin, which was successfully treated medically without the need for circumcision. Radiotherapy can bring a great risk of injury to anorectum and its adjacent structures. Risk of phimosis should be considered under the current radiation guidelines and we support the concept of using penile shielding for all radiotherapy procedures in colorectal carcinoma patients.","1223":"Radiosurgery as treatment for arteriovenous malformations has shown a good efficacy in reducing intracranial bleeding due to rupture. The choice of therapeutic modalities is based on evolutive risk and arteriovenous malformations volume, patient profile and risks stratification following therapeutic techniques (microsurgery, radiosurgery, embolization). Nidus size, arteriovenous malformations anatomical localization, prior embolization or bleeding, distributed dose are predictive factors for radiosurgery's good results and tolerance. This review article will highlight arteriovenous malformations radiosurgery indications and discuss recent irradiation alternatives for large arteriovenous malformation volumes.","1224":null,"1225":"Pituitary adenomas represent 10 to 20% of all primary brain tumours. The main classifications consider their size, micro- and macroadenomas, and their properties, secreting or non-functioning. These characteristics determine the choice of treatment, surgery and medical therapy on first line in many cases. Conventional radiotherapy, whose efficiency has been demonstrated, is indicated in the post-operative setting for lesions at high risk of relapse, recurrences, contra-indications to surgery and intolerance or resistance to medical therapies. Optimal target volume delineation is critical, owing to the proximity of organs at risk and a risk of late toxicity for these patients who have normal life expectancy. Technological, computering and imaging advances have led to conformal radiotherapy, intensity-modulated treatment and stereotaxy. These new techniques are reviewed through a recent literature search. Local control rates are high, although follow-up is still short. Indications for radiosurgery are restricted by the size of the lesions. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy potentially reduces late toxicity, but longer follow-up is necessary.","1226":null,"1227":null,"1228":"Stereotactic radiotherapy is a very high precision procedure, which has been limited to radiosurgery for a long time. Technological improvements allowed the development of radiotherapy in stereotactic conditions, leading to a lot of innovations. Previously indicated for cerebral pathologies, this procedure is now developed for extracerebral locations. In paediatrics, stereotactic radiotherapy is still limited, delivered precociously, due to the possibility of long-term late effects that needs to be addressed. This review reports the different useful conditions, technical evolutions, and the current validated paediatric indications, with differences from adults, and future directions.","1229":"Meningiomas are the most common non-malignant tumours of the brain. Gross-total resection remains the preferred treatment, if achievable without morbidity. Radiation therapy is advocated for inoperable, incompletely resected, or recurrent grade 1 tumours, if there is a progressive, symptomatic lesion, or in case of functional impairment. Postoperative radiation therapy is recommended for grade 2 or 3 lesions. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery are high precision techniques, allowing good sparing of surrounding tissues. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy and stereotactic radiosurgery give comparable results, with excellent 5-year tumour control rates of more than 90% for benign meningiomas. Toxicity is low and seems equivalent, despite a biased use of fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy for larger meningiomas, close to critical structures. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy seems to be of special interest in the treatment of cavernous sinus or optic pathways meningiomas. The different therapeutic modalities should be discussed by a multidisciplinary team.","1230":null,"1231":null,"1232":null,"1233":"Stereotactic radiosurgery is now well implanted in the radiotherapy treatment tools of brain metastasis. The dose can be delivered in one or multiple sessions. Results seem equivalent. CT scan and MRI imaging are required to delineate and calculate dosimetry. Doses are variable according to the size of the metastases, localization, pathology or equipment. Stabilization or reduction of tumour size is the rules after stereotactic treatment. Impact in terms of overall survival is more difficult to apprehend because of the general context of the disease. Many questions remain unresolved, such as the usefulness of whole brain irradiation, adaptation of the treatment schedule to tumour pathophysiology, role of stereotactic treatment after surgery of metastases, etc.","1234":"The aim of this article was the study of the successive steps permitting the prescription of dose in stereotactic intracranial radiotherapy, which includes radiosurgery and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy. The successive steps studied are: the choice of stereotactic intracranial radiotherapy among the therapeutic options, based on curative or palliative treatment intent, then the selection of lesions according to size\/volume, pathological type and their number permitting the choice between radiosurgery or fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy, which have the same methodological basis. Clinical experience has determined the level of dose to treat the lesions and limit the irradiation of healthy adjacent tissues and organs at risk structures. The last step is the optimization of the different parameters to obtain a safe compromise between the lesion dose and healthy adjacent structures. Study of dose-volume histograms, coverage indices and 3D imaging permit the optimization of irradiation. For lesions close to or included in a critical area, the prescribed dose is planned using the inverse planification method. Implementation of the successively described steps is mandatory to insure the prescription of an optimized dose. The whole procedure is based on the delineation of the lesion and adjacent healthy tissues. There are sometimes difficulties to assess the delineation and the volume of the target, however improvement of local control rates and reduction of secondary effects are the proof that the totality of the successive procedures are progressively improved. In practice, stereotactic intracranial radiotherapy is a continually improved treatment method, which constantly benefits from improvements in the choice of indications, imaging, techniques of irradiation, planification\/optimization methodology and irradiation technique and from data collected from prolonged follow-up.","1235":"","1236":"Constant progress in medical imaging and particularly magnetic resonance imaging has profound impact in planning for stereotactic radiosurgery and radiotherapy. The purpose of this paper is to discuss the integration of medical imaging modalities in the planning process. Principles of generic algorithms to calculate stereotactic coordinates are treated for tomographic imaging and digital substraction angiography, and their accuracies are analyzed in a review of the literature. The algorithmic foundations and performance of automatic intermodality co-registration methods are developed. Finally, the MRI sequences useful in planning and follow-up are discussed and the role of MR angiographic sequences compared to conventional X-ray angiography in the particular case of the arteriovenous malformation planning.","1237":"Radical mastectomy is still required in many cases, such as inflammatory breast cancer, multicentric breast cancer, large tumour volume and small breast size. In this setting, immediate breast reconstruction is more and more offered for breast cancer patients. But such plastic surgery is still debated, owing to risks of implant complications when postoperative radiotherapy of chest wall is mandatory in locoregional breast cancer management. Here, the review is focused on different type of immediate breast reconstruction and on risk of implants complications with or without postoperative radiotherapy.","1238":null,"1239":"","1240":null,"1241":"Radiation therapy plays an essential role in the treatment of invasive breast cancer. However, prophylactic treatment of supra- and infraclavicular lymph nodes is not consensual, with different treatment depending on the centres and practitioners. Clinical indications for radiotherapy of the supra- and infraclavicular lymph nodes are often the subject of a consensus. Nevertheless, radiotherapy induces some toxicity. Various techniques have been developed. To date, conformal radiotherapy allows an accurate assessment of doses to target volumes and organs at risk, but at the cost of a sometime complex delineation. This article reviews the literature on radiation of supra- and infraclavicular lymph nodes, with a special focus on technical aspects in delineation and its potential toxicity.","1242":"The oropharyngeal candidiasis is a common condition in cancer patients treated by irradiation, during and after their treatment. For example, almost 70% of patients treated with chemoradiation for head and neck cancer are colonized, and 40% of symptomatic patients have an oropharyngeal candidiasis. Furthermore, we noticed an increase in non-albicans Candida strains, which are present in almost 50% of samples. Cancer treatments, especially radiation therapy, and comorbidities are risk factors of oropharyngeal candidiasis. Oropharyngeal candidiasis has substantial effects on quality of life, and may limit treatment. Epidemiologic data, physiopathology, clinical diagnosis criteria, consequences and treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis will be discussed in this article.","1243":"Technological advances in medical imaging has resulted in the exponential increase of the number of images per examination, caused the irreversible decline of the silver film and imposed digital imaging.

Its pathogenic aspects remain unknown and it has been described at several sites, but it is rarely found in the conjunctiva. We report a case in a patient aged 66, revealed by a tumefaction of the internal angle of the left eye. The initial examination found a tumoral lesion in the medial canthus, extending to the medial half of the lower eyelid and a preauricular lymphadenopathy. Facial computed tomography scan showed that the lesion was responsible for an osteolysis of the medial wall of the left orbit. Histologic examination showed a proliferation of undifferentiated tumour cells with an intratumoral lymphocytic infiltrate. Immuno-histochemical evaluation led to a diagnosis of lymphoepithelial carcinoma (cytokeratin 7+, cytokeratin 20+, vimentin-). No Epstein-Barr viral genomic sequences were detected by in situ hybridization. Nasofibroscopy was normal. Treatment was a wide excision with enucleation, followed by 50 Gy external radiotherapy. After a follow-up period of 18 months, the patient was still in a situation of complete remission.","1246":null,"1247":null,"1248":"The implementation of new techniques of imaging in the daily practice of the radiation oncologist is a major advance in these last 10 years. This allows optimizing the therapeutic intervals and locoregional control of the disease while limiting side effects. Among them, positron emission tomography (PET) offers an opportunity to the clinician to obtain data relative to the tumoral biological mechanisms, while benefiting from the morphological images of the computed tomography (CT) scan. Recently hybrid PET\/CT has been developed and numerous studies aimed at optimizing its use in the planning, the evaluation of the treatment response and the prognostic value. The choice of the radiotracer (according to the type of cancer and to the studied biological mechanism) and the various methods of tumoral delineation, require a regular update to optimize the practices. We propose throughout this article, an exhaustive review of the published researches (and in process of publication) until December 2011, as user guide of PET\/CT in all the aspects of the modern radiotherapy (from the diagnosis to the follow-up): biopsy guiding, optimization of treatment planning and dosimetry, evaluation of tumor response and prognostic value, follow-up and early detection of recurrence versus tumoral necrosis. In a didactic purpose, each of these aspects is approached by primary tumoral location, and illustrated with representative iconographic examples. The current contribution of PET\/CT and its perspectives of development are described to offer to the radiation oncologist a clear and up to date reading in this expanding domain.","1249":"In vivo dosimetry measurements are accepted when the difference between measured and calculated dose is under 5%. A statistical analysis has been conducted to determine whether this tolerance matched the clinical practice for the studied localizations: pelvis, thorax, head and neck, breast. The technical characteristics of the detectors were checked before being used in clinical practice. Then an automatic statistical analysis was implemented using the 2450 in vivo dosimetry measurements obtained during 1 year. The global average is 1.10%, the standard deviation 2.46% and the percentage of out of level measurements 4.09%. By distinguishing the localizations, the 5% tolerance appeared to be too narrow for the breast localization. Several investigations were initiated to justify the modification of the tolerance for the breast localization. They highlighted an underestimation of the calculated dose when high beam angles are set: a new correction factor was defined to take account this error. A specific tolerance was also specified for the breast localization. ","1250":"In the treatment of brain metastases, whole brain radiotherapy can be carried out according two distinct methods: one using multileaf collimator for field shaping and protection of organs at risk, and a second one is to make a rotation of the field to avoid the eyes. The aim of the study was to compare for 10 patients the dose distributions at organs at risk for each method. Patients received 30 Gy in 10 fractions. Except for parotid glands, the dose received by organs at risk and the planning target volume was the same with each method. For whole brain radiotherapy, excluding the cisterna cerebellomedullaris, the mean parotid dose was 9.63 Gy using the multileaf collimator versus 12.32 Gy using the field rotation (P=0.04). For whole brain radiotherapy including the cisterna cerebellomedullaris, the mean parotid dose was 11.12 Gy using the multileaf collimator versus 20.06 Gy using field rotation (P&lt;0.001). Using the multileaf collimator seems recommended for whole brain radiotherapy, to reduce the dose to the parotids.","1251":"The oncologist is confronted daily by questions related to the fact that any patient presents a specific evolution for his cancer: he is challenged by very different, unexpected and often unpredictable outcomes, in some of his patients. The mathematical approach used today to describe this evolution has recourse to statistics and probability laws: such an approach does not ultimately apply to one particular patient, but to a given more or less heterogeneous population. This approach therefore poorly characterizes the dynamics of this disease and does not allow to state whether a patient is cured, to predict if he will relapse and when this could occur, and in what form, nor to predict the response to treatment and, in particular, to radiation therapy. Chaos theory, not well known by oncologists, could allow a better understanding of these issues. Developed to investigate complex systems producing behaviours that cannot be predicted due to a great sensitivity to initial conditions, chaos theory is rich of suitable concepts for a new approach of cancer dynamics. This article is three-fold: to provide a brief introduction to chaos theory, to clarify the main connecting points between chaos and carcinogenesis and to point out few promising research perspectives, especially in radiotherapy.","1252":"To assess the outcome of cervical carcinoma with positive nodes on fluorodesoxyglucose positon emission tomography scans (FDG-PET). Patients with cervical carcinoma who had pelvic and\/or para-aortic lymph nodes involvement by FDG-PET and treated with a curative intent from 2003 to 2007 were retrospectively studied. All patients received pelvic (and possibly para-aortic) radiotherapy with chemotherapy, followed by brachytherapy, and possibly surgery. The first site of relapse was classified as follows: local, nodal (pelvic or para-aortic) or metastatic. Forty patients were included the study. Median age was 47 years (range: 28-78). Thirty patients had nodal involvement limited to pelvic area and ten had a para-aortic involvement. Median follow-up was 42.5 months (range: 11-85). There were 22 relapses and 20 deaths: 20 due to relapse and one due to late toxicity. Three-year survival is 50 % (95 % confidence interval [CI]: 36-65). First relapse was: metastatic for 33 % (13\/40), local for 20 % (8\/40) and isolated nodal for 5 % (2\/40). Multivariate analysis has revealed that only staging according to International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics (FIGO) and para-aortic involvement had a significant impact on survival. Three-year survival was 58 % (CI: 39-74) and 24 % (CI: 7-57) (P=0.009) in patient without and with para-aortic involvement, respectively. Para-aortic involvement by FDG-PET is a significant prognostic factor for overall survival. Local control at primary site remains of paramount importance for patient with nodal involvement. Isolated nodal failures are scarce.

We present a general review of the literature about the risk factors for developing a secondary breast cancer, which is the most frequent secondary tumour in this population. We suggest that contouring the prepubescent breast as an organ at risk may help predict the risk and reduce the dose to the breasts using modern radiotherapy techniques.","1257":"To study the frequency and risk factors for upper limb lymphedema through a series of patients treated for breast cancer. It is a retrospective study about 222 patients treated for breast cancer during the period between February 1993 and December 2003 in Sfax hospitals. Average age was 51 years (27-92 years). Tumour was T2 in 59% of cases. All patients had surgery with lymph node dissection. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma was the most frequent histological type (80% of cases), with predominant SBR II grade (62%). The mean number of removed lymph nodes was 12 (2-33). Axillary lymph node metastasis was detected in 124 patients. Radiotherapy was delivered in 200 patients, including axillary irradiation in 30 cases. The mean follow-up was 68 months (12-120). Lymphedema appeared in 23% of cases (51 patients), 14 months after surgery (mean period). Lymphedema affected the brachium in 17% of cases, the forearm in 12% of cases and all upper limb in 71% of cases. Fifty percent of patients had rehabilitation. However, improvement of lymphedema was obtained in 18 cases. Parameters predicting lymphedema were studied. Significant risk factors were obesity, infection and a number of removed lymph node above 10. The type of surgery, axillary irradiation and shoulder abduction deficit did not predict lymphedema. Lymphedema of the arm is a frequent consequence of breast cancer treatment. The risk of lymphedema is correlated with obesity, infection and a number of removed lymph node above 10.

Medical records of 72 women who developed either ductal carcinoma in situ or stage I-III invasive carcinoma of the breast after Hodgkin lymphoma between 1978 and 2009 were retrospectively reviewed. Median age at Hodgkin lymphoma diagnosis was 23 years old. Median total dose received by the mediastinum was 40 Gy, mostly by a mantle field technique. Breast cancer occurred after a median time interval of 21 years. Ductal invasive carcinoma and ductal carcinoma in situ represented respectively 71% and 19% of the cases. Locoregional treatment for breast cancer consisted of mastectomy with or without radiotherapy in 39 patients and of lumpectomy with or without adjuvant radiotherapy in 32 patients. The isocentric lateral decubitus radiation technique was used in 17 patients after breast conserving surgery (57%). With a median follow-up of 7 years, 5-year overall survival rate and locoregional control rate were respectively 74.5% and 82% for invasive carcinoma and 100% and 92% for in situ carcinoma. Thirteen patients died of progressive breast cancer and contralateral breast cancer was diagnosed in ten patients (14%). Breast conserving treatment can be an option for breast cancers that occur after Hodgkin lymphoma despite prior thoracic irradiation. It should consist of lumpectomy and adjuvant breast radiotherapy with use of adequate techniques, such as the lateral decubitus isocentric position.

However, its effectiveness is often limited by intrinsic resistance of cancer cells and the radiation toxicity of the surrounding normal tissue. New paradigms in oncology are not only focused on tumor cells, but also considered non-transformed from the stromal cells as potential therapeutic target. Among the different cell types, endothelial cells play a singular role, due by their presence, in the vast majority of tumors but also of healthy tissue. This review proposes to participate in the understanding of the response of the endothelium, in the radiation sensitivity of tumor and healthy tissue after radiotherapy.","1261":"The infection of the head and neck epithelium by high-risk human papillomaviruses (HPV) is a risk factor for cancer onset and development. The incidence of HPV-related head and neck squamous cell carcinoma is currently increasing. These lesions display distinct clinical features. HPV positive patients are often younger and have a smaller history of tobacco smoking and alcohol drinking, but have a history of virus-transmitting sex practices. HPV-related tumours are mainly found in the oropharynx, are more associated to a local lymph node invasion and display a poorly differentiated morphology. Despite these more aggressive features, HPV-positive head and neck squamous cell carcinomas correlate with an improved local control, disease-free and global survival. It is thought that HPV-driven specific biologic abnormalities underlie higher tumour sensitivity to chemotherapeutic drugs and ionizing radiations. The expression of the HPV E6 and E7 oncoproteins induce cell transformation by interfering with cell signalling pathways involved in apoptosis, cell cycle, angiogenesis and induce the overexpression of the CDKN2A gene. Therefore, alternative treatments based on therapies targeting these pathways in combination with radiation dose de-escalation could be proposed to HPV-positive patients, if they are properly and reliably identified.","1262":"The objective of this study was to compare prospectively the delineations of tumour bed after breast conserving surgery from two techniques for defining the target volume. Sixteen patients treated by lumpectomy with development of surgical clips were included. For each patient, four radiation oncologists delineated the clinical target volume (CTV boost) following its own method (technique 1) or using a predefined methodology (technique 2), the diameter to be applied around each clip relative to the risk of local recurrence. Factors taken into account to adjust the volume were tumour size, age, surgical margins and the presence of extensive ductal carcinoma. We then analyzed the factors varying the volume and variation of delineation for each method by calculating the concordance index: Kappa index and overlap. For all 16 patients, the volume delineated was nearly identical: 29.65 cm(3) with technique 1 and 33.54 cm(3) with technique 2 (P=0.6). The correlation was higher with technique 2 over technique 1, with KI from 0.146 to 0.285 (P=0.0001) and an OV of 0.302 to 0.458 (P=0.0002). Our study shows that within the same institute, there is a great variability in CTV delineation boost, even in the presence of surgical clips. A standardized approach to adjusting the volume of relapse risk factors has improved the consistency. ","1263":"Despite significant progress in the treatment of glioblastoma, the prognosis of these radioresistant, invasive and hypoxic tumours remain dark. The constant relapse after treatment of this tumour is in part due to its intra-cellular but also micro-environmental radioresistance, largely controlled by growth factors and their receptors. The complexity of the biology of these tumours and the presence of numerous cross-talks between the pathways of these different growth factors can be in part responsible for the negative results obtained in clinical trials associating radiotherapy and targeted drugs designed without previous in vitro and in vivo studies validating the proof of concept of a specific target as key factor of radioresistance. In the aim to optimize the treatment of glioblastoma and to reduce the risks of failure of new trials, several laboratories and clinical departments are developing translational research in radiotherapy and radiobiology, validating in vitro and then in orthotopic xenografts interesting targets, then studying the radiosensitizing effect of targeted drugs directed against these proteins, studying the mechanisms of action and resistance of these drugs, validating these proteins as predictive factors of response to radiotherapy in the patients, and then designing clinical trials, integrating metabolic or functional imaging and surrogate markers to better understand the mechanism of action of these associations. We describe in this article the main translational research axis developed for radiosensitizing glioblastoma, which our lab and department have pursued for several years.","1264":"Carbon ions, thanks to their relative biological effectiveness much higher than that of photons and protons and their ballistic characteristics similar to those of protons, can effectively treat radioresistant tumours. The reasons for this increased efficiency are found in the microdosimetric and radiobiological features of ions. The energy deposit or linear energy transfer increases along the range and reaches a very high level at the end producing the Bragg peak, where the linear energy transfer is about hundred times higher than that of photons. These massive energy deposits create multiple DNA lesions that are difficult to repair. DNA repair is associated with longer blockage of the cell cycle and more frequent chromosomal aberrations that are lethal to cells. The types of cell death are identical to those triggered in response to photon irradiation, but the response is earlier and more important at equivalent physical dose. Radiobiological differences between carbon ions and photons have been studied for some years and many aspects remain to be explored. In general, these phenomena tend to reduce the differences of radiosensitivity among different tissues. It is therefore in situation where tumours are relatively radioresistant compared to healthy tissue, that carbon ions must be used and not in the opposite situations where the fractionation of low linear energy transfer radiation is sufficient to provide the necessary differential effect to cure the tumour.","1265":"Breast cancer treatment guidelines are based on usual prognostic factors such as size, histological grade, axillar lymph node involvement, expression of hormonal receptors. The intrinsic molecular classification is giving additional information over clinical and pathological features. Predictive models for systemic relapse have been established and are currently under clinical investigation to determine precisely when chemotherapy is needed. This review will look after the implications of this classification in terms of radiobiology: on one hand, we will look if this classification helps for loco-regional relapse prediction and on the other hand, if it is able to change the radiotherapy schedule within the molecular classification.","1266":"To assess the clinical outcome of the involved-node radiotherapy (INRT) concept with the use of deep-inspiration breath-hold (DIBH) technique in patients with localized supra-diaphragmatic Hodgkin lymphoma. All were patients with stage I-II Hodgkin lymphoma and they were treated with chemotherapy prior to irradiation. Radiation treatments were delivered using the involved-node radiotherapy concept according to the European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer Guidelines and a spirometer dedicated to DIBH radiotherapy was used for every patient. Twenty-seven patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (26 patients with primary Hodgkin lymphoma, one with refractory disease), treated from November 2004 to October 2010, were retrospectively analysed. The median age was 27 years (range 16 to 54). Seventeen (63%) patients had stage I-IIA and 10 (37%) had stage I-IIB disease. All patients received two to six cycles of adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine. The median radiation dose to patients was 30,6 Gy (range: 19,8-40). Protection of various organs at risk was satisfactory. Median follow-up, 3-year progression-free and 3-year overall survival were 38 months (range: 7-70), 96% (95%CI: 79-99%) and 95% (95%CI: 75-99%), respectively. Recurrence occurred in one patient (mediastinal in-field relapse). There was one grade 3 acute toxicity (transient pneumonitis).

A 4D-CT scan integrates the motion of the tumour during breathing and, therefore, provides us with important information regarding tumour's motion in all directions, the motion volume (ITV) and the time-weighted average position (MVP). Based on these two concepts, we have estimated, for a lung carcinoma case a 3D dose distribution from a 3D-CT scan, and a 4D dose distribution from a 4-D CT scan. To this, we have applied a non-rigid registration to estimate the cumulative dose. Our study shows that the 4D dose estimation of the GTV is almost the same when made using MVP and ITV concepts, but sparring of the healthy lung is better done using the MPV model (MVP), as compared to the ITV model. This improvement of the therapeutic index allows, from a projection on the theoretical maximal dose to PTV (strictly restricted to doses for the lungs and the spinal cord), for an increase of about 11% on the total dose (maximal dose of 86 Gy for the ITV and 96 Gy for the MVP). Further studies with more patients are needed to confirm our data.

We treated 12 elderly patients with a curative intent. Median age was 78 years (range: 75-90). Ten patients had a stage II or IIIA (UICC 2009) tumour and six out of 12 were N+. Taking into account the age, the Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group (ECOG) performance status and comorbidities, five patients received exclusive radiotherapy (\"RT group\") and seven a concomitant radiochemotherapy (\"RT-CT group\"). All patients received a boost by interstitial brachytherapy. One patient of the \"RT-CT group\" presented rectorragies during brachytherapy. The irradiation was completed by external beam radiotherapy focalized on the tumour volume. Grade 3 acute reactions (Radiation Therapy Oncology Group [RTOG]) were reported in three out of 12 patients. One grade 2-3 leucopoenia was observed in one out of 7 patients (\"RT-CT group\"). After brachytherapy, one grade 3 rectal toxicity (rectorragia) (in \"RT group\") and one grade 4 (in \"RT-CT group\") were observed. One patient (\"RT-CT group\") presented a late grade 3 rectal toxicity (evaluated only for patients with at least 12 months of follow-up). Concomitant radiochemotherapy followed by brachytherapy showed an acceptable toxicity profile, and seems to be adapted in selected elderly patients.

Patients with early-stage supradiaphragmatic Hodgkin lymphoma were treated with chemotherapy prior to irradiation. Radiation treatments were delivered using the involved-node radiotherapy (INRT) concept according to the EORTC guidelines. Intensity modulated radiotherapy was performed free-breathing. Forty-seven patients with Hodgkin lymphoma (44 patients with primary Hodgkin lymphoma and three patients with recurrent disease) entered the study from January 2003 to December 2010. The median age was 31 years (range 17 to 62). Thirty patients had stage I-IIA, 14 had stage I-IIB disease and three had relapse. Forty-two patients received three to six cycles of adriamycin, bleomycin, vinblastine and dacarbazine (ABVD). The median radiation dose to patients was 36 Gy (range: 20-40).

For patients with primary Hodgkin lymphoma, the 5-year survival and 5-year progression-free survival rates were 96% (95% confidence interval: 80-99) and 92% (95% confidence interval: 78-97), respectively. None of the three patients with recurrent disease has relapsed. Recurrences occurred in three patients: one was in-field relapse and two were visceral recurrences.

Ninety patients treated for cervix carcinoma and evaluated initially by MRI and FGD PET were included. The performances of FDG-PET for lymph node detection (relatively to the lymph node dissection) have been described (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value). PET tumour parameters analyzed were: maximum standard uptake value (SUVmax), the volume and the maximum diameter. The prognostic and predictive values of these parameters were investigated. The tumour response was evaluated on surgical specimens. PET detected the cervical tumour with a sensitivity of 97% (mean values: SUVmax=15.8, volume=27 mm(3), maximum diameter=47). For the detection of the lymph nodes, the values of sensibility, specificity, positive predictive value and negative predictive value were: 86, 56, 69 and 78% in the pelvic, and 90, 67, 50 and 95% for the para-aortic area, respectively. The SUVmax was correlated with histologic response (P=0.04). The frequency of partial histological response was significantly higher for tumour SUVmax&gt;10.9 (P=0.017). The maximum PET diameter and pathologic response had an impact on disease-free survival and overall survival in multivariate analysis (P&lt;0.05). PET has high sensitivity in detecting pelvic and para-aortic lymph nodes. Some primary cervical tumour PET parameters are useful as prognostic and predictive factors. ","1273":"Manual delineation of dental structures is too time-consuming to be feasible in routine practice. Information on dose risk levels is crucial for dentists following irradiation of the head and neck to avoid postextraction osteoradionecrosis based on empirical dose-effects data established on bidimensional radiation therapy plans. We present an automatic atlas-based segmentation framework of the dental structures, called Dentalmaps, constructed from a patient image-segmentation database. This framework is accurate (within 2 Gy accuracy) and relevant for the routine use. It has the potential to guide dental care in the context of new irradiation techniques. This tool provides a user-friendly interface for dentists and radiation oncologists in the context of irradiated head and neck cancer patients. It will likely improve the knowledge of dose-effect correlations for dental complications and osteoradionecrosis. ","1274":"In case of tumour displacement, image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) based on the use of cone beam CT (tomographie conique) allows replacing the tumour under the accelerator by rigid registration. Anatomical deformations require however replanning, involving an estimation of the cumulative dose, session after session. This is the objective of this study. Two examples of arc-intensity modulated radiotherapy are presented: a case of prostate cancer (total dose=80 Gy) with tomographie conique (daily prostate registration) and one head and neck cancer (70 Gy). For the head and neck cancer, the patient had a weekly scanner allowing a dose distribution calculation. The cumulative dose was calculated per voxel on the planning CT after deformation of the dose distribution (with trilinear interpolation) following the transformation given by a non-rigid registration step (Demons registration method) from: either the tomographie conique (prostate), or the weekly CT. The cumulative dose was eventually compared with the planned dose. In cases of prostate irradiation, the \"cumulative\" dose corresponded to the planned dose to the prostate. At the last week of irradiation, it was above the planned dose for the rectum and bladder. The volume of rectal wall receiving more than 50 Gy (V50) was 20% at the planning and 26% at the end of treatment, increasing the risk of rectal toxicity (NTCP) of 14%. For the bladder wall, V50 were 73% and 82%, respectively. In head and neck, the \"cumulative\" dose to the parotid exceeded the planned dose (mean dose increasing from 46 Gy to 54 Gy) from the 5th week of irradiation on, suggesting the need for replanning within the first 5 weeks of radiotherapy. The deformable registration estimates the cumulative dose delivered in the different anatomical structures. Validation on digital and physical phantoms is however required before clinical evaluation. ","1275":"Cancer is a multi-etiologic, multistage disease with a prevalent genetic component, which happens when a large number of genes, critical for cell growth, death, differentiation, migration, and metabolic plasticity are altered irreversibly, so as to either \"gain\" (oncogenes) or \"lose\" (tumour suppressors) their function. Recent discoveries have revealed the previously underestimated etiologic importance of multiple epigenetic, that is to say, reversible factors (histone modifications, DNA methylation, non-coding RNA) involved in the transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation of proteins, indispensable for the control of cancerous phenotype. Stable alterations of epigenetic machinery (\"epimutations\") turn out to play a critical role at different steps of carcinogenesis. In addition, due to substantial recent progress in stem cell biology, the new concept of cancer stem cells has emerged. This, along with newly discovered epigenetic cancer mechanisms, gives rise to a hope to overcome radio- and chemo-resistance and to eradicate otherwise incurable neoplasms.","1276":"To assess the benefits of using cardiac gated images for treatment planning of breast and internal mammary nodes. Inspiration breath hold computed tomography (CT) series acquired at prospectively gated diastolic phase were used for planning. Three different techniques were compared. Technique A used tangents and an internal mammary nodes field covering the three first inter-rib spaces; technique B used an extended internal mammary nodes including part of the medial breast in junction with tangential fields; the 3(rd) technique used helical tomotherapy. For each technique, two treatment plans were performed: one plan (plan-01) where mean dose and V(25) to the heart were considered for plan evaluation and a second plan (plan-02) where the irradiation of the left anterior descending artery was minimized. V(25) to the heart was found to be less than 5% for all six plans. Mean doses to the heart were within 4.8 to 7.2 Gy. By attempting to lower the dose to the left anterior descending artery, heart D(mean) was decreased by 20-30% for the two techniques A and B while being unchanged for tomotherapy. Regarding target coverage, there was no marked difference between plans where only heart dose was considered (plans-01) and plans where the left anterior descending artery dose was minimized (plans-02). When the left anterior descending artery dose was part of plan evaluation, D(mean) to the left anterior descending artery could be decreased by 24, 19 and 9% for techniques A, B and tomotherapy respectively. The three techniques exposed segments of the left coronary to different levels of dose. This study showed that evaluation of the dose to the left anterior descending artery coronary may change the treatment strategy. Cardiac gated images without IV contrast permitted a good visualization of the coronaries in order to optimize the dose on these structures. In addition to heart V(25,) the dose to the coronaries should be included in prospective studies on radiotherapy related heart toxicity in association with all additional risk factors. ","1277":"PET imaging is now considered a gold standard tool in clinical oncology, especially for diagnosis purposes. More recent applications such as therapy follow-up or tumor targeting in radiotherapy require a fast, accurate and robust metabolically active tumor volumes delineation on emission images, which cannot be obtained through manual contouring. This clinical need has sprung a large number of methodological developments regarding automatic methods to define tumor volumes on PET images. This paper reviews most of the methodologies that have been recently proposed and discusses their framework and methodological and\/or clinical validation. Perspectives regarding the future work to be done are also suggested.","1278":"Since the implementation of preoperative chemoradiotherapy and mesorectal excision, the 5-year rates of locoregional failures in T3-T4 N0-N1 M0 rectal cancer fell from 25-30% thirty years ago to 5-8% nowadays. A critical analysis of the locoregional failures sites and mechanisms, as well as the identification of nodal extension, helps the radiation oncologist to optimize the radiotherapy target definition. The upper limit of the clinical target volume is usually set at the top of the third sacral vertebra. The lateral pelvic nodes should be included when the tumor is located in the distal part of the rectum. The anal sphincter and the levator muscles should be spared when a conservative surgery is planned. In case of abdominoperineal excision, the ischiorectal fossa and the sphincters should be included in the clinical target volume. A confrontation with radiologist and surgeon is mandatory to improve the definition of the target volumes to be treated.","1279":"Only 60% of patients with early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), a priori bearing a favorable prognosis, undergo radical resection because of the very frequent co-morbidities occurring in smokers, precluding surgery to be safely performed. Stereotactic radiotherapy consists of the use of multiple radiation microbeams, allowing high doses of radiation to be delivered to the tumour (ranging from 7.5 to 20 Gy per fraction) in a small number of fractions (one to eight on average). Several studies with long-term follow-up are now available, showing the effectiveness of stereotactic radiotherapy to control stage I\/II non-small cell lung cancer in medically inoperable patients. Local control rates are consistently reported to be above 95% with a median survival of 34 to 45 months. Because of these excellent results, stereotactic radiation therapy is now being evaluated in operable patients in several randomized trials with a surgical arm. Ultimately, the efficacy of stereotactic radiotherapy in early-stage tumours leads to hypothesize that it may represent an opportunity for locally-advanced tumors. The specific toxicities of stereotactic radiotherapy mostly correspond to radiation-induced chest wall side effects, especially for peripheral tumours. The use of adapted fractionation schemes has made feasible the use of stereotactic radiotherapy to treat proximal tumours. Overall, from a technical concept to the availability of specific treatment devices and the publication of clinical results, stereotactic radiotherapy represents a model of implementation in thoracic oncology.","1280":"The continuous increase of breast cancer (BC) incidence, the logistic constraints of the protracted standard 5-week radiations regimen have led to test short hypofractionated whole breast radiation therapy schemes. Three prospective randomized trials and a pilot trial have been published. Large numbers of patients were included, with follow-up duration ranging from 5 to 12 years. The conclusions of these trials were similar, showing local control and toxicity equivalent to those of the standard regimen, and supporting the use of three schemes: 42.5 Gy\/16 fractions\/3 weeks, 40 Gy\/15 fractions\/3 weeks or 41.6 Gy\/13 fractions\/5 weeks. However, the patients in these trials had favourable prognostic factors, were treated to the breast only and the boost dose, when indicated, was delivered with a standard fractionation. Hypofractionated treatment can only be recommended in patients treated to the breast only, without nodal involvement, with grade&lt;3 tumours and who are not candidate to chemotherapy. If a boost is to be given, a standard fractionation should be used. Particular care should be taken to avoid heterogeneities leading to high fractional doses to organs at risk (lung and heart).","1281":"IMRT is a seducing treatment option in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma mediastinal masses due to the complex form of the tumour masses and their proximity to organs at risk such as the heart and the coronary arteries. This treatment delivery technique remains risky owing to respiratory movements and heart beats. The concomitant use of IMRT and respiratory gating is enticing, but a number of theoretical and practical hurdles remain to be resolved before it can be used in clinical daily practice.","1282":"The radiotherapy of thoracic cancers exposes the heart to late radiation-induced complications. The physiopathological and clinical consequences of heart irradiation have been mostly studied in patients with Hodgkin lymphoma and breast cancer. The main cause of cardiac morbidity is radiation-induced coronaropathy with a relative risk estimated between 2 and 3 in earlier studies. Preexisting factors of cardiovascular risk, including chemotherapy, potentalize the cardiotoxicity of radiotherapy. Conformational radiotherapy, adapting the ballistics and the energy to the delineated volumes while carefully evaluating the dose-volume distribution in the organs at risk, allowed a drastic reduction in cardiac mortality. This toxicity no longer seems to be significant if the cardiac volume has received less than 30 Gy. Nevertheless, the prolonged life expectancy of cancer patients and the expanding use of new cardiotoxic anticancer drugs underline the persistent need to further reduce the dose delivered to the heart. Indeed, 1 Gy added to the mean heart dose would increase the cardiotoxic risk by 4% (IC 95%: 2-6%, P=0.0002). A strengthened collaboration between the radiation oncologist and the cardiologist aims at detecting and treating long-term complications after thoracic radiotherapy.","1283":"Chemotherapy does not increase the survival time of patients treated for rectal cancer. Chemotherapy given concomitantly to radiotherapy and combined before or after radiation significantly reduces the risk of local recurrence. The sterilization of the tumour (complete pathological response) by chemotherapy is a favourable prognostic factor. New trials on optimisation of pathological complete response rates are based on using drugs effective on metastatic colorectal cancer, given prior to chemoradiotherapy and followed by a resection at least 8 weeks after the end of the radiotherapy. The level of evidence for postoperative chemotherapy is low due to lack of specific study. The indication of postoperative chemotherapy depends on the disease extent after preoperative treatment.","1284":"Lung cancer is the leading cause of cancer-related death. Between 80-85% of lung cancers are non-small cell lung carcinomas. One third of the patients are diagnosed with locally advanced stage. In this condition, concomitant radio-chemotherapy is the standard treatment for patients with good performance status. Despite important improvements in the last years, non-small cell lung carcinoma prognosis remains poor, with high rates of both local recurrences and metastases. The heterogeneity of molecular characteristics of non-small cell lung carcinoma cells and a better knowledge of potential targets offer promising developments for new pharmacologic agents. Hereafter we will review the currently most studied pathways and the most promising ones for the treatment of locally advanced unresectable non-small cell lung carcinoma. Two of the most attractive pathways where new agents have been developed and assessed in combination with thoracic radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy are the EGFR pathway (either with the use of monoclonal antibodies or tyrosine kinase inhibitors) and the angiogenesis inhibition. The development of targeted agents could lead to individualized therapeutic combinations taking into account the intrinsic characteristics of tumor cells. Pharmacological modulation of tumour cells radiosensitivity by targeted therapies is only starting, but yet offers promising perspectives.","1285":"The standard treatment for head and neck inoperable squamous cell carcinoma is an association of radiotherapy and platinum. However, only one patient out of three remains alive five years after diagnosis. The interest in induction chemotherapy was renewed by the introduction of taxanes combined with cisplatinum and 5-fluoro-uracile. The triple association taxane-cisplatinum-5-fluoro-uracile yielded improved survival when compared to cisplatinum-5-fluoro-uracile. Wider use of taxane-cisplatinum-5-fluoro-uracile is limited by its toxicity and the lack of randomized comparison with a concomitant chemoradiotherapy scheme including optimal doses of platinum. Until the results of new phase III trials are published, the choice between induction chemotherapy followed by concomitant chemoradiotherapy or concomitant chemoradiotherapy alone has to be made on an individualized basis, taking into account the patient's medical condition, the ability of the medical team to deal with intensive treatment regimens, and the clinical\/pathological characteristics of the tumour.","1286":"The recent advances in medical imaging have profoundly altered the radiotherapy of non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC). A meta-analysis has confirmed the superiority of FDG PET-CT over CT for initial staging. FDG PET-CT improves the reproducibility of target volume delineation, especially close to the mediastinum or in the presence of atelectasia. Although not formally validated by a randomized trial, the reduction of the mediastinal target volume, by restricting the irradiation to FDG-avid nodes, is widely accepted. The optimal method of delineation still remains to be defined. The role of FDG PET-CT in monitoring tumor response during radiotherapy is under investigation, potentially opening the way to adapting the treatment modalities to tumor radiation sensitivity. Other tracers, such as F-miso (hypoxia), are also under clinical investigation. To avoid excessive delays, the integration of PET-CT in routine practice requires quick access to the imaging equipment, technical support (fusion and image processing) and multidisciplinary delineation of target volumes.","1287":"Intensity-modulated conformal radiotherapy (IMRT) is booming as treatment of locally advanced cervical cancer. This technique reduces the doses delivered to organs at risk and, by analogy to the irradiation of prostate cancer, opens the door to the possibility of dose escalation to levels close or similar to those achieved by brachytherapy. To date, several studies comparing IMRT with brachytherapy have been published, often methodologically flawed, concluding sometimes that both techniques are comparable. These results should be taken with extreme caution and should not overshadow the recent advances in brachytherapy with the use of 3D imaging and optimization. Preliminary works also showed that the combination of 3D optimized brachytherapy with IMRT could improve the management of the local disease especially for lesions poorly covered by intracavitary techniques.","1288":"This article describes the determination and the delineation of the target volumes for head-and-neck cancers treated with intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The delineation of the clinical target volumes (CTV) on the computerized tomography scanner (CT scan) requires a rigorous methodology due to the complexity of head-and-neck anatomy. The clinical examination with a sketch of pretreatment tumour extension, the surgical and pathological reports and the adequate images (CT scan, magnetic resonance imaging and fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) are necessary for the delineation. The target volumes depend on the overall strategy: sequential IMRT or simultaneous integrated boost-IMRT (SIB-IMRT). The concept of selectivity of the potential subclinical disease near the primary tumor and the selection of neck nodal targets are described according to the recommendations and the litterature. The planing target volume (PTV), mainly reflecting setup errors (random and systematic), results from a uniform 4-5mm expansion around the CTV. We propose the successive delineation of: (1) the gross volume tumour (GTV); (2) the \"high risk\" CTV1 around the GTV or including the postoperative tumour bed in case of positive margins or nodal extracapsular spread (65-70 Gy in 30-35 fractions); (3) the CTV2 \"intermediate risk\" around the CTV1 for SIB-IMRT (59-63 Gy in 30-35 fractions); (4) the \"low-risk\" CTV3 (54-56 Gy in 30-35 fractions); (5) the PTVs.","1289":"Traditionally, the target volumes of curative-intent radiotherapy for non-small cell lung cancer include all uninvolved mediastinal nodes. However, an improvement in tumour control requires an increase of the total dose to the macroscopic target volume. This is only achievable if the irradiation of the organs at risk is reduced, i.e. elective irradiation of the mediastinum is omitted. The available data suggest that elective mediastinal irradiation may be safely omitted, provided that an adequate staging procedure, including FDG PET-CT, has been performed.","1290":"The use of intraoperative radiation therapy in breast cancer patients started about 20 years ago. Several retrospective and prospective studies have been published. Intraoperative radiation therapy was initially given as a boost to the tumour bed, followed by whole-breast irradiation. These studies have demonstrated the feasibility of the technique, with local control rates and cosmetic results similar to those obtained with standard treatments. Accelerated partial breast irradiation yields local recurrence rates as low as those observed after whole-breast irradiation. Intraoperative radiation therapy as a single irradiation modality with a unique dose has been investigated in recent prospective studies showing satisfactory local results. Intraoperative radiation therapy can be proposed either as a boost or as a unique treatment in selected cases (tumour size, nodal and hormonal status, patient's age). Intraoperative radiation therapy can be delivered by orthovoltage (50 kV) X-rays from mobile generators, or by electrons from linear accelerators, mobile or fixed, dedicated or not to intraoperative radiation therapy.","1291":"Combined radical radiation therapy for head and neck carcinoma should be planned with intensity modulated beams to provide a rapid answer to patients' requirements in terms of quality of treatment. The most frequent late toxicity of radiation therapy is xerostomia, which may be prevented by using this technique able to significantly spare salivary glands irradiation. Selection of indications is a very important step. The objective of sparing salivary functions, strongly associated with optimization criteria of quality of life should be considered as a main objective in irradiation of head and neck tumours. The various possibilities offered by this technique allowing to boost a target volume included in prophylactically irradiated regions could offer the possibility to escalate the dose in selected patients. The feasibility of this process is currently validated in prospective studies. Finally, routine implementation of intensity modulated radiation therapy should be performed with strong and robust quality assurance procedures, ensuring that the expected benefit could be increased with the current developments by using rotational techniques.","1292":"Delineation of glioblastoma is complex. Volumes conventionally defined: gross tumour volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV) overlap and are separated according to imagery used. A review of these provides insight into the problem. If the correlations between imaging abnormalities and pathology seem to be relevant, the impact of their use in terms of local control and survival remains to be demonstrated.","1293":"Anal canal carcinoma are highly curable by irradiation, combined with chemotherapy in locally advanced disease, with preservation of sphincter function. The clinical target volume for the nodes is extended, often including the inguinal nodes, which is not usual for other pelvic tumours. Acute and late effects are correlated with the volume and dose delivered to organs at risk, i. e. small bowel, bladder and increased by concomitant chemotherapy. Intensity modulated irradiation (IMRT) makes it possible to optimize the dose distribution in this \"complex U shaped\" volume, while maintaining the dose distribution for the target volumes. The conversion from conformal irradiation to IMRT necessitates good knowledge of the definition and skills to delineate target volumes and organs at risk, including new volumes needed to optimize the dose distribution. Dosimetric and clinical benefits of IMRT are described, based on early descriptions and evidence-based publication. The growing development of IMRT in anal canal radiotherapy must be encouraged, and long-term benefits should be soon published. Radiation oncologists should precisely learn IMRT recommendations before starting the technique, and evaluate its early and late results for adverse effects, but also for long-term tumour control.","1294":"Patients' follow-up after treatment represents a growing part of the radiation oncologist activity. Treatment effectiveness and morbidity are essential criteria to evaluate the quality of a clinical practice. Morbidity and mortality reviews and feedback experience meetings have been made mandatory. Post-treatment follow-up has to be explicitly and formally organized. In the present article, we review the existing recommendations and consider several examples regarding frequently encountered cancers.","1295":"","1296":"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy generally induces significant changes in the pathological extent of disease and challenges the standard indications of adjuvant postmastectomy radiation therapy. We retrospectively evaluated the impact of postmastectomy radiation therapy in breast cancer patients with negative lymph nodes (pN0) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. Among 1054 breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in our institution between 1990 and 2004, 134 patients had pN0 status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and mastectomy. Demographic data, tumor characteristics, metastatic sites, and treatments were prospectively recorded. The impact of postmastectomy radiation therapy on locoregional recurrence-free survival and overall survival was evaluated by multivariate analysis including known prognostic factors. Among 134 eligible patients, 78 patients (58.2%) received postmastectomy radiation therapy, and 56 patients (41.8%) did not. With a median follow-up time of 91.4 months, the 10-year locoregional recurrence-free survival and overall survival rates were 96.2% and 77.2% with postmastectomy radiation therapy and 86.8% and 87.7% without radiation therapy, respectively (no significant difference). In multivariate analysis, there was a trend towards poorer overall survival among patients who did not have a pathologically complete primary tumour response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (hazard ratio [HR], 6.65; 95% CI, 0.82-54.12; P=0.076). Postmastectomy radiation therapy had no effect on either locoregional recurrence-free survival (HR, 0.37; 95% CI, 0.09-1.61; P=0.18) or overall survival (HR, 2.06; 95% CI, 0.71-6; P=0.18). There was a trend towards poorer overall survival among patients who did not have pathologically complete in-breast tumour response after neoadjuvant chemotherapy (HR, 6.65; 95% CI, 0.82-54.12; P=0.076). This retrospective study showed no increase in the risk of distant metastasis, locoregional recurrence or death when postmastectomy radiation therapy was omitted in breast cancer patients with pN0 status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and mastectomy. Whether the omission of postmastectomy radiation therapy is acceptable for these patients should be addressed prospectively. ","1297":"To assess the benefit of breast surgery for inflammatory breast cancer. This retrospective series was based on 232 patients treated for inflammatory breast cancer. All patients received primary chemotherapy followed by either exclusive radiotherapy (118 patients, 51%) or surgery with or without radiotherapy (114 patients, 49%). The median follow-up was 11 years. The two groups were comparable apart from fewer tumors smaller than 70 mm (43% vs 33%, P=0.003), a higher rate of clinical stage N2 (15% vs 5%, P=0.04) and fewer histopathological grade 3 tumors (46% vs 61%, P&lt;0.05) in the no-surgery group. The addition of surgery was associated with a significant improvement in locoregional disease control (P=0.04) but with no significant difference in overall survival rates or disease-free intervals. Late toxicities were not significantly different between the two treatment groups except for a higher rate of fibrosis in the no-surgery group (P&lt;0.0001), and more lymphedema in the surgery group (P=0.002). Our data suggest an improvement in locoregional control in patients treated by surgery, in conjunction with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, for inflammatory breast cancer. ","1298":"Various subgroups of breast tumours have been identified during the last 10 years according to the risk of local relapse. Prognostic factors for local relapse are age, surgical margins, tumour size, Her2 expression and hormonal receptors status. For tumours with a high risk of local relapse, an increased in boost dose or the addition of new drugs (trastuzumab, antiangiogenics, PARP inhibitors) could be considered. For low risk tumours, hypofractionated, accelerated partial breast and intraoperative radiotherapy are being evaluated. The classical schedule (45-50 Gy to the whole gland followed by a boost dose of 16 Gy) is no longer the universal rule. Treatment individualization, according to clinical and biological characteristics of the tumour and - possibly - to the radiobiological profile of the patient, is likely to be the future of breast cancer radiotherapy.","1299":"Postoperative radiotherapy remains controversial in non-small cell lung cancer. The conclusions of several meta-analysis are still questioned, partly because of flaws in the randomized trials taken into account. The technological improvements of modern radiotherapy and several clinical observations have led to the launch of a new phase III trial.","1300":"Normofractionated radiotherapy is standard for adjuvant management of patients treated with breast conservative surgery for breast cancer. However, many elderly patients are not eligible to such strategy, either because of concurrent diseases, or because the tumor is inoperable. Several protocols of exclusive radiotherapy have been reported in the literature, frequently using hypofractionated radiotherapy and endocrine therapy. We report a case of a patient treated with exclusive endocrine and radiotherapy and address the state of the art on hypofractionated schemes for the management of elderly breast cancer patients. While hypofractionated radiotherapy does not compromise the oncologic or cosmetic outcome, there is no prospective data that assesses the place of radiotherapy for the exclusive treatment of elderly patients. This strategy should be further assessed in clinical randomized trial.","1301":"Surgery is the present reference treatment for stage I non-small cell lung cancer. Lymph node dissection is required for mediastinal staging and discussion of postoperative treatments. In case of limited respiratory function, sub-lobar resection can be considered, either segmentectomy or atypical resection according to the tumour size. For radiological lesions with more than 50% of ground glass opacity, a wedge resection is acceptable if the resection margin is larger than 2 cm of healthy lung.","1302":"Protracted preoperative radiochemotherapy with a 5-FU-based scheme, or a short course of preoperative radiotherapy without chemotherapy, are the standard neoadjuvant treatments for resectable stage II-III rectal cancer. Local failure rates are low and reproducible, between 6 and 15% when followed with a \"Total Mesorectal Excision\". Nevertheless, the therapeutic strategy needs to be improved: distant metastatic recurrence rates remain stable around 30 to 35%, while both sphincter and sexual sequels are still significant. The aim of the present paper was to analyse the ongoing trials listed on the following search engines: the Institut National du Cancer in France, the National Cancer Institute and the National Institute of Health in the United States, and the major cooperative groups. Keywords for the search were: \"rectal cancer\", \"preoperative radiotherapy\", \"phase II-III\", \"preoperative chemotherapy\", \"adjuvant chemotherapy\" and \"surgery\". Twenty-three trials were selected and classified in different groups, each of them addressing a question of strategy: (1) place of adjuvant chemotherapy; (2) optimization of preoperative radiotherapy; (3) evaluation of new radiosensitization protocols and\/or neoadjuvant chemotherapy; (4) optimization of techniques and timing of surgery; (5) place of radiotherapy for non resectable or metastatic tumors.","1303":"The International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU) report No. 83 provides the information necessary to standardize techniques and procedures and to harmonize the prescribing, recording, and reporting of intensity modulated radiation therapy. Applicable concepts and recommendations in previous ICRU reports concerning radiation therapy were adopted, and new concepts were elaborated. In particular, additional recommendations were given on the selection and delineation of the targets volumes and the organs at risk; concepts of dose prescription and dose-volume reporting have also been refined.","1304":"Follow-up after prostate cancer radiotherapy aims at detecting local or metastatic relapse, as well as long-term toxicity, requiring adapted treatments. Several scientific societies have published guidelines including clinical, biological and imaging recommendations. More data suggest a role for aggressive salvage therapy in case of local failure following radiotherapy. An adequate follow-up is required for the sake of patients' safety, i.e. to a posteriori validate dose constraints and radiation technique in each radiotherapy department.","1305":"To assess the value of treatment-planning related parameters namely, the breast volume; the distance of the inferior field border to diaphragm; and the cardiothoracic ratio for left-tangential breast irradiation. Treatment plans of 27 consecutively left-sided breast cancer patients after breast conserving surgery were evaluated for several parameters concerning heart-irradiation. We measured the heart distance respective to the cardiothoracic ratio and the distance of the inferior field border to diaphragm, as well as the breast volume in correlation with the irradiated heart volume. The mean heart and left breast volumes were 504 cm(3) and 672.8 cm(3), respectively. The mean heart diameter was 13.4 cm; the mean cardiothoracic ratio 0.51 and the mean distance of the inferior field border to diaphragm was 1.4 cm. Cardiothoracic ratio (p=0.01), breast volume (p=0.0002), distance of the inferior field border to diaphragm (p=0.02) and central lung distance (p=0.02) were significantly correlated with the measured heart distance. A significant correlation was also found between cardiothoracic ratio, breast volume and distance of the inferior field border to diaphragm with the irradiated heart volume measured by V10, V20 and V40. The verification of parameters like cardiothoracic ratio, distance of the inferior field border to diaphragm and breast volume in left-sided breast cancer patients may help in determining which patients could benefit from more complex planning techniques such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy to reduced risk of late cardiac injury. ","1306":"Early breast cancer incidence increases owing to mammography screening. Hypofractionated radiotherapy is more and more proposed in women with low local relapse risk breast cancer, especially accelerated partial breast irradiation. Various irradiation modalities have been reported: brachytherapy, intraoperative irradiation, 3D-conformal accelerated partial breast irradiation. We describe limitations of intraoperative irradiation and the advantages of alternative techniques.","1307":null,"1308":"To evaluate inter- and intra-observer variability in gross tumor volume definition for adult limb\/trunk soft tissue sarcomas. Imaging studies of 15 patients previously treated with preoperative radiation were used in this study. Five physicians (radiation oncologists, orthopedic surgeons and a musculoskeletal radiologist) were asked to contour each of the 15 tumors on T1-weighted, gadolinium-enhanced magnetic resonance images. These contours were drawn twice by each physician. The volume and center of mass coordinates for each gross tumor volume were extracted and a Boolean analysis was performed to measure the degree of volume overlap. The median standard deviation in gross tumor volumes across observers was 6.1% of the average volume (range: 1.8%-24.9%). There was remarkably little variation in the 3D position of the gross tumor volume center of mass. For the 15 patients, the standard deviation of the 3D distance between centers of mass ranged from 0.06 mm to 1.7 mm (median 0.1mm). Boolean analysis demonstrated that 53% to 90% of the gross tumor volume was common to all observers (median overlap: 79%). The standard deviation in gross tumor volumes on repeat contouring was 4.8% (range: 0.1-14.4%) with a standard deviation change in the position of the center of mass of 0.4mm (range: 0mm-2.6mm) and a median overlap of 93% (range: 73%-98%). Although significant inter-observer differences were seen in gross tumor volume definition of adult soft-tissue sarcoma, the center of mass of these volumes was remarkably consistent. Variations in volume definition did not correlate with tumor size. Radiation oncologists should not hesitate to review their contours with a colleague (surgeon, radiologist or fellow radiation oncologist) to ensure that they are not outliers in sarcoma gross tumor volume definition. Protocols should take into account variations in volume definition when considering tighter clinical target volumes. ","1309":null,"1310":"DNA double strand breaks are major cytotoxic lesions encountered by the cells. They can be induced by ionizing radiation or endogenous stress and can lead to genetic instability. Two mechanisms compete for the repair of DNA double strand breaks: homologous recombination and non-homologous end joining (NHEJ). Homologous recombination requires DNA sequences homology and is initiated by single strand resection. Recently, advances have been made concerning the major steps and proteins involved in resection. NHEJ, in contrast, does not require sequence homology. The existence of a DNA double strand break repair mechanism, independent of KU and ligase IV, the key proteins of the canonical non homologous end joining pathway, has been revealed lately and named alternative non homologous end joining. The hallmarks of this highly mutagenic pathway are deletions at repair junctions and frequent use of distal microhomologies. This mechanism is also initiated by a single strand resection of the break. The aim of this review is firstly to present recent data on single strand resection, and secondly the alternative NHEJ pathway, including a discussion on the fidelity of NHEJ. Based on current knowledge, canonical NHEJ does not appear as an intrinsically mutagenic mechanism, but in contrast, as a conservative one. The structure of broken DNA ends actually dictates the quality repair of the alternative NHEJ and seems the actual responsible for the mutagenesis attributed beforehand to the canonical NHEJ. The existence of this novel DNA double strand breaks repair mechanism needs to be taken into account in the development of radiosensitizing strategies in order to optimise the efficiency of radiotherapy.","1311":"To assess the acute toxicity of intensity modulated radiotherapy as post-operative adjuvant treatment for retroperitoneal sarcoma. Patients who received adjuvant intensity modulated radiotherapy from January 2009 to September 2010 were retrospectively reviewed. Fourteen patients entered the study (seven primary tumours and seven relapses). All tumours were liposarcoma and had macroscopically complete resection, epiploplasty was systematically realized. Median tumour size was 21 cm (range: 15-45), median planning target volume was 580 cm(3) (range: 329-1172) and median prescribed dose was 50.4 Gy (range: 45-54). Median follow-up was 11.5 months (range: 2-21.4). Acute toxicity was mild: acute digestive toxicity grade 1-2 occurred in 12\/14 patients (86%). However, there was no weight loss of more than 5% during radiotherapy and no treatment interruption was required. Two months after completion of radiotherapy, digestive toxicity grade 1 remained present in 1\/14 patients (7%). One case of grade 3 toxicity occurred during follow-up (transient abdominal pain). Three relapses occurred: two were outside treaded volume and one was both in and outside treated volume. Intensity modulated radiotherapy in the postoperative setting of retroperitoneal sarcoma provides low acute toxicity. Longer follow-up is needed to assess late toxicity, especially for bowel, kidney and radio-induced malignancies.

Similar risk factors have been found after external radiation exposure or internal contamination with radioactive iodine isotopes. In case of contamination with radioiodines, administration of potassium iodide can prevent thyroid irradiation.","1313":null,"1314":"At the beginning of the 21st century, radiation biology is at a major turning point in its history. It must meet the expectations of the radiation oncologists, radiologists and the general public, but its purpose remains the same: to understand the molecular, cellular and tissue levels of lethal and carcinogenic effects of ionizing radiation in order to better protect healthy tissues and to develop treatments more effective against tumours. Four major aspects of radiobiology that marked this decade will be discussed: technological developments, the importance of signalling and repair of radiation-induced deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) damage, the impact of individual factor in the response to radiation and the contribution of radiobiology to better choose innovative therapies such as protontherapy or stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). A translational radiobiology should emerge with the help of radiotherapists and radiation physicists and by facilitating access to the new radio and\/or chemotherapy modalities.","1315":null,"1316":null,"1317":"The oncologic outcome and the total dose are highly correlated with the treatment by ionizing radiation. The dose increase (total or per fraction) may provoke late-side effects that are potentially irreversible. The radiation-induced CD8 lymphocyte apoptotic value and the molecular modifications within the lymphocyte are capable of predicting the level of risk of developing late-side effects after curative intent radiotherapy. In this review, we present the different blood assays in this setting and discuss the current possibilities of researches, namely those involving the proteomic process.","1318":null,"1319":null,"1320":"To analyze the therapeutic results of cutaneous cancers on xeroderma pigmentosum through a series of 15 patients treated by radiotherapy. Between 1993 and 2006, 15 patients with xeroderma pigmentosum and having cutaneous cancers were treated in the Radiotherapy Department of university hospital Habib-Bourguiba of Sfax in Tunisia. Seventy-three percent of the cases occurred in male patients and the mean age of appearance of the first tumour was 18.2 years. Tumour histology was squamous cell carcinoma in 74% of the cases. The total number of cutaneous tumours was 84. Ten patients had a surgical resection. Four patients did not respond to chemotherapy. The modality of irradiation was decided according to the size, thickness and localization of the tumour. The dose of radiotherapy was 60Gy or equivalent with classic irradiation. The total number of lesions treated with radiotherapy was 64. Forty-three lesions were treated with contact therapy, ten with brachytherapy and 11 with cobalt therapy. The following acute complications were observed: cutaneous infection (53.3% of patients), radioepithelite (80% of patients) and necroses (33.3% of patients). Evaluation after treatment showed a clinical complete remission in 73% of the cases. Late effects were noted in seven cases: telangiectasy and cutaneous atrophy. A recurrence in the irradiated zone was observed in one case. A nodal metastasis was observed in two cases. Another patient presented lung metastases. After a median follow up of 37.2 months, four patients died, seven are alive with cutaneous cancer and four are alive with complete remission. Radiotherapy is a possible and effective therapeutic alternative. Dose and methods are not defined for xeroderma pigmentosum. ","1321":"We report four cases of non-Hodgkin lymphoma involving the nasopharynx. Clinical, radiological, histological and treatment modalities are described. The four patients were male and aged 20, 42, 71 and 77 years. The symptoms were nasal obstruction with epistaxis in three cases and a cervical node in the fourth case. The histological type was a non-Hodgkin lymphoma of phenotype B with large cells CD20+ in the four cases. The treatment consisted in radiotherapy and chemotherapy.","1322":"Lung cancer remains the leading cause of cancer death. Understanding lung tumours physiopathology should provide opportunity to prevent tumour development or\/and improve their therapeutic management. Cancer stem cell theory refers to a subpopulation of cancer cells also named tumour initiating cells that can drive cancer development. Cells presenting these characteristics have been identified and isolated from lung cancer. Exploring cell markers and signalling pathways specific to lung cancer stem cells may lead to progress in therapy and improve the prognosis of patients with lung cancer. Continuous efforts in developing in vitro and in vivo models may yield reliable tools to better understand cancer stem cell abilities and to test new therapeutic targets. Even if some data are in favour of a higher chemo and radioresistance of cancer stem cells this issue remains disputed. Preclinical data on putative cancer stem cell targets are emerging by now. These preliminary studies are critical for the next generation of lung cancer therapies.","1323":"Systematic verifications of patient's specific intensity-modulated radiation treatments are usually performed with absolute and relative measurements. The results constitute a database which allows the identification of potential systematic errors. We analyzed 1270 beams distributed in 232 treatment plans. Step-and-shoot intensity-modulated radiation treatments were performed with a Clinac (6 and 23 MV) and sliding window intensity-modulated radiation treatments with a Novalis (6 MV). The distributions obtained do not show systematic error and all the control meet specified tolerances. These results allow us to reduce controls specific patients for treatments performed under identical conditions (location, optimization and segmentation parameters of treatment planning system, etc.). ","1324":"After normal tissue exposure to radiation therapy, late side effects can occur and may reduce patients' quality of life due to their progressive nature. Late toxicities occurrence is the main limiting factor of radiotherapy. Various biological disorders related to irradiation are involved in the development of late toxicities including fibrosis. The present review will focus on the recent physiopathological and molecular mechanisms described to be involved in the development of late radio-induced toxicities, that provide therapeutic perspective for pharmacomodulation.","1325":"Non-surgical cancer therapeutic strategies have focused primarily on direct killing of cancer cells by chemotherapy and\/or radiation therapy. However, it is becoming increasingly clear that the efficacy of these therapies can be significantly influenced by the tumor microenvironment. The microenvironment poses both obstacles and opportunities for new therapeutic interventions. New developments in this area are the topic of this review.","1326":"The treatment of patients with endometrial cancer has been extensively modified in recent years. Several randomized studies have redefined the indications for adjuvant therapy in tumours staged 1. In the absence of poor prognostic factors, the management tends to be less aggressive than before, often limited to vaginal brachytherapy. Conversely, for more advanced lesions, for which prognosis is poor, combinations of chemoradiation are currently being evaluated. This literature review aims to provide an update on recent developments in the management of adjuvant radiotherapy for endometrial carcinoma.","1327":"During the annual congress of the SFRO, a symposium, on \"Therapeutic innovations\", described some of the burning questions in the treatment of prostate cancer. What is the best technique to perform radiation dose escalation, brachytherapy or Intensity modulated radiotherapy? Rational has been highlighted for both techniques, but without a prospective comparative trial, no definitive answer could be given today. The role of neo-adjuvant hormonal treatment, before surgery or radiotherapy is still discussed, particularly in the area of LH-RH antagonists which have a rapid and profound anti-hormonal effect. At least, the salvage treatment for biochemical relapse after external beam irradiation has been discussed: surgery, cryotherapy, and High-Intensity focalised ultrasons and the timing of hormonal treatment.","1328":"The 21st SFRO Congress during October 2010 focused on three main topics: prostate, radiotherapy technical innovations (including reirradiation) and quality of life. The pitfalls of IMRT (treatment time, number of monitor unit, low doses) are in competition with arctherapy dynamic techniques that offer reduction treatment time for an equivalent ballistic. These techniques with high dose gradient should be coupled with the better imagery of repositioning (IGRT) to ensure benefice. A prospective evaluation of toxicity, clinical benefit on tumor control but also on quality of life of patients is necessary. In many current and future clinical trials, quality of life related to health will be a relevant outcome measurement to secure the importance of treatment for the patient and the health system.","1329":"Neoadjuvant chemoradiation followed by surgery is the standard of care for locally advanced rectal cancer. The aim of this study was to correlate tumour response to survival and to identify predictive factors for tumour response after chemoradiation. From 1998 to 2008, 168 patients with histologically-proven locally advanced adenocarcinoma treated by preoperative chemoradiation before total mesorectal excision were retrospectively studied. They received a radiation dose of 45 Gy with a concomitant 5-fluoro-uracil-based chemotherapy. Analysis of tumour response was based on the lowering of T stage between pre-treatment endorectal ultrasound and pathologic specimens. Overall and progression-free survival was correlated with tumour response. Tumour response was analysed with predictive factors. The median follow-up was 34 months. Five-year disease-free survival and overall survival were respectively of 44.4% and 74.5% in the whole population, 83.4% and 83.4% in patients with pathological complete response, 38.6% and 71.9% in patients with tumour downstaging, 29.1% and 58.9% in patients with absence of response. A pre-treatment concentration of carcinoembryonnic antigen below 5 ng\/mL was significantly associated with tumour downstaging and significantly independently associated with pathologic complete tumour response (P = 0.019). Downstaging and complete response after chemoradiation improved progression-free survival and overall survival of locally advanced rectal adenocarcinoma. In multivariate analysis, a pre-treatment concentration of carcinoembryonnic antigen below 5 ng\/mL was associated with complete tumour response, hence with tumour downstaging. ","1330":"Over the past two decades, brachytherapy has played an ever expanding role in the definitive radiotherapy of prostate cancer. Brachytherapy surpasses external beam radiotherapy in its ability to deliver intense intraprostatic dose escalation. Although initially low dose rate permanent seed brachytherapy was favored for favorable risk prostate cancers, and high dose rate temporary brachytherapy for intermediate and advanced disease, both types of brachytherapy now have a place across all the risk groups of localized prostate cancer. This article will review indications and patient selection, planning and technical aspects, toxicity and efficacy for both low and high dose rate prostate brachytherapy.","1331":"Recent clinical trials of hypofractionated radiation treatment have provided critical insights into the safety and efficacy of hypofractionation. However, there remains much controversy in the field, both at the level of clinical practice and in our understanding of the underlying radiobiological mechanisms. In this article, we review the clinical literature on hypofractionated radiation treatment for breast, prostate, and other malignancies. We highlight several ongoing clinical trials that compare outcomes of a hypofractionated approach versus those obtained with a conventional approach. Lastly, we outline some of the preclinical and clinical evidence that argue in favor of differential radiobiological mechanisms underlying hypofractionated radiation treatment. Emerging data from the ongoing studies will help to better define and guide the rational use of hypofractionation in future years.","1332":null,"1333":"Positron emission tomography is a functional imaging technique that allows the detection of the regional metabolic rate, and is often coupled with other morphological imaging technique such as computed tomography. The rationale for its use is based on the clearly demonstrated fact that functional changes in tumor processes happen before morphological changes. Its introduction to the clinical practice added a new dimension in conventional imaging techniques. This review presents the current and proposed indications of the use of positron emission\/computed tomography for prostate, bladder and testes, and the potential role of this exam in radiotherapy planning.","1334":"Radiotherapy is an important treatment for prostate cancer. During treatment sessions, bladder and rectal repletion is difficult to quantify and cannot be measured with a single and initial CT scan acquisition. Some methods, such as image-guided radiation therapy and dose-guided radiation therapy, aim to compensate this missing information through periodic CT acquisitions. The aim is to adapt patient's position, beam configuration or prescribed dose for a dosimetric compliance. We evaluated organ motion (and repletion) for 54 patients after having computed the original ballistic on a new CT scan acquisition. A new delineation was done on the prostate, bladder and rectum to determine the new displacements and define organ doses mistakes (equivalent uniform dose, average dose and dose-volume histograms). The new CT acquisitions confirmed that bladder and rectal volumes were not constant during sessions. Some cases showed that previously validated treatment plan became unsuitable. A proposed solution is to correct dosimetries when bladder volume modifications are significant. The result is an improvement for the stability of bladder doses, D50 error is reduced by 25.3%, mean dose error by 5.1% and equivalent uniform dose error by 2.6%. For the rectum this method decreases errors by only 1%. This process can reduce the risk of mismatch between the initial scan and following treatment sessions. For the proposed method, the cone-beam CT is necessary to properly position the isocenter and to quantify bladder and rectal volume variation and deposited doses. The dosimetries are performed in the event that bladder (or rectum) volume modification limits are exceeded. To identify these limits, we have calculated that a tolerance of 10% for the equivalent uniform dose (compared to the initial value of the first dosimetry), this represents 11% of obsolete dosimetries for the bladder, and 4% for the rectum. ","1335":"","1336":"Temozolomide has significantly improved the outcome of patients with glioblastoma. However, the optimal duration of continuation treatment after chemoradiation remains uncertain. This retrospective analysis aims at assessing the feasibility, the tolerance, and the potential benefit of prolonging adjuvant temozolomide more than six months, which is the reference protocol. Forty-six patients were included in the analysis. Median age at diagnosis was 61 years old (range 40 to 77). Forty-five patients received a conformal external beam radiation with concurrent temozolomide-based chemotherapy. Then, 37 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy with temozolomide. The treatment was continued until progression or toxicity. During the adjuvant phase, no treatment discontinuation for toxicity was necessary. Eight patients required dose adaptation because of toxicity. Thirty-two patients presented tumor progression during the adjuvant phase. Overall median survival was 12.3 months (range 11-13.2 months) and progression-free survival (PFS) was 7.6 months (range 5.6-9.6 months). These results suggest feasibility of delivering temozolomide beyond the six months of the standard protocol, with mild toxicity and survival data at least comparable to those from literature. Prospective assessments are ongoing. ","1337":"Ionizing radiation may interfere with electric components of pacemakers or implantable cardioverter-defibrillators. The type, severity and extent of radiation damage to pacemakers, have previously been shown to depend on the total dose and dose rate. Over 300,000 new cancer cases are treated yearly in France, among which 60% are irradiated in the course of their disease. One among 400 of these patients has an implanted pacemaker or defibrillator. The incidence of pacemaker and implanted cardioverter defribillator increases in an ageing population. The oncologic prognosis must be weighted against the cardiologic prognosis in a multidisciplinary and transversal setting. Innovative irradiation techniques and technological sophistications of pacemakers and implantable cardioverter-defibrillators (with the introduction of more radiosensitive complementary metal-oxide-semiconductors since 1970) have potentially changed the tolerance profiles. This review of the literature studied the geometric, dosimetric and radiobiological characteristics of the radiation beams for high energy photons, stereotactic irradiation, protontherapy. Standardized protocols and radiotherapy optimization (particle, treatment fields, energy) are advisable in order to improve patient management during radiotherapy and prolonged monitoring is necessary following radiation therapy. The dose received at the pacemaker\/heart should be calculated. The threshold for the cumulated dose to the pacemaker\/implantable cardioverter-defibrillator (2 to 5 Gy depending on the brand), the necessity to remove\/displace the device based on the dose-volume histogram on dosimetry, as well as the use of lead shielding and magnet are discussed.","1338":"Patients with permanent cardiac pacemakers occasionally require radiotherapy. Therapeutic irradiation may cause pacemakers to malfunction due to the effects of ionizing radiation or electromagnetic interference. We studied the breast cancer patients who needed breast and\/or chest wall and lymph node irradiation to assess the feasibility and tolerance in this population of patients. From November 2008 to December 2009, more than 900 patients received radiotherapy for their breast cancer in our department using megavoltage linear accelerator (X 4-6 MV and electrons). Among them, seven patients were with permanent pacemaker. All patients have been treated to the breast and chest wall and\/or lymph nodes. Total dose to breast and\/or chest wall was 50 Gy\/25 fractions and 46 Gy\/23 fractions to lymph nodes. Patients who underwent conserving surgery followed by breast irradiation were boosted when indicated to tumour bed with 16 Gy\/8 fractions. All patients were monitored everyday in presence of radiation oncologist to follow the function of their pacemaker. All pacemakers were controlled before and after radiotherapy by the patients' cardiologist. Seven patients were referred in our department for postoperative breast cancer radiotherapy. Among them, only one patient was declined for radiotherapy and underwent mastectomy without radiotherapy. In four cases the pacemaker was repositioned before the beginning of radiotherapy. Six patients, aged between 48 and 84 years underwent irradiation for their breast cancer. Four patients were treated with conserving surgery followed by breast radiotherapy and two with mastectomy followed by chest wall and internal mammary chain, supra- and infra-clavicular lymph node irradiation. The dose to the pacemaker generator was kept below 2 Gy. There was no pacemaker dysfunction observed during the radiotherapy. The multidisciplinary work with position change of the pacemaker before radiotherapy and everyday monitoring permitted the safe treatment of our patients. Updated guidelines are definitely needed with more details about acceptable doses at the different parts of the pacemaker. ","1339":"Neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma of the bladder is a rare and aggressive cancer with a very pejorative behavior. Neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma of bladder is a histological entity with special characteristics, rapidly aggressive and metastatic and with a poor prognosis. Because it is rare, there is no consensus to date. Its management should be multidisciplinary, involving surgery, chemotherapy and radiotherapy. We report the case of an 84-year-old patient with neuroendocrine small cell carcinoma of the bladder, treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by a combined chemoradiotherapy. A review of the literature on this topic is also presented.","1340":"A 30-year-old woman, with a history of nasopharyngeal carcinoma, which was treated by radiotherapy nine years previously, presented with occasional diplopia and recent headaches. A nasopharyngeal biopsy showed no recurrence. The imaging revealed a sphenoidal sinus mucocele. Endoscopic marsupialization of the mucocele allowed clinical improvement. A 56-year-old woman presented, five years after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma, with a fronto-orbital mass. CT-scan revealed a fronto-ethmoidal mucocele. Nasopharyngeal biopsy showed tumour recurrence. Marsupialization of mucocele was performed. Recurrence of the carcinoma was treated by radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Sphenoidal sinus mucocele developing after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma has rarely been reported. CT scan and MRI are useful tools in making the diagnosis. Biopsy is required to diagnose recurrence or associated radio-induced tumor. Endoscopic approach gives good results.","1341":"Pure testicular seminoma is a rare disease with an excellent prognosis. Its management is controversial. In stage I disease, several treatment options are considered. Those are radiation therapy alone, chemotherapy alone or active surveillance, which is becoming increasingly popular. For more advanced stages, treatment is based on chemotherapy with or without radiation therapy. In this article, we review thoroughly the existing literature and recent recommendations the various treatment options, their advantages and disadvantages in different stages of the disease.","1342":"","1343":null,"1344":null,"1345":"To compare chemoradiation with systemic chemotherapy to chemotherapy alone in locally advanced pancreatic cancer. One hundred and nineteen patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer, with World Health Organization performance status of zero to two were randomly assigned to either the induction chemoradiation group (60 Gy, 2 Gy\/fraction; concomitant 5-fluoro-uracil infusion, 300 mg\/m(2) per day, days 1-5 for 6 weeks; cisplatin, 20 mg\/m(2) per day, days 1-5 during weeks 1 and 5) or the induction gemcitabine group (GEM: 1000 mg\/m(2) weekly for 7 weeks). Maintenance gemcitabine (1000 mg\/m(2) weekly, 3\/4 weeks) was given in both arms until disease progression or toxicity. Overall survival was shorter in the chemoradiation than in the gemcitabine arm (median survival 8.6 [99% confidence interval 7.1-11.4] and 13 months [8,9,9-18], p=0.03). One-year survival was, respectively, 32 and 53%. These results were confirmed in a per-protocol analysis for patients who received 75% or more of the planned dose of radiotherapy. More overall grades 3-4 toxic effects were recorded in the chemoradiation arm, both during induction (36 versus 22%) and maintenance (32 versus 18%). This intensive induction schedule of chemoradiation was more toxic and less effective than gemcitabine alone. ","1346":"","1347":"To report the results of postoperative radiation therapy in preventing the development of heterotopic bone formation after hip replacement surgery in high-risk patients. Between 1991 and 2007, 44 patients were preventively treated with postoperative RT after total hip replacement. In total, 47 hips were treated. All patients were considered at high risk for developing heterotopic bone formation. Most patients (63.5%) were treated because of a history of severe osteoarthritis or ankylosing spondylitis. All patients were treated with shaped parallel-opposed fields with a single fraction of 7 Gy using 6 or 18 MV photons. Most patients (94%) received radiation therapy within 72 hours postoperative and in only three patients radiation therapy was delivered after 72 hours post-surgery (5-8 days). Minimum follow-up was 1 year. There were 18 females and 26 males. Median age was 63 years (range: 18-80). Treatments were well tolerated and no acute toxicity was seen post-radiation therapy. Only one of the 47 hips (2%) developed heterotopic bone formation. This patient received postoperative radiation therapy to both hips but only developed heterotopic bone formation in one of them. None of the three patients treated beyond 72 hours failed. To date no late toxicity has been observed. The use of postoperative radiation therapy was an effective and safe treatment in the prevention of heterotopic bone formation in a high-risk group of patients undergoing total hip replacement. ","1348":"Several radiological techniques have been used for treating hepatocellular carcinoma. These include transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE) and percutaneous therapy, such as radiofrequency (RF). The treatment efficacy of radiofrequency for hepatocellular carcinoma has been confirmed by several randomized and non randomized studies, with a benefit in terms of morbidity comparatively to surgery when cirrhosis is present. Radiofrequency ablation treatment is based on tumour size, shape and location, with a defined strategy and a proper patient selection. We will also review indications and technical aspects of transcatheter arterial chemoembolization (TACE). It is an accepted worldwide and effective treatment for patients with unresectable large or multinodular hepatocellular carcinoma. It improves significantly survival for adequate selected patients with preservation of liver function.","1349":"To report the epidemiological, clinical aspects and therapeutic results of intracranial ependymomas in Morocco. Our retrospective study concerned 16 cases of intracranial ependymomas, treated from January 1995 to December 2002 at the radiotherapy department of Ibn Rochd Hospital of Casablanca, Morocco. The average age was 15 years and complete surgery was possible in two cases. All the patients received cranial radiotherapy, combined with chemotherapy in six cases. Overall survival and progression-free survival at 5 years were respectively 50% and 31%. Eleven patients had local recurrence after an average period of 21 months. Progression-free survival at 5 years was better if complete resection: 100% vs. 28.6% in cases of incomplete resection, and depending on the histological type with 50% for classic ependymomas and 16.6% for anaplastic. Ependymomas are rare tumors and complete resection is the standard treatment followed by postoperative radiotherapy. The place of chemotherapy remains to be defined. ","1350":"The aim of diagnosis imaging is to detect hepatocellular carcinoma at an early stage, when a curative treatment is available. Biopsy is no longer required prior to treatment, and diagnosis of hepatocellular carcinoma is heavily dependent of imaging characteristics. Therefore, the purpose of this article is to describe the typical features of small (&lt;20mm) and larger hepatocellular carcinomas with noninvasive diagnostic criteria, including ultrasound, computed tomography and MRI. Advances in these imaging modalities have greatly improved the detection of small hepatic nodules on liver cirrhosis, including the different steps of carcinogenesis, from regenerative to dysplastic nodules, and we emphasize the difficulties of radiological differentiation of precancerous lesions and small hepatocellular carcinomas.","1351":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the main type of primary liver cancers and the third most common cause of cancer mortality worldwide. In France, rising number between 5000 and 6000 cases are diagnosed each year. The major risk factor for hepatocellular carcinoma is chronic hepatitis: viral hepatitis B, viral hepatitis C, consumption of alcohol, hemochromatosis. Hepatocellular carcinoma is closely associated to liver cirrhosis, which is a true precancerous state. Because hepatocarcinogenesis is a long and heterogeneous process, there is still much to understand. Many genetic and epigenetic alterations are described leading to changes in cellular signalling cascades involved in regulation of growth, differentiation, apoptosis, motility. Hepatitis viruses play a direct oncogenic role through the interaction between viral and cellular proteins, which control cell homeostasis, or by the integration of hepatitis B virus genome into the host genome. Furthermore, hepatitis viruses play an indirect oncogenic role by causing chronic inflammation and hepatocyte regeneration related to viral hepatopathy. In expectation of a better understanding of hepatocarcinogenesis and new treatments, prevention from risk factors and ultrasonographic screening of patients with cirrhosis should increase prognosis.","1352":"Recent technological advances allow precise and safe radiation delivery in hepatocellular carcinoma. Stereotactic body radiotherapy is a conformal external beam radiation technique that uses a small number of relatively large fractions to deliver potent doses of radiation therapy to extracranial sites. It requires stringent breathing motion control and image guidance. Selective internal radiotherapy or radioembolization refers to the injection of radioisotopes, usually delivered to liver tumors via the hepatic artery. Clinical results for both treatments show that excellent local control is possible with acceptable toxicity. Most appropriate patient populations and when which type of radiation therapy should be best employed in the vast therapeutic armamentarium of hepatocellular carcinoma are still to be clarified.","1353":"Conformal radiotherapy is a promising therapeutic strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), producing local control rates above 90% within the radiation beam. However, survival after radiotherapy remains limited by the high frequency of intra- and extra-hepatic recurrences, which occurs in 40-50 and 20-30% of cases, respectively. Sorafenib (BAY43-9006, Nexavar; Bayer, West Haven, CT) is a small-molecule inhibitor that demonstrated potent activity to target v-raf murine sarcoma oncogene homolog B1 (BRAF) and VEGFR tyrosine kinases. Sorafenib is the only drug that demonstrated effectiveness to increase overall survival in advanced or metastatic hepatocellular carcinoma. The rationale to combine radiotherapy with sorafenib is the following: (1) targeting RAS-RAF-MAPK and VEGFR signaling pathways, which are specifically activated after exposure to radiation, and responsible for radio-resistance phenomenon; (2) enhancing the oxygen effect through normalization of the surviving tumor vasculature; and (3) synchronization of the cell cycle. Sorafenib and radiotherapy represent complementary strategies, as radiotherapy may be useful to prolong the effect of sorafenib through control of the macroscopic disease, when sorafenib may target latent microscopic disease. Sorafenib and radiotherapy associations are thus based on a relevant biological and clinical rationale and are being evaluated in ongoing phase I-II trials.","1354":"To evaluate the role of 4D-CT scan and the breath-related margins in the definition of internal target volume (ITV) during radiotherapy for hepatocellular carcinoma. All patients treated for hepatocellular carcinoma that underwent a 4D-CT simulation scan were retrospectively analysed in order to assess breath-related movements of GTV in the 3-D directions. After a standard CT-scan simulation performed to contour GTV and organs at risk (OARs), a 4D-scan simulation was then realized in order to contour ITV. Margins to be added for every patient to pass from GTV to ITV were calculated and evaluated also regarding liver lobe and GTV size (&lt; or&gt;5 cm). Twenty-seven hepatocellular carcinoma patients were evaluated (total: 28 lesions). Median tumor movements in the craniocaudal, lateral and anteroposterior direction were 8.6mm (range: 0-72.9 mm), 6.5mm (range: 1-68.1mm) and 9.1mm (range: 1-34 mm), respectively. ITV had a median volume increase of 94% (range: 8-403%). Tumour breath-related displacements are significant. 4D-CT simulation scan allows to precisely define these displacements and to tailor the treatment. A precise evaluation of breath-related effects on GTV is essential, particularly with new conformal radiotherapy techniques as intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) and\/or stereotactic body radiotherapy. ","1355":"The present study aimed at analyzing if patient participation constitutes a promising way of improvement of patient safety, or not. The hypothesis is that patient participation is a means to develop a safety culture based on the cooperation between patients and healthcare providers, to improve patients' satisfaction and to reduce the costs associated to adverse events. A half-day session was organized on this theme during a training of radiotherapy professionals on risk management. Professionals were first distributed in three subgroups according to their specialty (radiation oncologists, radiation physicists and medical technicians), and had to work on four main questions relating to participation, among which the collection of real situations in which patients effectively contributed (positively or negatively) to patient safety. Results were then collectively discussed. Patient participation allows not only to detect and recover some mistakes or errors made by the professionals (error of identity), but also to decrease patients' risk behaviors (purposely taking the place of another patient in order to be treated faster). However, it must be seen as a possibility offered to patients, and not as an obligation. Patient participation to patient safety is a field of study, which requires to be developed in order to define the conditions enhancing such participation and to implement a set of actions to improve healthcare safety by a cooperative management of this one. ","1356":"This study aimed at analyzing the evolution and type of recurrence in patients treated for stage I endometrial carcinomas, in order to define the respective roles of adjuvant radiotherapy and brachytherapy. This monocentric retrospective study was conducted at Centre Alexis-Vautrin, Nancy, France, between January 1995 and December 2000 on all the patients surgically treated for an endometrial cancer, and then treated with high dose rate vaginal brachytherapy. The brachytherapy was delivered in two or three fractions of 7 Gy at 5 mm from the applicator. In the good prognosis group, the specific and overall survivals at 5 years were respectively 96.5 and 94.2% with no local recurrence demonstrated. In the intermediate prognostic group, the specific and overall survivals at 5 years were respectively 88 and 85%, with six locoregional recurrences observed among those who did not undergo lymphadenectomy; the overall survival at 5 years was significantly decreased in the absence of external radiation. In the group of poor prognosis (stages II and III), the specific survival at 5 years was respectively 72.8 and 67 %, and the overall survival at 5 years 66.7 and 56.4%. Results for local control and survival as well as for tolerance were good. So we have decided to deliver high rate brachytherapy for all intermediate or poor prognosis patients and we have abandoned pelvic radiotherapy for good prognosis tumours (stages IA: no myometrium invasion with grade 3 and &gt;50% of myometrium invasion with grades 1 and 2), whatever the lymph nodes surgery they had. We now propose pelvic radiotherapy only for intermediate prognosis tumours (such as IA&gt;50% of myometrium invasion with grade 3 and IB stages), if patients did not have any lymphatic surgery, or for bad prognosis tumours. ","1357":"Medical therapies for hepatocellular carcinoma are limited. Standard antimitotic chemotherapies and hormonotherapies are inefficient. Only sorafenib, an antiangiogenic agent inhibiting the VEGF and PDGF receptors as well as MAP kinase pathway, has shown a significant benefit on patient survival. However, its indication is restricted to patients with multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma not responding to transarterial hepatic chemoembolization or patients with hepatocellular carcinoma invading the venous portal tract or spreading to lymph nodes or as distant visceral metastasis.","1358":"For a long time radiotherapy has been excluded from the therapeutic strategy for hepatocellular carcinoma, given its significant toxicity on the non-tumoral liver parenchyma. Conformal radiation is a recent advance in the field of radiotherapy, allowing dose escalation and combination with other therapeutic options for hepatocellular carcinoma, including trans-arterial chemo-embolization. Conformal radiotherapy is associated with interesting features, especially in cirrhotic patients: wide availability, non-invasiveness, possibility to target multiple localizations anywhere within the liver parenchyma, and favorable tolerance profile even in patients with cirrhosis and\/or in a poor medical condition. Recently, radiation delivery has been optimized through several technical developments: respiratory gating and intensity-modulated radiotherapy, which allow a better focalization of the ballistics, stereotactic techniques and proton-beam radiotherapy, whose availability is currently limited in Europe. Given the high response rates of hepatocellular carcinoma to radiation, conformal radiotherapy may be regarded as a curative-intent treatment for hepatocellular carcinoma, similar to surgery and per-cutaneous techniques. Yet the impact of radiotherapy has to be evaluated in randomized trials to better integrate in the complex therapeutic algorithm of hepatocellular carcinoma.","1359":"Hepatocellular carcinoma is a poor prognosis tumour. The potential curative therapeutic options are orthotopic liver transplantation, surgical resection and radiofrequency ablation. Unfortunately, only a minority of patients (around 20%) are eligible for these techniques. Thus, patients can benefit from palliative options, such as transarterial chemoembolization (TACE) or sorafenib that bring only modest benefit on survival. Conformal radiotherapy allows delivering high dose radiation within a precise tumour volume while sparing the surrounding liver parenchyma. As employed in monotherapy, conformal radiotherapy is highly efficient for small size hepatocellular carcinoma (&lt;5 cm). Above 5 cm, its efficacy is more limited but its association with TACE gives spectacular rates of complete responses. Controlled phase 2 or 3 trials are urgently warranted to define its indications in the therapeutic algorithm of hepatocellular carcinoma.","1360":null,"1361":"New perspectives for radiosensitization in hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) have emerged with the increasing knowledge of mechanisms involved in liver oncogenesis. As a matter of fact, some of these mechanisms have also a role in the response to ionizing radiation.

However, there are few preclinical data on concurrent targeted therapies and ionizing radiation in hepatocellular carcinoma models. Preliminary studies are ongoing. Their results might help to better define the potential benefit of such radiosensitizing strategies in the management of hepatocellular carcinoma.","1362":"Hepatocellular carcinoma is now a major public health concern. In intermediate stages (one third of hepatocellular carcinoma patients), chemoembolization is the standard of care despite a poor tolerance and a moderate efficacy. Moreover, despite recent improvements, this technique seems in a dead end. Radioembolization could be an excellent tool for such patients. Currently (131)I-Lipiodol, (188)Re-Lipiodol, (90)Y-glass or resin microspheres are available. More recent and promising data come from microspheres, but phase II and III studies are needed before drawing any conclusion. In the future, the combination of radioembolization with systemic chemotherapy or targeted agents (particularly antiangiogenic drugs) seems very promising.","1363":"Liver metastases are frequently found in oncologic patients. Chemotherapy is the standard treatment in plurimetastatic patients, with the possibility to obtain a clear improvement of their prognosis. Local treatment (surgery, radiofrequency, cryotherapy, radiotherapy, etc.) could be proposed for oligometastatic patients, particularly for those with a good prognosis. Historically, radiation therapy has had a limited role in the treatment of liver metastases because of its toxicity when whole liver irradiation was delivered. Improvements in the knowledge of liver radiobiology and radiopathology as well as technical innovations in delivering radiation therapy are the basis of the modern partial liver irradiation concept. In this historical and therapeutic landscape, extracranial stereotactic radiation therapy is particularly interesting for the treatment of liver metastases. This review summarises published data on stereotactic radiotherapy for the treatment of liver metastases.","1364":"Radiofrequency ablation, partial or total hepatectomy represent curative treatment options for patients suffering from hepatocellular carcinoma in 2010. In this review article, the role (indication, limits, results) of hepatic resection and liver transplantation are discussed.","1365":"Currently, radical mastectomy represents the gold standard for ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence. However, we already showed that a second conservative treatment was feasible combining lumpectomy plus low-dose rate interstitial brachytherapy. In this study, we reported the preliminary results of a second conservative treatment using a high-dose rate brachytherapy. From June 2005 to July 2009, 42 patients presenting with an ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence underwent a second conservative treatment. Plastic tubes were implanted intra-operatively at the time of the lumpectomy. After a post-implant CT scan, a total dose of 34 Gy in 10 fractions over 5 consecutive days was delivered through an ambulatory procedure. The toxicity evaluation used the Common Terminology Criteria for Adverse Events v3.0. The median follow-up was 21 months (6-50 months), median age at the time of the local recurrence was 65 years (30-85 years). The median delay between the primary and the recurrence was 11 years (1-35 years). The location of the recurrence was in the tumor bed for 22 patients (52.4%), in the same quadrant for 14 patients (33.3%) and unknown for six patients (14.3%). The median tumor size of the recurrence was 12 mm (2-30 mm). The median number of plastic tubes and plans were nine (5-12) and two (1-3) respectively. The median CTV was 68 cm(3) (31.2-146 cm(3)). The rate of second local control was 97%. Twenty-two patients (60%) experienced complications. The most frequent side effect consisted in cutaneous and sub-cutaneous fibrosis (72% of all the observed complications). A second conservative treatment for ipsilateral breast cancer recurrence using high-dose rate brachytherapy appears feasible leading to encouraging results in terms of second local control with an acceptable toxicity. Considering that a non-inferiority randomized trial comparing mastectomy versus second conservative treatment could be difficult to perform, what proof level will be necessary to achieve in order to change the medical procedures?

At the time of diagnosis, an efficient carcinologic surgery will not be possible for nearly 80% of patients, in relation to loco-regional extension or metastatic dissemination. After surgical resection, the median survival of resected patients ranges from 12 to 20 months, with a high rate of relapses. Currently, the use of radiotherapy for patients with pancreatic cancer is controversial. In adjuvant setting, the standard treatment is six months of chemotherapy with FUFOL or gemcitabine. Chemoradiation (CRT) may improve the survival of patients with incompletely resected tumors (R1). This must be validated in a prospective trial. Neoadjuvant CRT is a promising treatment but always under evaluation. For the treatment of patients with locally advanced tumors, there is not a standart treatment. A strategy of initial chemotherapy followed by CRT for non progressive patients is under evaluation. Whereas in the first trials of CRT large fields were used, the current trend is to reduce the treated volumes to improve tolerance. The delineation of target volumes has been improved by the use of simulation CT. The aims of this work are to precise the radio-anatomical particularities, the pattern of spread of pancreatic cancer and the principles of 3D conformal radiotherapy illustrated with a clinical case.","1369":"Radiochemotherapy Gatrointestinal intergroup study have demonstrated a convincing local control and overall survival benefit. Oncologists and GI workshops have in the present not had a major interest in the radiotherapy treatment of gastric cancer due to a number of factors. Primary because toxicities may be severe, second physicians may have low experience in definition of clinical target volume and in third perioperative chemotherapy is widely used in this indication. In Summary this issue should be used as guides for defining appropriate radiation planning treatment for the adjuvant postoperative therapy of gastric cancer.","1370":"Esophageal cancers are highly malignant tumours with often a poor prognostic, except for minimal lesions treated with surgery. Radiation therapy, or combined radiation and chemotherapy is the most used therapeutic modality, alone or before oesophagectomy. The delineation of target volumes is now more accurate owing the possibility to use routinely the new imaging techniques (mainly PET). The aim of this work is to precise the radio-anatomical particularities, the pattern of spread of esophageal cancer and the principles of 3D conformal radiotherapy illustrated with a clinical case.","1371":"The objective was the drafting of a document describing the technique of tridimensional conformal irradiation of a non small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Principles and recommendations concern patients affected by lung cancer localized in the thorax and inoperable or patients who must undergo postoperative irradiation. They have been developed according to the current scientific data from an analysis of the literature and professional agreements. Principles and recommendations describe : the centering and the contouring of tumor volumes and organs at risk, the calculation of the dose distribution, the treatment and the surveillance during the treatment.","1372":"One drawback of the growth in conformal radiotherapy and image-guided radiotherapy is the increased time needed to define the volumes of interest. This also results in inter- and intra-observer variability. However, developments in computing and image processing have enabled these tasks to be partially or totally automated. This article will provide a detailed description of the main principles of image segmentation in radiotherapy, its applications and the most recent results in a clinical context.","1373":"Cancers of the paranasal sinuses are rare tumors, with treatment based on a multidisciplinary approach. Surgery and radiation therapy, possibly associated with chemotherapy are used to obtain 5 years specific survival rate of 60-70 %. Advances in radiotherapy, including the use of imaging for 3D conformal approach require precise knowledge of the radioanatomy for this type of tumor to determine the different volumes of interest. Purpose of this study was to specify radioanatomy and conformal radiation modalities for cancers of the sinuses, and is illustrated by a case report.","1374":"This article reviews the concept of selectivity in peritumoral microscopic disease to be included in the Clinical Target Volume (CTV) for elective treatment for larynx and hypopharynx squamous cell carcinoma (50 Gy or 54-60 Gy for SIB-IMRT), using the local tumoral spread. The objective of the present article is to present the different delineations of the target volumes, required for an appropriate application of 3-DCRT and IMRT (supraglottic larynx, vocal cord, subglottic larynx, pyriform sinus, lateral and posterior pharyngeal wall and postcricoid pharynx). These propositions are for the delineation of microscopic peritumoral target volumes when external beam irradiation is required. CTVs are illustrated on CT sections.","1375":"Cancers of the oropharynx are common lesions. Their treatment often includes radiation therapy either exclusively or in combination with chemotherapy or after surgery. The definition of target volumes is made difficult by the complex anatomy of this area.

NHLs constitute a heterogeneous group of lymphoproliferative diseases, including entities with very different epidemiological and evolutive characteristics, as well as prognosis and treatments. Several classifications exist, but in practice, we individualize aggressive NHL including Diffuse Large B-Cell Lymphomas (DLBCL) which is the most common lymphoma, and indolent NHL including follicular lymphomas and mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphomas. The role of the radiotherapy in the management of NHLs varies according to the specific sub-type of lymphoma, but it has become increasingly limited over time. Overall it finds indications with curative intent only in situations of localized LMNH: either associated with chemotherapy as part of a combined modality therapy as for the treatment of localized DLBCL, or as exclusive treatment specially in the rare situations of localized follicular lymphomas. Moreover, lymphocytes being extremely radiosensitive cells, radiotherapy retains excellent indications with palliative intent for the management of symptomatic bulky tumor masses, and that whatever the sub-type of NHLs may be. It is important to remember that even today the \"Involved Field\" irradiation type remains the gold standard for the treatment of nodal NHLs, even if we witness at present the emergence of new types of irradiation, which aim to reduce the amount of irradiated tissues to try to limit the risks of delayed radio-induced complications. The purpose of this article is to clarify the specific aspects (epidemiological, radio-anatomical and prognostic characteristics) of each NHLs'sub-types (except primary central nervous system lymphomas), as well as the practical modalities of the irradiation (illustrated by a clinical case record) when an indication of radiotherapy is placed for their treatment.","1378":"3-D conformal radiotherapy is based on accurate target volumes delineation. Radio-anatomy knowledge's are useful but sometimes difficult to obtain. Moreover, the sources of recommendations for volume definition are disparate. We thus developed a free radio-anatomy website dedicated to volumes delineation for radiation-oncologists (www.siriade.org). This website is a search engine allowing to access to delineation characteristics of main tumours illustrated with clinical cases. It does not aim to provide guidelines. Its main purpose is to provide an iconographic training support with frequent updatings. We present the features of this website and one year connexion statistics.","1379":"With approximately 1500 cases per year in France, Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) represents only 10 to 15 % of new cases of lymphomas, and 0.5 to 1 % of new cases of cancers. The management of this lymphoproliferative disease has undergone profound conceptual changes over time, allowing at present to obtain a cure rate of 75 to 80 % of all confused stage, and up to 90 % in case of early stage HL. If initial treatment consisted in an exclusive extensive (total or sub-total lymphoid) irradiation whatever the stage may be, the place of radiotherapy in the management of HL has evolved over time but remains today one of the cornerstones of the treatment. It becomes integrated within the framework of combined modality therapies associating chemotherapy then irradiation for the early stage HL, and stays a therapeutic alternative in all situations (in advanced stage and\\or recurrent disease) which raises the issue of increasing the locoregional tumor control. Despite the undeniable contribution of radiotherapy in controlling the disease, delayed side effects of treatments are not negligible. So the long-term monitoring of treated patients is essential, mainly because of an increased risk of morbi-mortality due to cardiovascular events and\/or secondary cancers. It is important to remember that even today the \"Involved Field\" irradiation type remains the gold standard, even if we witness at present the emergence of new types of irradiation, which aim to reduce the amount of irradiated tissues to try to limit the risks of delayed radio-induced complications.

Radical treatment of localized invasive tumor is based on cystectomy. Surgical mutilation could be important when Bricker's urinary derivation is performed. Moreover, delayed metastasis frequently appeared in spite of radical surgery. Thus, chemoradiotherapy is a valid alternative treatment to cystectomy for selected patients. Cisplatin or derivatives are usually concurrently administered to radiation therapy up to 60 - 65 Gy. Patients undergo control cystoscopy at midtime of treatment in order to select responders from non responders. For majority of cases, the empty bladder should be entirely treated with added margins (about 20 mm) to build the PTV. Control assessment could be improved by echography, cone beam imaging as well as bladder fiduciaries implantation before treatment. From a case report, this review summarizes the technical aspects of radiation therapy (GTV, CTV and PTV, organs at risk, planning) and main acute and late related toxicities.","1381":"Testicular cancer is rare, representing only 1 % of malignant tumors, but the most common cancer in young men, 15 to 35 years. Adjuvant radiotherapy after orchidectomy in testicular seminoma stage I, reduces risk of relapse. It aims to eradicate micro-metastatic disease in lymph drainage territories. In the case of adjuvant radiotherapy, the relapse-free survival of 96 % with an overall survival of 98 % at 5 years. The irradiation volume is made up of lymph nodes paraaortic which it is possible to add the ipsilateral renal hilum to the testicular lesion. The current recommended dose is 20 Gy in 10 fractions and 2 weeks, usually delivered by two antero-posterior beams. The acute toxicities, mainly represented by nausea and diarrhea are usually quickly resolved to the end of irradiation. Regarding toxicities long-term, preservation of semen should be considered after surgery because of fear of infertility post-treatment. The risk of second cancer associated with exposure to ionizing radiation, albeit small, is especially important to consider these patients to significant life expectancy. Nevertheless, developments in radiotherapy techniques and lower doses and irradiated volumes can probably reduce this risk further.","1382":"More than one third of patients with localized prostate cancer at diagnosis who receive radical prostatectomy have histologically extraprostatic disease. Three randomized trials have demonstrated a significant benefit of postoperative radiotherapy for these patients in terms of biochemical progression-free survival, overall survival or metastasis-free survival in function of each study, at the cost of moderate acute and late toxicity. The technical developments of recent years have enabled the evolution of a three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, with better adaptation of the dose distribution to the shape of target volumes to preserve organs at risk while delivering the required dose volume target. This requires a thorough knowledge of the prostate cancer radioanatomy, ballistics and dosimetry. Purpose of this work was to specify epidemiological and radioanatomy characteristics for this tumor type and conformal radiation modalities illustrated by a case report.","1383":"Radiation therapy is now widely accepted as an efficacious treatment of localized prostate cancer. The technical developments of recent years have enabled the evolution of a three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, offering a better adaptation of the dose distribution, and leading therefore to preserve organs at risk. In addition, the required dose delivered to the target volume permit physician to increase the total dose if necessary. This requires a thorough knowledge of the radio-anatomy of the prostate, the natural history of the disease but also the ballistics and dosimetry. The objectives of this work were to detail epidemiology and radio-anatomy of the prostate cancer.

They are mostly diagnosed at an early stage with an excellent prognosis. Surgery is the reference for a precise FIGO staging who guide adjuvant treatment. Tumor extension, grade, myometrium invasion and involved lymph nodes will be discriminating in therapeutic strategy. The management of stages I and II has been recently amended by ESMO, who proposed surveillance, brachytherapy, and radiation therapy followed by brachytherapy for respectively low, intermediate and high risk groups. These recommendations are controversial and must be confirmed. Locally advanced stages represent a heterogeneous population in which surgery should be proposed if it is feasible then followed by radiotherapy and\/or chemotherapy. Based on an illustrated clinical case, indications, delineation, dosimetry and complications expected with radiotherapy are demonstrated.","1385":"Cervix cancers declined in most developed countries in recent years, but remain, the third worldwide leading cause of cancer death in women. A precise staging, based on clinical exam, an abdominal and pelvic MRI, a possible PET-CT and a possible lymph node sampling is necessary to adapt the best therapeutic strategy. In France, the treatments of tumors of less than 4 cm without nodal involvement are often based on radiotherapy followed by surgery and, whereas tumors larger than 4 cm and involved nodes are treated with concurrent chemoradiotherapy. Based on an illustrated clinical case, indications, delineation, dosimetry and complications expected with radiotherapy are demonstrated.","1386":"Glial tumors represent 2000 to 3000 new cases per year in France and 75% of them are of high grade. Recent understanding of the molecular biology of these tumors revealed the importance of 1p19q codeletion and mgMT promotor methylation. Radiotherapy also recently evolved with the progress in medical imaging which allows a better definition of the target volumes. Even modest, therapeutic progress is based on chemoradiotherapy with temozolomide and on the development of non-coplanar conformational radiotherapy. Knowledge and precise evaluation of potential late effects of our treatments is necessary due to actual improvement of survival with chemoradiotherapy in glioblastoma.","1387":"Breast cancer is the most frequent cancer of women in western countries. There are one million new cases per year in the world which represents 22% of all female cancers, and more than 370,000 deaths due to breast cancer per year (14% of cancer mortality). More than half of breast cancers are associated with axillary nodal involvement. Post-operative radiation therapy (XRT) is a crucial part of locoregional treatment in axillary nodal involvement breast cancer owing to a 15-years risk reduction of locoregional recurrence of 70% and to a 5.4% risk reduction of specific mortality. In 3D-conformal irradiation in such breast cancers, target volumes are chest wall when mastectomy was performed or breast and boost of tumor bed in case of breast conservative surgery, and supra-clavicular and\/or axillary and\/or internal mammary node areas. The main organs at risk are ipsilateral lung, heart and brachial plexus. The aim of this article is to describe epidemiologic, radio anatomic and prognostic features of axillary nodal involvement breast cancer and to propose guidelines for 3D-conformal treatment planning in locally advanced breast cancers. This review is illustrated by a case report.","1388":"Breast cancer is the most common cancer in women. In France, breast cancer incidence was 88.9 per 100,000 women in 2000. Early detection of breast tumours by screening mammography allows a breast conserving treatment, i.e., breast irradiation preceded by a lumpectomy and a sentinel node biopsy. The standard irradiation of early breast cancers consists in delivering 50 Gy to the whole breast in 2 Gy fractions over a five-week period followed by an additional dose targeting the tumour bed of 16 Gy in eight fractions. The 3D-conformal treatment planning optimizes dose distribution to the whole breast and to the tumour bed and lessens the normal tissue irradiation (heart and ipsilateral lung). The aim of this article is to describe epidemiologic, radio anatomic and prognostic features of early stage breast cancer and to propose guidelines for 3D-conformal treatment planning in early breast cancers. This review is illustrated by a case report.","1389":"Anal canal epidermoid carcinomas represent 1.2% of digestive cancers and 6% of ano-rectal cancers. For localized diseases, the treatment is based on radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy (5-FU and cisplatin or mitomycin), according to tumour and nodal extension. The recommended treatment dose is 45 Gy in the anal canal, the mesorectum, pararectal lymph nodes, and inguinal lymph nodes. An additional dose of 15 to 20 Gy is delivered in the initial tumour for good responders. Salvage surgery is necessary in case of poor response. The organs at risk to be considered are bladder, femur heads, small intestine and vulva. The objective of this work is to summarize the epidemiological and radio-anatomic and prognostic characteristics of this tumour. The conformal radiotherapy technique is illustrated by a case report.","1390":"With 12,000 new cases each year in France, rectal cancers are a frequent entity. Concurrent fluoropyrimidin-based chemoradiation followed by a surgery including total mesorectal excision is the standard of care for locally advanced (T3-4) or node positive cancers of the mid and lower rectum. Modalities of irradiation depend on tumour location (mid versus lower rectum) and its local extension. Nevertheless, the clinical target volume (CTV) always encompasses the entire mesorectum, that goes from the peritoneal reflexion line (facing the third sacral vertebrae) to the levator ani muscles. The internal iliac lymph nodes are as well always included in the CTV. The aim of this article is to review the main epidemiological, anatomical, radiological and prognostic factors that are meaningful to define the optimal modalities of conformal radiation of rectal cancers. Definition of target volumes and organs at risk will be discussed, as well as doses and dose-constraints. A case report will be used to illustrate this article.","1391":"Due to its increasing incidence and a grim prognosis, primary liver cancer remains a diagnostic and therapeutic challenge. For small localized tumors, surgical resection and liver transplantation are standard treatments with a curative-intent. Therapeutic options for locally advanced or metastatic diseases are limited. Globally, surgery fits less than 20% of patients. Early detection in high-risk patients and prevention of risk factors remain the key points in the standard care. External radiotherapy is a non invasive treatment with encouraging results for non operable patients. Emerging stereotactic radiotherapy yields high rates of local control without compromising toxicity. Tumors with bad prognostic factors could be cured with this approach.","1392":"","1393":"In the case of lung tumor treatment, to adjust 3D helical computed tomography (CT) acquisition parameters using a dynamic phantom and compare to the theory the volumes of a moving object. Three helical CT acquisitions were compared using a Big Bore CT scan : an \"initial\" 3D CT scan (constructor parameters), an \"optimized\" 3D CT scan which parameters are chosen to obtain an axial slow scan like acquisition and a 4D CT scan. We used a phantom composed by a ball filled with water set on a dynamic platform moving in the antero-posterior or cranio-caudal direction with a 14 mm amplitude and a 4s period. For each acquisition and modality (static and dynamic), we quantified the ball volume by automatic contouring and we estimated relative errors. For an antero-posterior displacement, the volume of the moving ball is under estimated by 14.1 % with the \"initial\" scan, by 0.2 % with the \"optimized\" scan and over estimated by 0.8 % with the averaged 4D scan. For a cranio-caudal displacement, it is under estimated by about 22 % with the \"initial\" scan and by about 1 % with the \"optimized\" scan and the averaged 4D scan. Volume measurements performed with the dynamic phantom allowed us to validate the \"optimized\" 3D CT scan parameters because it accurately reflects the volume of a moving object. Radiotherapy departments without 4D CT should adapt scan parameters for internal target volume definition. ","1394":"Radiation therapy has a major role in the management of infiltrative breast cancers. However, there is no consensus for the prophylactic treatment of the internal mammary chain (IMC), with strategies that show strong differences according to centers and physicians. Indications for internal mammary chain radiotherapy are debated, since this treatment significantly increases the dose delivered to the heart and leads to potential technical difficulties. Important prospective data recently suggested that internal mammary chain radiotherapy would not be necessary, even in cases of internal or central tumor locations, or in patients with positive axillary lymph nodes. Although these data warrant confirmation by two other prospective trials, there is evidence that the indications for internal mammary chain radiotherapy should be careful and that high quality techniques should be used for decreasing the dose delivered to the heart. This review of literature presents the state of art on the radiotherapy of internal mammary chain, with special focus on the indications, techniques, and potential toxicity.","1395":null,"1396":null,"1397":"","1398":"After radical prostatectomy, the risk of biological recurrence at 5 years varies from 10 to 40 % and this natural evolution of the disease has led radiation therapy being proposed as a supplement to surgery. When the recurrence risk is essentially local, supplementary radiotherapy is justified in the aim of improving biological recurrence-free survival, local control, metastasis-free survival and specific and global survival, while respecting patient quality of life. Three recent studies, EORTC 22911, ARO 9602 and SWOG 8794 found a similar advantage for biological recurrence-free survival without higher major additional toxicity. However, only the SWOG 8794 study found a significant improvement for metastasis-free survival and global survival. In an adjuvant setting, the optimal moment to propose this postoperative radiotherapy remains uncertain: should it be proposed systematically to all pT3 R1 patients, running the risk of pointlessly treating patients who will never recur, or should it only be proposed at recurrence? The GETUG AFU 17 trial will provide answers to the question of the optimal moment for postoperative radiotherapy for pT3-4 R1 pN0 Nx patients with the objective of comparing an immediate treatment to a differed early treatment initiated at biological recurrence.","1399":"Locally advanced head and neck cancers are primarily treated by a multimodal approach, including a combination of surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. However, local relapse rate in a previously irradiated area remains high. Reirradiation for a nonoperable recurrence or a new primary tumour is now a therapeutic option thanks to technical progresses. This review presents results of published series in terms of toxicity and tumour response. All the publications are heterogeneous (population, dose, fractionation, concomitant chemotherapy or targeted therapy) and it is thus difficult to compare results. Reirradiation is feasible and appears less toxic with new techniques such as image guided radiotherapy (IMRT) or stereotactic radiotherapy, which could offer precise radiation delivery while sparing healthy tissues. Concomitant chemotherapy or targeted therapy may improve local control. Prospective evaluation of tumour response and complications is necessary.","1400":"Local recurrence after external radiotherapy or brachytherapy occurs in 30% of patients treated for prostate cancer. These recurrences can be localised to the prostate and controlled by salvage treatment. Salvage prostatectomy is the gold standard treatment, however, it is associated with a high morbidity rate. Minimally invasive treatments such as cryotherapy and high intensity focused ultrasound (HIFU) can be proposed to treat local recurrences. Indications, complications and oncological results of these salvage treatments are discussed in this article.","1401":"The treatment of soft tissue sarcomas of limbs should be discussed within an experienced multimodality team. Surgical resection remains the cornerstone of therapy for localized disease and achieves a five years overall survival around 75% and a local recurrence rate as low as 10% in the best series. In complex cases, neo-adjuvant treatments may be used such as systemic chemotherapy, isolated limb perfusion, or radiotherapy to achieve an optimal conservative approach. Molecular genetics of sarcomas and quality of margins are essential to guide diagnosis and therapeutic selection. In case of marginal or incomplete resection, a new enlarged surgical resection should always be discussed before administration of any adjuvant treatments. Many retrospective studies and two randomized studies (one of adjuvant brachytherapy and one of external beam radiotherapy) have shown that adjuvant radiotherapy after complete surgery significantly reduces the risk of local recurrence in extremity soft tissue sarcomas. A randomized study has compared pre- to postoperative radiotherapy. The results in terms of local control are similar in both arms. The risk of surgical complications is higher in the preoperative arm and the risk of late sequelae is higher in the postoperative arm. A randomized study within the French sarcoma group is ongoing evaluating the omission of postoperative radiotherapy in favourable cases. Presently, the role of systematic first-line invasive treatment (including surgery and\/or radiotherapy) of desmoids is debated. It is becoming evident that up to 50% of patients with desmoids benefit from a front-line non-aggressive policy, because growth arrest is a common feature of this disease. Additional study of the molecular determinants of desmoid behaviour is needed to guide treatment.","1402":"Few studies have evaluated the quality of life (QoL) of patients with rectal cancer. This report describes the quality of life of French patients who entered the 22921 EORTC trial that investigated the role and place of chemotherapy (CT) added to preoperative radiotherapy (preop-RT). Patients without recurrences were evaluated with EORTC QLQ-C30 and QLQ-CR38 questionnaires, after a median time of 4.6 years from randomisation. All the scores of QLQ-C30 functions were high, from 78 up to 88, with those of global health quality of life scale (GHQL) status being 73. The mean scores of symptoms were low except for diarrhoea. For QLQ-CR38, the mean scores for \"body image\" and \"future perspective\" were high at 79.6 and 69.7 respectively. The scores for \"sexual functioning\" and \"enjoyment\" were low. Men had more sexual problems than females (62.5 vs 25 mean scores respectively). Chemotherapy was associated with more diarrhoea complaints, lower \"role\", lower \"social functioning\" and lower global health quality of life scale. The overall quality of life of patients with rectal cancer is quite good 4.6 years after the beginning preoperative treatments. However, adding chemotherapy to preoperative radiotherapy has a negative effect on diarrhoea complaints and some quality of life dimensions. ","1403":null,"1404":"External beam radiotherapy (RT) is used to treat all stages of localized prostate cancer. Using a 3D conformal RT (3DCRT) without any androgen deprivation, a clear dose-effect relationship has been shown in terms of both biochemical control and also unfortunately of rectal and urinary toxicity. Compared to a \"standard\" 3DCRT, intensity modulated RT (IMRT) improves the dose distribution by mainly providing concave dose distribution and tight dose gradients. Based on large clinical experiences for at least one decade, IMRT is widely used to increase the dose in the prostate and therefore local control, without increasing toxicity. Indeed, toxicity rates observed after high dose delivered in the prostate (80Gy) with IMRT appear no different than those observed after a standard dose (70Gy) delivered by a standard 3DCRT. Arc IMRT appears a new promising IMRT modality, decreasing dramatically treatment duration. However, this IMRT-based dosimetric benefit may not be translated into a full clinical benefit, if intra-pelvic prostate motion is not taken in account. Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) should be therefore associated with IMRT for a maximal clinical benefit. This article is a literature review showing the interest of both combined approaches.","1405":"The purpose of this review was to analyze data available on reirradiation for high-grade glioma or brain metastasis. This reirradiation can be 3D conformal or stereotactic. There are no randomized trials. No definitive recommendations can be given but solutions can be proposed. In high-grade gliomas, results of 3D conformal irradiation are fair. Stereotactic irradiation produces more encouraging survival rates but the range of doses delivered is too large for allowing recommendations. However, fractions less than 5Gy seem better tolerated. In brain metastases, total brain irradiation seems useful if metastases are multiple and the patient in good condition. With radiosurgery, local control rates are high and survival encouraging. In a retrospective study, bifractionated irradiation looked interesting when compared to radiosurgery. Overall prospective trials seem to be necessary.","1406":"Most of patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) cannot benefit from surgical therapies. Among nonsurgical options, only radiofrequency can challenge surgery for small size tumours. Conformal radiotherapy is likely highly efficient on solitary tumours, but controlled studies are warranted to conclude. Other options are purely palliative. Transarterial hepatic chemoembolization is the goal-standard for multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma and sorafenib for hepatocellular carcinoma with portal vein invasion, leading to modest but significant benefit on survival rates. Yttrium-90 radioembolization is under evaluation through controlled studies, and could be of major interest for multifocal hepatocellular carcinoma with or without portal venous invasion.","1407":null,"1408":"Image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT) combined or not with intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) are new and very useful techniques. However, these new techniques are responsible of irradiation at low dose in large volumes. The control of alignment, realignment of the patient and target positioning in external beam radiotherapy are increasingly performed by radiological imaging devices. The management of this medical imaging depends on the practice of each radiotherapy centre. The physical doses due to the IGRT are however quantifiable and traceable. In one hand, these doses appear justified for a better targeting and could be considered negligible in the context of radiotherapy. On the other hand, the potential impact of these low doses should deserve the consideration of professionals. It appears important therefore to report and consider not only doses in target volumes and in \"standard\" organs at risk, but also the volume of all tissue receiving low doses of radiation. The recent development of IMRT launches the same issue concerning the effects of low doses of radiation. Indeed, IMRT increases the volume of healthy tissue exposed to radiation. At low dose (&lt;100mGy), many parameters have to be considered for health risk estimations: the induction of genes and activation of proteins, bystander effect, radio-adaptation, the specific low-dose radio-hypersensitivity and individual radiation sensitivity. With the exception of the latter, the contribution of these parameters is generally protective in terms of carcinogenesis. An analysis of secondary cancers arising out of field appears to confirm such notion. The risk of secondary tumours is not well known in these conditions of treatment associating IMRT and IGRT. It is therefore recommended that the dose due to imaging during therapeutic irradiation be reported.","1409":"\"Dose-painting\" radiotherapy allows for a heterogeneous delivery of radiation within the tumour volume by targeting radioresistant areas defined by functional imaging. Within gross tumour volume, it is possible to define one or more target volumes based on biology (biological target volume [BTV]) and to apply a strategy of intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) that will deliver a higher dose to these regions. In this review of the literature, we will highlight the biological elements responsible for radioresistance, and how to image them, then we will detail the radiotherapy techniques necessary for this approach, before presenting clinical results in various situations (head and neck tumours, prostate, brain tumours, etc.). Despite many difficulties that make dose-painting IMRT unusable in routine nowadays, biology-guided radiation therapy represents one of the major pathways of development of radiotherapy in the coming years.","1410":"Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is essential to have a dose distribution matching with the planning target volume (PTV) in case of concave-shape target. Today IMRT delivery techniques with linear accelerator can be divided into two classes: techniques with fixed gantry, called \"step and shoot\" (S&amp;S) and \"sliding window\" (SW), and rotational techniques, called intensity modulated arc therapy (IMAT) and volumetric modulated arc therapy (VMAT). We discuss about constraints for IMRT implementation from dosimetric planning to treatment delivery. We compare S&amp;S and VMAT performances concerning dose distribution quality, efficiency and delivery time. We describe quality controls that must be implemented and the methods for analysis and follow-up performances. VMAT tends to yield similar dose distribution to MRT with fixed gantry. VMAT also decreases monitor units as well as treatment delivery time to less than 5 minutes. However, VMAT is an IMRT technique more difficult to master than S&amp;S technique because there are more variable parameters.","1411":"The goal of localized prostate cancer radiotherapy is to cure patients. The decision-making must integrate the survival but also the quality of life of patients. Some French validated self-reported questionnaires are available to evaluate quality of life. Whatever the treatments (radical prostatectomy, brachytherapy, external beam radiation, with or without hormonotherapy), even if patients report more sequelae, their long-term quality of life is similar to that of the general population, except for patients treated with hormonotherapy who complain more decline of physical quality of life. In comparison with prostatectomy, patients treated with external beam radiation report less long-lasting urinary symptoms, but more bowel side effects, with no difference in global quality of life. Sexual disorders are initially less important with external beam radiation but increase over time. Brachytherapy shows no sexual function preservation benefit relative to radiation and may be less favourable with more urinary sequelae. The association of hormonotherapy and external beam radiation decreases the quality of life of the patients, with a negative impact on vitality, sexuality and increase urinary disorders. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) seems to better preserve the long-term digestive quality of life in comparison with conformal radiation therapy. Post-prostatectomy could induce more digestive toxicity, such as rectal irritation. The adjunction of hormonotherapy to radiation, the previous medical history of abdominal surgery, the field of radiation and the acute reactions to radiation are the main predictive factors to late toxicity and should be considered in the choice of initial treatment and for the follow-up.","1412":"Sexual dysfunctions are a quality of life main concern following prostate cancer treatment. After both radiotherapy and brachytherapy, sexual function declines progressively, the onset of occurrence of erectile dysfunction being 12-18 months after both treatments. The pathophysiological pathways by which radiotherapy and brachytherapy cause erectile dysfunction are multifactorial, as patient comorbidities, arterial damage, exposure of neurovascular bundle to high levels of radiation, and radiation dose received by the corpora cavernosa at the crurae of the penis may be important in the aetiology of erectile dysfunction. Diagnosis and treatment of postradiation sexual dysfunctions must integrate pretherapeutic evaluation and information to provide to the patient and his partner a multidisciplinary sexual medicine management.","1413":"The combination of radiotherapy and androgen suppression with luteinizing hormone releasing hormone agonist is mainly devoted to locally advanced prostate cancer and intermediate or poor risk localized prostate cancer. They are based on phase III randomized trials which have shown that for locally advanced prostate cancer, a four-month complete androgen blockade initiated two months prior radiotherapy and stopped at the completion of radiotherapy increased overall survival in patients with Gleason scores 2-6, meanwhile, an adjuvant long-term androgen suppression (2.5 to three years) improved significantly the overall survival. Complete androgen blockade with a four to six months duration, combined with external irradiation, enhanced the overall survival in patients with intermediate or poor risk localized prostate cancer.","1414":"Radiotherapy is nowadays a major therapeutic option in prostate cancer. Technological improvements allowed dose escalation without increasing late toxicity. Some randomized trials have shown that dose escalation decreases the biochemical failure rate, without any benefit in survival with the present follow-up. However, some studies indicate that the distant metastases rate is also decreased. Most of these studies have been done without hormonal treatment, and the role of dose escalation in case of long-term androgen deprivation is unknown. The target volume encompassed the whole gland: however, complete or partial focal treatment of the prostate can be done with sophisticated IMRT technique and must be evaluated. Proximal part of the seminal vesicles must be included in the target volumes. The role of nodal irradiation is another debate, but it could be logically proposed for the unfavourable group.","1415":"Among the different options recommended for high-risk prostate cancer, radical prostatectomy is admitted as radiotherapy, but its role is still controversial in monotherapy and difficult to evaluate in combined treatments. The results of clinical trials combining an external radiotherapy to a long-term androgen deprivation in locally advanced tumours sustain the principle of a multidisciplinary management in high-risk prostate cancer. The impact of surgery on the risk of progression and local recurrence is important in selected patients with low grade and small tumoral volume. Clinical and histological data associated to the MRI assessment remain essential and enhance the preoperative multidisciplinary decision, especially regarding nodal and distant metastases. Radical prostatectomy with an extended pelvic lymphadenectomy can be considered as a viable alternative to radiotherapy and hormonal therapy in these patients with a long life expectancy but presenting a high risk of local progression and a low risk of metastatic disease. Morbidity of the procedure is similar to radical prostatectomy for organ-confined tumours despite more erectile dysfunction due to non-sparing radical prostatectomy in most of cases. Oncological results from recent compiled series show 10- and 15-year specific survival rates around 85 and 75%, respectively, including adjuvant or salvage treatments with radiotherapy, androgen deprivation or chemotherapy.","1416":"Reirradiation represent an unfrequent particular clinical situation. The risk\/benefit ratio assessment must be taken into account, considering both clinical and dosimetric aspects. There is a relatively limited amount of preclinical data available to date and clinicians should cautiously perform reirradiations in selected indications. This review summarizes the experimental data available on reirradiation of normal tissues, the consequences on early and late toxicities as well as the intrinsic limitations of these models.","1417":"The purpose of this literature systematic review was the use of stereotactic radiotherapy in glioma. Research was performed in Medline\/PubMed and associated references found in published articles without publication date limit. The quality of series is variable and many biases can be evidenced. Only two randomized trials have been published using stereotactic radiotherapy for up-front treatment. There is a lack of evidence of survival advantages to use this treatment at the time of diagnosis or relapse. There is also insufficient evidence regarding the benefice\/harms in the use of stereotactic fractionated radiation therapy for patients with glioma. No recommendations can be enounced. Stereotactic irradiation as boost in primary diagnosed glioma or relapsed tumour is not associated with survival improvement. For relapsed patients, treatment needs to be discussed according to the other treatment options.","1418":"A large consensus admits that quality of life is a multifactorial concept including at least physical, psychical and social dimensions of the disease as well as symptoms related to the disease and to the requested treatments. Quality of life is actually considered as one of the major assessment criteria for taking care of patients with cancer and to evaluate results of clinical trials. Self-evaluation by the patient is considered as the gold standard to evaluate the clinical symptoms. This evaluation is not unambiguous. Medical doctors underestimate patients' symptoms. In the field of surgery, development of organ preservation strategies should be considered as one of the major improvement observed in the modern era of head and neck oncology. The role of xerostomia, the most frequent complication reported after head and neck radiation therapy, is major in this field. However, odynophagia is considered as the most detrimental component of quality of life. Radiation oncologists should realize the role of these parameters in order to include these concepts as relevant in the global evaluation of treatments.","1419":"Brachytherapy techniques by permanent implant of radioactive sources or by temporary high-dose-rate (HDR) fractions are nowadays extensively used for the treatment of prostatic carcinoma. Long-term results (at 20 years) concerning large amount of patients have been published by major centers confirming both in terms of efficacy and toxicities that permanent implant of radioactive iodine-125 seeds yields at least the same good results of surgery and of external beam irradiation when proposed to patients affected by low-risk disease. For intermediate to high-risk tumors, HDR temporary implants are proposed as a boost for dose escalation. For both techniques, several topics still need to be clarified dealing with a recent enlargement of indications (HDR alone for low-risk, iodine-125 seeds boost for intermediate-high-risk cancers), or with technical aspects (loose seeds versus linked ones, number of fractions and dose for HDR protocols), while dosimetric issues have only recently been addressed by cooperatives groups. Last but not least, there is a real need to address and clearly characterize the correct definition of biochemical disease control both for iodine permanent implant and for HDR implant. New challenges are facing the prostate-brachytherapy community in the near future: local relapse after external beam radiotherapy are currently managed by several salvage treatments (prostatectomy, cryo, high intensity focused ultrasounds [HIFU]) but the role of reirradiation by brachytherapy is also actively investigated. Focal therapy has gained considerable interest in the last 5 years aiming at treating only the area of cancer foci inside the prostate and preserving nearby healthy tissues. Encouraging results have been obtained with the so-called \"minimally invasive\" approaches and both permanent seed implantation and HDR brachytherapy techniques may be worthwhile testing in this setting because of their capability of exactly sculpting the dose inside the prostatic gland.","1420":"Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) offers optimal dosimetric and clinical results in terms of acute toxicity, allows augmenting the dose to the target volumes and therefore, appears promising for local control and disease-free survival. However, several pitfalls to this treatment are to be considered, namely a long treatment time and a high number of monitor unit (MU) required. The dosimetric results of the volumetric modulated arctherapy gives at least similar target coverage and preservation of organs at risk, while significantly reducing the number of required MUs and the overall treatment time. This has a potential impact on the treatment quality and the potential risk of secondary cancers. Volumetric modulated arctherapy allows implementation of stereotactic radiation therapy and complex treatments previously considered not feasible with IMRT. The future will involve this technology of high precision to determine the dose and to the target in real time using the image-guided radiotherapy. Tools combining these two methods are in development.","1421":"We present the results of two retrospective studies, one regarding reirradiation of spinal tumours and the second, concerning lung tumours. In the first case, primary or secondary tumours were located in or in contact with the vertebrae and spinal cord. The first irradiation has given a full dose to the spinal cord. In the second case, primary or secondary lung tumours have already been treated by irradiation alone or by radiochemotherapy. No grade 3 or 4 early toxicity has been found. Preliminary clinical results are encouraging. The use of CyberKnife represents a major therapeutic advance in the management of irradiated spinal or lung lesions. The possibility of sparing organs at risk and increasing the dose in the tumour target volume are the main advantages.","1422":"Curative therapy for patients with small-cell lung cancer (SCLC) is based on multidrug chemotherapy combinations and radiotherapy. After a long time follow-up, the aim of the study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of sequential chemo-radiotherapy and the effect of prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI). From 1995-2005, 96 patients with SCLC (64 limited-disease [LD], 32 extensive-disease [ED]; median age 61 years [range 39-79]) were treated at our department with varying chemotherapy regimens and sequential mediastinal radiotherapy (50 Gy + 10 Gy boost in case of residual disease after chemotherapy). Afterwards, 15 patients with LD, good general condition and at least partial response after local treatment received PCI (30 Gy). After a median follow-up of 78.6 months, 20 patients remained alive (20.8%, median survival time 18.2 months). The 2-\/5-year overall survival rates were 33.8% and 12.6%, the 2-\/5-year loco-regional control rates were 30.3% and 24.5%, respectively. Distant metastases occurred in 43 patients (24 cerebral). Cerebral metastasis occurred in 6.7% and 27.2% of the patients with PCI and without PCI respectively. Only tumor stage showed a statistically significant impact on overall survival and loco-regional control in multivariate analysis. Radiotherapy was well tolerated. Grade 3\/4 toxicity occurred in seven patients. Prognosis of patients with SCLC remains poor. Administration of PCI in selected patients bears a decrease in the incidence of cerebral metastases. Alternative chemotherapy schemes as well as irradiation schemes and techniques should be the substance of future randomized trials. ","1423":null,"1424":"Langerhans cell histiocytosis is a non-malignant proliferative disease of unknown etiology that can affect one or more organs. This is a rare disease, 1 to 2\/100,000, affecting mainly children with a male predominance. The osseous lesions are the most frequent (60 to 90%). There is however no consensus treatment for the management of these sites. We report the cases of two patients successfully treated with radiotherapy after primary chemotherapy, at doses of 15 Gy in ten sessions of 1.5 Gy for one patient and 18 Gy in ten fractions of 1.8 Gy for the other. Single or multifocal bone Langerhans cell histiocytosis without visceral involvement is a benign, self-limiting affection in most cases. Some bone lesions could be treated by radiotherapy alone. But the high variability of doses currently given in the literature does not allow determining the lowest effective dose limiting the risk of secondary neoplasia or impaired growth in children, in whom lower doses of 6 to 8 Gy are recommended. The decision of radiotherapy must be weighed against the risk of the disease. Caution should be the rule in this non-malignant tumour pathology.","1425":null,"1426":"Surgery is the treatment of choice for localized uterine sarcomas. We conducted a retrospective study to define prognostic factors. We studied 111 cases of patients treated by adjuvant radiotherapy for uterine sarcoma in seven French centers. The median decline was 31 months. We conducted a univariate analysis to identify factors correlated with local recurrence. The statistically significant factors were studied in multivariate analysis by Cox model. The median dose of external beam radiotherapy was 45 Gy. Forty-three percent of patients had vaginal vault brachytherapy and 21 % chemotherapy. Only 6.3 % of patients had complications of acute grade III and 8.1 % of long-term sequelae of radiotherapy. The survival rate at 5 years was 74.6 %. They noted 12.6 % of isolated locoregional recurrences, against 29.7 % for distant recurrences, 80 % were pulmonary. Factors correlated with the risk of locoregional relapse were menopausal status (P = 0.045) and surgical margins suspicious or not healthy (P = 0.0095). The chemotherapy did not improve overall survival or disease free survival but the numbers were low. The postoperative radiotherapy provides good local control in this disease. Brachytherapy is sometimes done, but it does not improve local control. Chemotherapy is not a standard localized stage but the rate of metastatic recurrence calls for the development of strategies involving systemic treatment with radiotherapy. ","1427":"In order to perform a clinical trial in oncology, the choice of the primary endpoint is a major concern, not only for sample size calculation but also regarding the clinical meaning of the results which represents treatment utility for patients or public health system. Endpoints could be classified in two categories: \"clinical endpoints\" including overall survival and health related quality of life (QoL); \"biological markers\" including, for example, progression free survival (PFS). If conceptual and methodological limits of quality of life are well identified with dedicated researches, limits of progression free survival remain less targeted and known by clinicians. Numerous clinical trials having only demonstrated a progression free survival benefit could be discussed according to clinical benefit. In this context, quality of life constitutes an available and a useful alternative endpoint for trials to ensure treatment benefit in a patient or public health point of view. As quality of life, methodological researches should be pursued to improve scientific robustness for assessments and analyses of progression free survival.","1428":"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy generally induces significant changes in the pathological extent of disease. This potential down-staging challenges the standard indications of adjuvant radiation therapy. We assessed the utility of lymph node irradiation in breast cancer patients with pathological N0 status (pN0) after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and breast-conserving surgery. Among 1054 breast cancer patients treated with neoadjuvant chemotherapy in our institution between 1990 and 2004, 248 patients with clinical N0 or N1-N2 lymph node status at diagnosis had pN0 status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy and breast-conserving surgery. Cox regression analysis was used to identify factors influencing locoregional recurrence-free survival, disease-free survival and overall survival. All 248 patients received breast irradiation, and 158 patients (63.7%) also received lymph node irradiation. With a median follow-up of 88 months, the 5-year locoregional recurrence-free survival and overall survival rates were respectively 89.4% and 88.7% with lymph node irradiation and 86.2% and 92% without lymph node irradiation (no significant difference). Survival was poorer among patients who did not have a pathological complete primary tumor response (pCR) (hazards ratio [HR]=3.05; 95% CI, 1.17 to 7.99) and in patients with N1-N2 clinical status at diagnosis ([HR]=2.24; 95% CI, 1.15 to 4.36). Lymph node irradiation did not significantly affect survival. Relative to combined breast and local lymph node irradiation, isolated breast irradiation does not appear to be associated with a higher risk of locoregional relapse or death among breast cancer patients with pN0 status after neoadjuvant chemotherapy. These results need to be confirmed in a prospective study. ","1429":null,"1430":"The aim of this retrospective study is to determine the epidemiological, clinical, therapeutic aspects and prognostic factors of breast cancer in women through a comparative study of 648 patients treated for breast cancer: 165 patients are at 35 years of age or less (G 1), 286 patients are more than 35 years old and non menopausal (G 2). We have collected, for each group, the epidemioclinical data. Nonmetastatic and operable cancer was treated by surgery (conservative or radical) followed by an adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, hormomotherapy) that was indicated according to prognosis factors. Locally advanced forms or metastatic at the moment of diagnosis were treated firstly by chemotherapy. T2N1 forms with lymph node involvement, high grade (SBR II, III) and negative hormonal receptors (HR-) were predominant. There was no difference between the two groups of women concerning risk factors or clinical criterias, except for the mammography that was more sensible in the second group. The breast cancer in our young patient doesn't seem to be different from the older ones either in clinical presentation or evolution. The conclusions of different authors are divergent but they are all for evoluated forms with more defavorable prognosis than in the older women. ","1431":"To determine prospectively the factors associated with reconstruction failure (i.e. requiring expander removal) and capsular contracture in patients undergoing mastectomy and immediate two-stage breast reconstruction with a tissue expander and implant, and radiotherapy for breast cancer. This is a multi-institutional prospective nonrandomized trial. Between 2\/1998 and 9\/2006, we prospectively evaluated 141 consecutive patients who received 141 implants after mastectomy and underwent chest wall radiotherapy (46 to 50 Gy in 23 to 25 fractions). Patients were evaluated after 24 to 36 months by two senior physicians (radiation oncologist and surgeon). Medical follow-up was 37 months. Baker 1 and 2 capsular contracture was observed in 67.5% of patients, Baker 3 and 4 in 32.5%. There were 32 reconstruction failures. In a univariate analysis, the following factors were associated with Baker 3 and 4 capsular contracture: surgeon, use of hormonotherapy and smoking, of which only one remained in the multivariate analysis: surgeon. In a univariate analysis, the following factors were associated with reconstruction failure: tumor size T3 or T4, smoking, pN+ axilla. Three factors remained associated with reconstruction failure in a multiple logistic regression: large tumors T3\/T4, smoking and pN+ axilla. Mastectomy, radiotherapy and immediate breast reconstruction with a tissue expander and implant should be considered when breast conserving surgery has been denied. Adequate patients can be easily selected by using three factors of favourable outcome. ","1432":"The limited ability to control for a tumour's location compromises the accuracy with which radiation can be delivered to tumour-bearing tissue. The resultant requirement for larger treatment volumes to accommodate target uncertainty restricts the radiation dose because more surrounding normal tissue is exposed. With image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT), these volumes can be optimized and tumouricidal doses may be delivered, achieving maximum tumour control with minimal complications. Moreover, with the ability of high precision dose delivery and real-time knowledge of the target volume location, IGRT has initiated the exploration of new indications in radiotherapy such as hypofractionated radiotherapy (or stereotactic body radiotherapy), deliberate inhomogeneous dose distributions coping with tumour heterogeneity (dose painting by numbers and biologically conformal radiation therapy), and adaptive radiotherapy. In short: \"individualized radiotherapy\". Tumour motion management, especially for thoracic tumours, is a particular problem in this context both for the delineation of tumours and organs at risk as well as during the actual treatment delivery. The latter will be covered in this paper with some examples based on the experience of the UZ Brussel. With the introduction of the NOVALIS system (BrainLAB, Feldkirchen, Germany) in 2000 and consecutive prototypes of the ExacTrac IGRT system, gradually a hypofractionation treatment protocol was introduced for the treatment of lung tumours and liver metastases evolving from motion-encompassing techniques towards respiratory-gated radiation therapy with audio-visual feedback and most recently dynamic tracking using the VERO system (BrainLAB, Feldkirchen, Germany). This evolution will be used to illustrate the recent developments in this particular field of research.","1433":"To assess the outcome and the management of solitary extramedullary plasmocytoma in the head and neck region. From 1997 to 2008, five cases of solitary extramedullary plasmocytoma were treated in the department of radiotherapy at Salah-Azaiz Institute. Three patients had a solitary plasmocytoma of the nasal fossa; the others were ethmoidal and submandibular node. All patients received irradiation of 40 to 45 Gy in the primary site associated to surgery in four cases. Among the five patients, two had radiotherapy after recurrence. Four complete responses were noted with a follow-up of 12, 36, 52 and 72 months. Multiple myeloma occurred in one patient 8 years after treatment. Radiotherapy is the best effective local treatment. Local control of extramedullary plasmocytoma in the head and neck region seems to be improved when the dose is at least 45 Gy. Predictive parameters of unfavourable outcome and conversion of extramedullary plasmocytoma to multiple myeloma should be better defined. ","1434":"The purpose of this paper was to make a brief review of the main problematics raised by depression in oncology in terms of prevalence, semiology, screening, risk, prognosis factors and treatment. This reflection was based on recent literature data obtained through a PubMed search. Depressive disorders have frequently been encountered in cancer patients. During routine oncology daily care, depression screening, assessment and treatment are of paramount importance regarding psychosocial management. Depressive elements have a tremendous impact on the quality of life, tolerance and compliance with anticancer treatment. Moreover, depression morbidity and its possible influence on prognosis represent an important challenge in terms of prevention. A specific semiology for depressive disorders in the oncologic field might be more relevant with practical clinical implications. Optimal care of these mood disorders have to be implemented as soon as possible and be supported by the association of pharmacological treatment and psychotherapy.","1435":"In the following article, we will discuss general issues relating to acute and late gastric's radiation toxicities. The tolerance of the stomach to complete or partial organ irradiation is more unappreciated than for most other organs. We consulted the Medline database via PubMed and used the key words gastric--radiotherapy--toxicity. Currently, 60 Gy or less is prescribed in gastric radiation therapy. Acute clinical toxicity symptoms are predominantly nausea and vomiting. Although there is a general agreement that the whole stomach tolerance is for doses of 40 to 45 Gy without unacceptable complication, it is well established that a stomach dose of 35 Gy increases the risk of ulcer complications.","1436":"Ionizing radiation is frequently used for cancers with a curative intent for many patients. The total dose delivered on the tumour plays a major factor for locoregional control. Increasing the dose to the tumour volume is generally correlated with an increased dose to normal tissue. Dose constraints to organs at risk must be taken into account for the planning of external beam radiation. A high dose will generate more acute and late side effects. Medical doctors should record these toxicities prospectively. Registration and grading should be simple, reproducible and sensitive in order to obtain an accurate and appropriate evaluation for each organ. Several scales have been published in the literature (WHO, EORTC\/RTOG, LENT-SOMA, NCI CTCAE) but none have a satisfactory level. The National Cancer Institute has proposed several version of the CTCAE and its latest version 4.0, currently appears to be the most adapted. The advantage of using only this common and universal classification will be to harmonize practices and have a common language.","1437":"The radiation dose received by the eye depends on the pathology, tumour location (ocular globe, orbit, neighboring structures) and the radiation technique. The major complication is the complete loss of vision, which is often multifactorial. This article, based on a literature review, describes the radiation effects and the tolerance doses for all eye structures: cornea, lens, retina, optic nerves, orbit and ocular adnexa.","1438":"Xerostomia is one of the most a common complication of radiotherapy for head and neck cancers, affecting quality of life. Parotid glands produce approximately 60% of saliva and submandibular glands 20% of saliva while the rest is secreted by sublingual and accessory salivary glands. Methods of measuring the salivary output are collection of unstimulated or stimulated saliva or 99mTc-pertechnate scintigraphy. Several studies demonstrated that late salivary dysfunction after radiotherapy has been correlated to the mean parotid gland dose, with recovery occurring with time. Severe xerostomia could be avoided if at one parotid gland is spared to a mean dose of less than approximately 25-30 Gy. Clinical benefit of submandibular gland sparing is more controversial. A mean dose less than 39 Gy could preserve submandibular gland function. This paper aims to review main studies evaluating tolerance dose of salivary glands.","1439":"The main objective of this work was to describe, based on a literature survey, the radiation-induced toxicity of the ear and to try to establish the limiting dose. The limiting toxicity was the sensorineural hearing loss. A dose-effect relationship has been described by several authors. Thirty to 40% of patients who are irradiated for head and neck cancer are concerned, but the intensity of the hearing loss tends to depend on the exact localisation of the primary tumour: nasopharyngeal irradiations, paranasal sinusal and parotid irradiation are at greater risk of complication. High frequencies are more vulnerable than the lower ones. Age of patients, as well as baseline hearing abilities, deeply influence the issue. As far as possible, the dose to the inner ear--the cochlea more precisely--should be kept under 40 Gy. In case of association with other causes of toxicity (such as age, low baseline value, association to cisplatin), this dose should be as low as possible. Should carcinologic constraints lead to toxic doses, then patients should be properly informed.","1440":"Bone marrow is one of the major dose-limiting tissue for radiotherapy. It is composed of many sub-units with complex regulatory mechanisms implying cytokines and growth factors, dispersed throughout the skeleton, each acting with a semi-autonomy but are unified into an integrated system that responds to ionizing radiations as one critical organ. A better knowledge of the complexity of this tissue's distribution and physiology is fundamental to understanding and forecasting the consequences of radiation-induced bone marrow injury. According to cancer characteristics, the volume of hematopoietic bone marrow included within radiation fields and the dose it receives vary in a very significant way, and finally the impact on blood cell count varies in widely different ranges. Furthermore, to predict the overall risk of therapy-induced hematological toxicities, it is necessary to take into account the possible contemporary administration of other cytotoxic drugs (before and\/or during radiation therapy). Conversely, the hematological toxicity of usually well-tolerated chemotherapies can be increased, if the patient has a history of radiotherapy. Although the importance of minimizing the volume of active bone marrow exposed to ionizing radiations is well established, so far, no consensual recommendation exists about the dose-volume relationship between bone marrow irradiation and hematological tolerance. Data have recently emerged from trials studying the interest of IMRT for treatment of pelvic malignancies which confirm that reducing bone marrow exposure to irradiation prevents the rise of hematological toxicities during and after radiation therapy, even if some questions remain unanswered on how to define the contours of bone marrow volume.","1441":"The small bowel is a hollow organ involved in the transit and absorption of food. In relation to its anatomical location, a significant amount of this organ is exposed in whole or in part to ionizing radiation in external radiotherapy during abdominal or pelvic irradiation either for primary cancers or metastasis. The acute functional changes during external beam radiation are mainly leading to diarrhea, abdominal pain and bloating. The main late side effects of irradiation of the small intestine are chronic diarrhea, malabsorption with steatorrhea, abdominal spasms, intestinal obstruction, bleeding and fistulas. The architecture of the small intestine may be considered as parallel with a significant correlation between the irradiated volume of small bowel and the likelihood of acute toxicity, whatever the dose. The literature analysis recommends to consider the volume of small bowel receiving 15 Gy (threshold of 100 to 200 cm(3)) but also 30 and 50 Gy (thresholds of 35 to 300 cm(3), depending on the level of dose considered). Modern techniques of conformal radiotherapy with modulated intensity will probably have beneficial impact on small bowel toxicity.","1442":"Since the prolongation of survival for patients treated by radiotherapy second primary cancers are not rare. Cumulative incidence of second primary malignancy after radiotherapy (SPMAR) 40 years after treatment can reach 20 % when patients were 40 years old at treatment time. Among SPMAR some of them can be promoted by irradiation. Relative risk (RR) analysis is the most common method used to estimate the proportion of such second cancers. Most of studies reported a RR around 1.1 in adult patients. In young patients RR is about 6, meaning that SPMAR attributable to irradiation is more elevated in this subgroup. Quantification of these events, biomolecular mechanisms, risk factors are complex and not yet fully understood. Information given to patients must be adapted and the cost\/benefit ratio has to be justified regarding SPMAR risk. Irradiation technique optimisation is an important point especially in young patient and adults, in order to reduce at maximum the volume of organ at risk exposed while not compromising optimal dose given to the tumour volume, although no standard rules of irradiation are definitively established at the present time.","1443":"The a priori evaluation of normal tissue complication probability is an important issue for the radiation oncologist looking for the best therapeutic index. The advances in radiobiological and technological knowledge provide a better understanding of the determinants of radiation effects. The amount of information required to optimize the treatment modalities justifies the use of mathematical models linking the treatment characteristics (dose, volume, treatment time...) to the likelihood of complications. The radiation oncologist needs a minimal understanding of the mathematical models and their limits to justify his prescriptions.","1444":"In oncology, the ratio between cure and morbidity (therapeutic index) is at the heart of treatment. Every radiotherapy needs to optimize the benefice-risk issue defining the optimal medical care. In order to go from global knowledge (evidence-based medicine) to individualized decision, the principle of patients' information will have always to be respected. In fine, it will be the patient, guided by his\/her physician, to take decision on treatment.","1445":"Ionizing radiations induce cell death, causing deterministic or stochastic side-effects. This paper briefly summarizes the biological mechanisms of early and late side-effects of ionizing radiations on healthy tissue.","1446":"The liver is a large abdominal organ in the right hypondrium. Because of its anatomical situation, it is near many abdominal PTVs as well as some lower thoracic PVTs. The liver could also be at the same time the target (for irradiation of liver metastases or primary liver tumours) and organ at risk (OAR). Radiation-induced liver disease (RILD) is radiobiologically the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP), i.e., the clinical event limiting the total dose that could be delivered. This review describes radiobiological criteria justifying the NTCP data, and recommendations for conformal 3D radiotherapy and stereotactic liver irradiation.","1447":"For head and neck cancers, the radiation dose usually needed to sterilize a macroscopic tumour is at least 70 Gy in conventional fractionation. In the larynx, this dose level enables optimal tumour control while exposing the patient to a limited risk of severe complications. For oropharynx and nasopharynx tumors, it is sometimes possible to limit the dose received by the larynx according to the extent of the primary lesion. Thus, if the tumour constraints permit, the maximum dose to the larynx must be less than 63 to 66 Gy. To reduce the risk of laryngeal edema, it is recommended if possible to limit the mean non-involved larynx dose to 40 to 45 Gy. In the pharynx, literature's data suggested to minimize the volume of the pharyngeal constrictor muscles receiving a dose greater than or equal to 60 Gy. Limiting the volume receiving a dose greater than or equal to 50 Gy reduces the risk of dysphagia. These dose constraints should be tailored to each patient taking into account the extent of the initial primary lesion, the possible addition of chemotherapy or a modified fractionation radiotherapy.","1448":"The impact of curative radiotherapy depends mainly on the total dose delivered homogenously in the targeted volume. Nevertheless, the dose delivered to the surrounding healthy tissues may reduce the therapeutic ratio of many radiation treatments. Two different side effects (acute and late) can occur during and after radiotherapy. Of particular interest are the radiation-induced sequelae due to their irreversibility and the potential impact on daily quality of life. In a same population treated in one centre with the same technique, it appears that individual radiosensitivity clearly exists. In the hypothesis that genetic is involved in this area of research, lymphocytes seem to be the tissue of choice due to easy accessibility. Recently, low percentage of CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte apoptosis were shown to be correlated with high grade of sequelae. In addition, recent data suggest that patients with severe radiation-induced late side effects possess four or more single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in candidate genes (ATM, SOD2, TGFB1, XRCC1, and XRCC3) and low radiation-induced CD8 lymphocyte apoptosis in vitro. On-going studies are being analyzing the entire genome using a Genome-wide association study (GWAS) analysis.","1449":"Acute skin toxicity is frequent during radiation therapy and can lead to temporary arrest of the treatment. Chronic toxicity can occur and conduct to cosmetic problems. Alopecia is the most frequent toxicity concerning hair and is most of the time reversible. Several factors linked to patients influence skin toxicity, such as undernutrition, old age, obesity, smoking, skin diseases, autoimmune diseases, failure of DNA reparation. Skin, hair and nail toxicities depend also on radiation schedule. Acute toxicity is greater when dose per fraction increases. Chronic and acute toxicities are more often when total dose increases. Under 45 Gy, the risk of severe skin toxicity is low, and begins above 50 Gy. Skin toxicity depends also on the duration of radiotherapy and split course schedules are associated with less toxicities. Irradiation surface seems to influence skin toxicity but interaction is more complex. Reirradiation is often feasible in case of cancer recurrence but with a risk of grade 3-4 toxicity above all in head and neck cancer. The benefit\/risk ratio has to be always precisely evaluated. Permanent alopecia is correlated with the follicle dose. Modern techniques of radiation therapy allow to spare skin.","1450":"The thyroid is the most developed endocrine gland of the body. Due to its anatomical location, it may be exposed to ionizing radiation in external radiotherapy involving head and neck. This review aims to describe the thyroid radiation disorders, probably under-reported in the literature, their risk factors and follow-up procedures. The functional changes after external beam radiation consists mainly of late effects occurring beyond 6 months, and are represented by the clinical and subclinical hypothyroidism. Its incidence is approximately 20 to 30% and it can occur after more than 25 years after radiation exposure. Hyperthyroidism and auto-immune manifestations have been described in a lesser proportion. The morphological changes consist of benign lesions, primarily adenomas, and malignant lesions, the most feared and which incidence is 0.35%. The onset of hypothyroidism depends of the total dose delivered to the gland, and the irradiated. Modern techniques of conformal radiotherapy with modulated intensity could improve the preservation of the thyroid, at the expense of the increase in low doses and the theoretical risk of secondary cancers.","1451":"Describing dose constraints for organs at risk in external beam radiotherapy is a key-point in order to maximise the therapeutic ratio. In head and neck irradiation, mandible is frequently exposed to ionising radiation-related complications. Those complications will be exposed after a short description of anatomical and physiopathological aspects. A literature search was performed using the Pubmed-Medline database, with following keywords \"Osteoradionecrosis, Radiotherapy, Mandible, Toxicity, Organ at risk, Trismus\". Incidence and dose constraints will be reported. The incidence of osteoradionecrosis decreased since the 1990s, but it remains a dreaded late complication of head and neck cancer radiotherapy. It essentially occurs with cumulative doses of 66 Gy on the mandible (standard fractionation) applied to a significant volume. Respecting oral care is crucial to avoid this kind of complication. The respect of the dose-constraint described should not lead to undertreat tumor bed in a curative intent. Trismus related to ionising radiation is poorly described. Literature data cannot lead to describe precise dose constraints.","1452":"The arrival of new technologies and the increase of the possible planned treatments require tools to evaluate and compare the delivered dose to specific organs at risk. Among several options providing the same tumour control, the choice will be made in favour of those that best spare the organs at risk. The evaluation tools have to report acute and late complications, and to be simple to use. The evaluation of the delivered dose to specific organs at risk is currently based on dose-volume histograms, conformal index and the integral dose. However, many questions remain as to reducing the normal tissue toxicity: is it better to deliver a relatively lower dose over a large volume or a relatively higher dose over a smaller volume? The long-term clinical follow-up of patients remains necessary.","1453":"","1454":"Radiation pneumonitis is the most common dose limiting complication of thoracic radiation. Clinically significant radiation pneumonitis usually develops in 10-20% of patients. Characteristic clinical features associated with radiation pneumonitis include dyspnea, non-productive cough, radiographic opacification confined to the outlines of the field of radiation treatment and changes in pulmonary function measures. The risk of radiation pneumonitis is related to the cumulative dose of radiation to normal tissue and to patients and tumor features. Some studies demonstrated that preexisting pulmonary lung dysfunction, tumour location in lower lobes, use of concurrent chemotherapy could increase the risk of radiation pneumonitis. Controversies persist about which dosimetric parameter optimally predicts the risk of radiation pneumonitis. Mean lung dose, V20 and V30 are the most studied parameters. However, no ideal dosimetric parameter has been identified. The objective of this review is to summarize predictive factors of radiation pneumonitis, and to evaluate the predictive ability of various dose-volume histogram parameters for routine practice.","1455":"Plexopathies and peripheral neuropathies appear progressively and with several years delay after radiotherapy. These lesions are observed principally after three clinical situations: supraclavicular and axillar irradiations for breast cancer, pelvic irradiations for various pathologies and limb irradiations for soft tissue sarcomas. Peripheral nerves and plexus (brachial and lumbosacral) are described as serial structures and are supposed to receive less than a given maximum dose linked to the occurrence of late injury. Literature data, mostly ancient, define the maximum tolerable dose to a threshold of 60 Gy and highlight also a great influence of fractionation and high fraction doses. For peripheral nerves, most frequent late effects are pain with significant differences of occurrence between 50 and 60 Gy. At last, associated pathologies (diabetes, vascular pathology, neuropathy...) and associated treatments have probably to be taken into account as additional factors, which may increase the risk of these late radiation complications.","1456":"To compare two Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) techniques for prostate cancer: the Volumetric Modulated Arc Therapy (VMAT) and the \"Step and Shoot\" technique (S&amp;S). VMAT and S&amp;S plans (RX 18MV) were created and compared (Wilcoxon test) for 10 patients. The dosimetric goal of both treatments was to deliver 46 Gy to the seminal vesicles and 80 Gy to the prostate, while respecting the dose constrains in the organs at risk of toxicity. For one patient, the two techniques were compared for dose painting and escalation in target volumes defined on MRI and registered thanks to intraprostatic fiducials. VMAT, compared to S&amp;S, offered: an increase of the PTV2s (prostate) volume receiving 77 to 80 Gy and a decrease of V(82) and V(83); a decrease of V(4) to V(6), V(16) to V(23), and V(69) to V(73) for the rectal wall; a decrease of V(25) for the bladder wall; a decrease of V(21) to V(43) for the femoral heads; a decrease of V(26) to V(44) and V(72) to V(80) but an increase of V(1) to V(21) and V(49) to V(60) for the healthy tissues. The Conformal Index \"COIN\" was better with VMAT than S&amp;S (0.60 to 0.66). The delivered MU were significantly reduced with VMAT (8% mean) as well as the delivery time (4 min to 1.5 min). VMAT allowed delivering theorically 90Gy in the peripheral zone and 100 Gy in the tumor. In case of prostate irradiation, VMAT shows improvement compared with S&amp;S. In particular, organs at risk are better spared, the delivery time is shortened and the number of delivered UM is decreased. ","1457":"Radiation proctitis is among the most frequent radiation-induced toxicities. This is related to the high frequency of pelvic tumours and the key role of radiotherapy in the treatment of these tumours. Late rectal toxicity usually occurs within the first two years after the completion of a radiotherapy course. Rectal bleeding and a rectal syndrome are the main symptoms, and can be associated to fistulas or rectal ulcers. Clinical factors, such as diabetes mellitus, a severe acute radiation toxicity, small rectal volume or radiation hypersensitivity, are associated with late rectal toxicity. Dosimetric factors derived from the analysis of dose-volume histograms can also predict the occurrence of radiation proctitis, and help to adapt the prescribed dose and the ballistic of irradiation.","1458":"Radiation tolerance for bone tissue has been mostly evaluated with regard to bone fracture. Main circumstances are mandibula osteoradionecrosis, hip and costal fracture, and patent or radiologic fractures in the treated volume. After radiation therapy of bone metastasis, the analysis of related radiation fracture is difficult to individualize from a pathologic fracture. Frequency of clinical fracture is less than 5% in the large series or cohorts and is probably underevaluated for the asymptomatic lesions. Women older than 50 years and with osteoporosis are probably the main population at risk. Dose-effect relations are difficult to qualify in older series. Recent models evaluating radiations toxicity on diaphysa suggest an important risk after 60 Gy, for high dose-fraction and for a large volume.","1459":"Radiation myelopathy is one of the most dreadful complications of radiation therapy. Despite multiple animal experiments and human autopsic series, its pathogenesis remains largely unknown. In most instances, the classical aspect of myelomalacy combines glial and vascular injuries in various sequences. Recent studies point out the role of oligodendrocytes and their precusors, as well as of intercellular mediators (cytokines and stress molecules). The clinical presentation comprises a spectrum of non specific neurological symptoms whose evolution is sometimes regressive but more commonly progressive and life-threatening. Usually, it occurs following a latent period of six months to two years after irradiation of the cervical, thoracic or upper lumbar spine to a dose in excess of 50 Gy, conventionally fractionated. Nonetheless, these typical features can be altered by extrinsic factors, such as hypofractionation\/acceleration of the dose, multiple surgical procedures, chemotherapy especially megatherapy, or neurotoxic drugs. Conversely, hyperfractionated regimens that take into account protracted half-time repair of sublethal damages to the CNS, as well as sophisticated estimates of the dose to the cord and QA programs during the treatment course minimize such risks.","1460":"Radistion thoracic tumors may be associated with cardiac toxicity because of the central position of the heart in the thorax. The present review aims to describe the cardiotoxicity during radiotherapy of different tumor sites most associated with this complication and the risk factors of cardiotoxicity during radiation therapy. Medline literature searches were performed using the following cardiac--heart--radiotherapy--toxicity--cardiotoxicity--breast cancer--lymphoma. Cardiac toxicity after breast cancer and mediastinal lymphoma is the most reported radiation-induced complication. The most frequent clinical complications are pericarditis, congestive heart failure, and heart infarction. These events are mostly asymptomatic. Thus clinicians have to give particular attention to these complications. Anthracyclin treatment is a major risk factor for additional cardiotoxicity during radiotherapy with a synergistic effect. Correction of cardiovascular risk is an important point of the prevention of heart complications. Total dose delivered to the planned target volume (PTV), the dose per fraction and the irradiated volume were correlated to the risk of cardiotoxicity. Volume of heart receiving 35 Gy must be inferior to 30% and dose per fraction should not exceed 2 Gy when dose of prescription exceeds 30 Gy. Maximum heart distance (maximal thickness of heart irradiated) must be less than 1cm during irradiation of breast cancer. Modern irradiation techniques seem to be associated with a limited risk of heart complication. The use of anthracycline, other cardiotoxic chemotherapies and targeted therapies should incite for great caution by performing a careful treatment planning and optimisation.","1461":"Anticancer treatments-induced central nervous system neurotoxicity has become a major problem in recent years. Real advances in therapeutic results for cancer treatments have improved patients' survival. Nowadays, central nervous system radiation therapy is widely prescribed, both for palliative and curative treatments in the management of malignant or benign tumors. Recent data on tolerance of normal central nervous system to radiation therapy are reviewed here, early and delayed radiation-induced effects are described and dose recommendations are suggested for clinical practice.","1462":"The esophagus is a musculo-membranous tube through which food passes from the pharynx to the stomach. Due to its anatomical location, it can be exposed to ionizing radiation in many external radiotherapy indications. Radiation-induced esophageal mucositis is clinically revealed by dysphagia and odynophagia, and usually begins 3 to 4 weeks after the start of radiation treatment. With the rise of multimodality treatments (e.g., concurrent chemoradiotherapy, dose escalation and accelerated fractionation schemes), esophageal toxicity has become a significant dose-limiting issue. Understanding the predictive factors of esophageal injury may improve the optimal delivery of treatment plans. It may help to minimize the risks, hence increasing the therapeutic ratio. Based on a large literature review, our study describes both early and late radiation-induced esophageal injuries and highlights some of the predictive factors for cervical and thoracic esophagus toxicity. These clinical and dosimetric parameters are numerous but none is consensual. The large number of dosimetric parameters strengthens the need of an overall analysis of the dose\/volume histograms. The data provided is insufficient to recommend their routine use to prevent radiation-induced esophagitis. Defining guidelines for the tolerance of the esophagus to ionizing radiation remains essential for a safe and efficient treatment.","1463":"Radiation damages to the kidney represent uncommonly reported toxicity, not because kidneys are radioresistant, but because clinical symptomatology is not specific and may not manifest for years after treatment. Nevertheless, late effects can result in considerable morbidity and mortality, in considering moderate dose of irradiation. Data on tolerance of the kidney to radiation therapy are reviewed here, early and late radiation-induced effects are described and dose recommendations are suggested for clinical practice.","1464":"The bladder is a hollow visco-elastic organ involved in urinary continence. In relation to its anatomical location, bladder is exposed in whole or in part to ionizing radiation in external radiotherapy or in brachytherapy of the pelvic region. The acute and late functional changes after external beam radiation consist in urinary frequency, compliance defaults and hematuria. Incidence of urinary side-effects, as well as related modalities of radiotherapy, is poorly described in the literature. Medline literature searches were performed via PubMed using the keywords \"bladder--radiotherapy--toxicity--radiation cystitis--tolerability--organ at risk\" to describe urinary side-effects due to radiation. Some recommendations exist on the dose constraints applied to bladder. These were mainly established from prostate radiation therapy studies but without definitive consensus. In clinical practice, dose constraints take into account clinical settings: bladder cancer which requires total bladder irradiation or others pelvic tumours (prostate, uterus...) in which the bladder is considered as an organ at risk. Risks of radiation cystitis increase with total dose (above 60 Gy), bladder irradiated volume and concomitant chemoradiation. Modern techniques using conformal radiotherapy with modulated intensity will probably have beneficial impact on bladder toxicity.","1465":"We report the case of a 66-year-old patient with a pilomatrix carcinoma from the right submandibular region with pulmonary and cerebral metastases. The histological confirmation of the diagnosis has been based on the biopsy of the submandibular tumefaction which was rapidly growing. We tried at first a doxorubicine and cisplatine chemotherapy because of the considerable locoregional extension and the existence of pulmonary metastases. The patient response to three cures of chemotherapy was spectacular with a partial clinical response (75%) and a partially cleaned-up chest observed in the radiological evaluation. In the 5th cycle of chemotherapy following the same protocol, the patient presented a relapse with cerebral metastases. The patient received hypofractionated radiotherapy on the brain followed by etoposide and cisplatine chemotherapy, then oral vinorelbine. The patient died of progressive disease after 32 weeks.","1466":"The first purpose of this study was to illustrate the contribution of statistical process control for a better security in intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) treatments. This improvement is possible by controlling the dose delivery process, characterized by pretreatment quality control results. So, it is necessary to put under control portal dosimetry measurements (currently, the ionisation chamber measurements were already monitored by statistical process control thanks to statistical process control tools). The second objective was to state whether it is possible to substitute ionisation chamber with portal dosimetry in order to optimize time devoted to pretreatment quality control. At Alexis-Vautrin center, pretreatment quality controls in IMRT for prostate and head and neck treatments were performed for each beam of each patient. These controls were made with an ionisation chamber, which is the reference detector for the absolute dose measurement, and with portal dosimetry for the verification of dose distribution. Statistical process control is a statistical analysis method, coming from industry, used to control and improve the studied process quality. It uses graphic tools as control maps to follow-up process, warning the operator in case of failure, and quantitative tools to evaluate the process toward its ability to respect guidelines: this is the capability study. The study was performed on 450 head and neck beams and on 100 prostate beams. Control charts, showing drifts, both slow and weak, and also both strong and fast, of mean and standard deviation have been established and have shown special cause introduced (manual shift of the leaf gap of the multileaf collimator). Correlation between dose measured at one point, given with the EPID and the ionisation chamber has been evaluated at more than 97% and disagreement cases between the two measurements were identified. The study allowed to demonstrate the feasibility to reduce the time devoted to pretreatment controls, by substituting the ionisation chamber's measurements with those performed with EPID, and also that a statistical process control monitoring of data brought security guarantee. ","1467":"Head and neck squamous cell carcinomas are frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage. Their treatment remains controversial, and has to be multidisciplinary. External beam radiotherapy is a recognized treatment option after radical curative surgery in order to improve local control. Different adjuvant treatment options have been studied in order to improve the outcome of these patients. We review in this paper the different prognostic factors indicating an adjuvant treatment and the interest of treatment intensification in bad prognostic patients.","1468":"Clinical situations requiring protections of ovaries are mainly paediatric irradiations and pre-menopausal pelvic irradiations. The main complication of ovarian irradiation is the induced castration. Ovaries are extremely radiosensitive organs with strong interpersonal variations. The castrative effect of irradiation depends mainly on two factors: patient's age and the dose delivered to ovaries. The surgical technique of ovarian transposition allows to minimize the dose received by ovaries by taking them away, out of irradiation fields; the aim is to exclude them from the volume receiving 5 Gy or more, and if possible from those receiving 2 Gy. This technique becomes integrated into a multidisciplinary approach of conservation of fertility for patients exposed to other cytotoxic treatments.","1469":"To present the national survey patterns in France for breast cancer brachytherapy in 2009. A written questionnaire was sent to the academic and general hospitals and the anticancer centres. The different items were type of institution; breast cancer clinical trial participation; number of breast brachytherapy per year; its indications; material and dose rate used. Among the 76 sent questionnaires, 35 (46 %) answers were available: 9 % of academic hospitals and 50 % of cancer centres performed breast brachytherapy. The number of breast brachytherapy per year ranged between 300 and 350. The indications were boost (100 %), partial breast irradiation (20 %) and second conservative treatment for local recurrence (53 %). The implanted material consisted in needles (27 %) and plastic tubes (73 %). The dose rate was low (50 %), pulsed (25 %) and high (25 %). Breast brachytherapy appears as a validated technique in case of boost but remains under investigation for partial breast irradiation and second conservative treatments. Good clinical practice rules as well as technical and dosimetric guidelines are needed. A cost-effective analysis of breast brachytherapy is warranted. ","1470":"Acute radiation dermatitis is a common side-effect of radiotherapy which often necessitates interruption of the therapy. Currently, there is no general consensus about its prevention or about the treatment of choice. The goal of this work was to focus on optimal methods to prevent and manage acute skin reactions related to radiation therapy and to determine if there are specific topical or oral agents for the prevention of this acute skin reaction. The prevention and the early treatment are the two focus points of the management of the acute radiation dermatitis.","1471":null,"1472":"Although there is very little evidence for direct irradiation of the testes, they may receive significant doses, especially in the treatment of pelvic tumors in adults and in pediatrics. The exocrine function of the testis seems to be more sensitive to radiotherapy. There is a risk of sterility, even after low doses of radiation. In the adult or the child who has reached puberty, we should propose a self-preservation of semen prior to radiotherapy. In pre-pubescent children, the problem is more delicate. In all cases, it is necessary to limit the dose to the testicles without affecting the coverage of tumour volume. Patients and\/or their caregivers should be systematically informed of the risk of infertility related to irradiation.","1473":"The vagina is a virtual cavity involved in sexual reproduction field. Due to its anatomical location, it may be exposed in whole or in part to ionizing radiation in external radiotherapy and\/or brachytherapy of the pelvic region. This review aims to describe the vaginal acute and late side effects due to radiation, probably inadequately reported in the literature. Medline and PubMed literature searches were performed using the keywords \"vaginal--radiotherapy--toxicity\". The acute and late functional changes after external beam radiation consist mainly of drought. Their incidences are poorly described in the literature and the delivered doses even less. Recommendations are non-existent as the normal tissue complication probability (NTCP). Brachytherapy delivers high and heterogeneous doses, making it difficult to estimate the dose. The concomitant administration of chemotherapy appears to be a factor increasing the risk of toxicity. Modern techniques of conformal radiotherapy with modulated intensity appear to have little impact on this body. Only a maximum dose on each third of the vagina appears to be currently proposed to avoid the risk of side effects.","1474":"The anal canal is regarded as an organ at risk more often in pelvis radiation, but also in brachytherapy. Acute or chronic complications depend on its different components and are different from the anal margin or the rectum. The toxicity scale can be the NCI CT C version 3, completed by the tardive toxicity SOMALENT scale. The mean dose and maximal dose are recognized as predictors of complications. The maximum recommended dose despite the paucity of literature is 55 Gy.","1475":"To describe the biochemical failure-free survival (BFFS), GU toxicity and erectile dysfunction in intermediate risk prostate cancer treated with iodine 125 monotherapy (I125). Between October 1994 and October 2007, 1282 patients were treated with I125 at the Hotel Dieu de Quebec. Two hundred patients were intermediate risk prostate cancer. One hundred and fifty-seven had enough follow-up to be evaluated in this study. Biochemical failure-free survival is reported using Phoenix definition. Acute and late GU toxicity was described using the International Prostate Symptoms Score (IPSS) as well as with the rate of bladder catheter. Erectile dysfunction was also reported. The mean age of the patients was 65.6 years (S.D.=6 years) and the mean pretreatment PSA was 8.7ng\/ml. About half of the patients (51%) were T2b\/T2c. About 44.6% had a PSA greater than 10 and 4.5% had Gleason score of 7\/10. More than half of the patients received a short course of hormones of less than 6 months for cytoreduction (57.4%). The median follow-up was 60 months. Biochemical failure-free survival at 60-month and 96-month were 87.1% and 81% according to Phoenix definition. The mean IPSS rose from 5 immediately after the implant to 15 1 month after and then slowly decreased to 8 at 24 months. Acute urinary retention with bladder catheter occurred in 10.9% of patients. Only 4.3% presented erectile dysfunction at 5 months post-implant. I125 monotherapy for intermediate risk prostate implant gives biochemical failure-free survivals at 5 years and 8 years comparable to those obtained with high dose external beam radiotherapy. GU toxicity and erectile dysfunction were low and acceptable. Therefore, the use of I125 alone in this group of patients could be presented and discussed with the patient in the waiting of phase III validation. ","1476":"Inverted papilloma (IP) is a rare nasosinusal benign tumour, with epithelium surface inversion to inside the stroma. Extension to intracranial temporal fossa and middle ear has been reported in few cases in the literature. This involvement may be derived from either direct extension from sinonasal cavity via the Eustachian tube or primary middle ear involvement secondary to metaplastic changes of the middle ear mucosa. Here, we report a case of inverted papilloma in a male patient, with multiple recurrences, middle ear and intracranial involvement into the temporal fossa with posterior development of malignancy. This patient had received multiple surgeries and radiotherapy but despite of that, his disease recurred several times. As a conclusion, inverted papilloma is a benign tumour with an aggressive course, tendency to recurrence and progression to malignancy. Intracranial and temporal fossa involvements are rare and the treatment depends of the symptoms and the severity of the disease.","1477":"Highly conformal irradiation techniques are associated with steep gradient doses. Accuracy and reproducibility of delineation are required to avoid geometric misses and to properly report dose-volume effects on organs at risk. Guidelines of the International Commission on Radiation Units have largely contributed to high quality treatments. The ICRU endeavors to collect and evaluate the latest data and information pertinent to the problems of radiation measurement and dosimetry. There remains a need for delineation guidelines and automatic segmentation tools in routine practice. Among these tools, atlas-based segmentation has been shown to provide promising results. The methodology used for head and neck cancer patients is illustrated.","1478":"We retrospectively analyzed anatomoclinic, therapeutic and evolutive particularities of 74 young patients (&lt; or =20 years) with nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated between 1993 and 2005. Initial work-up included a fiberoptic nasofibroscopy with biopsy, tomodensitometry and\/or MRI of nasopharynx and neck, chest X-ray, abdominal ultrasonography and bone scan. Patients were treated with either primary chemotherapy (epirubicin and cisplatin) followed by radiotherapy or concomitant radiochemotherapy (five fluorouracil and cisplatin). Radiotherapy was delivered to a total dose of 70 to 75 Gy to nasopharynx and involved cervical lymph nodes and 50 Gy to the remainder cervical areas. The median age was 16 years. Sixty-three percent of patients had undifferentiated tumors. Sixty-six percent had locally advanced tumor. With a median follow-up of 107 months, one patient presented a local relapse, 24 patients developed distant metastases with a median delay of 7 months. The 5 years overall survival and disease-free survival were 66 and 65 %. Late complications were dominated by dry mouth and endocrine disorders. Pediatric nasopharyngeal carcinoma is characterized by an early metastatic diffusion. Local control is excellent but with severe late toxicities. New techniques of radiotherapy and new molecules of chemotherapy could improve these results. ","1479":"During the French national course of radiotherapy, delineation stations were at disposition for the residents. A comparative study of delineation and doses prescribed for a clinical case of lung carcinoma is reported before and after the completion of a theoretical education. For this comparative study, 120 residents divided in 30 groups, have delineated the case before and after a lecture of radio-anatomy and a presentation of volumes and doses. The software Artiview (Aquilab SAS) was used to calculate the volume ratio (VR), common volume (CV), additional volume (AV), kappa (K) and overlap (OV) between the different volumes of interest. The expansion margins and the prescribed doses were noticed. A comparative study by a test of Student for paired series was performed. The GTV was 89.1cm(3) for the expert. It was 103.4 cm(3) (59.9-215.2 cm(3)) before versus 99.5 cm(3) (39.7-202.3 cm(3)) after the teaching intervention for participants. For GTV, comparison index were respectively before and after the intervention 1.16 cm(3) (0.7-2.4 cm(3)) and 1.1 cm(3)(0.5-2.3 cm(3)) for the VR (p=0.53), 78.4 cm(3) (58.9-91.8 cm(3)) and 76.4 cm(3) (40.2-92.1cm(3)) for the CV (p=0.27), 28.8 cm(3) (7.1-62 cm(3)) and 27.8 cm(3) (9.1-59.6 cm(3)) for the AV (p=0.7). OV and K were respectively 0.58 and 0.73 cm(3) before and after education. The median margin prescribed to obtain CTV from GTV was 6mm (5-10mm), no change was noticed after the course. The expert prescribed a 6mm margin. The median margin prescribed by the participants to obtain PTV from CTV was 7 mm (3-15 mm) before the course and 5mm (3-15 mm) afterwards, versus 5mm for the expert. The dose prescribed by the expert was 66 Gy on PTV. The dose was 66.2 Gy (60-70 Gy) before and 66.5 Gy (64-70 Gy) after course for residents. No significant volume modification was found after the educational course. We noticed however an adaptation of the margins and a tendency to increase the prescribed dose as well as a reduction of the delineated volume. Good quality of the initial delineation could explain the absence of significant progress after education. ","1480":"Our study aims at evaluating the cost of pulsed dose-rate (PDR) brachytherapy with optimized dose distribution versus traditional treatments (iridium wires, cesium, non-optimized PDR). Issues surrounding reimbursement were also explored. This prospective, multicentre, non-randomised study conducted in the framework of a project entitled \"Support Program for Costly Diagnostic and Therapeutic Innovations\" involved 21 hospitals. Patients with cervix carcinoma received either classical brachytherapy or the innovation. The direct medical costs of staff and equipment, as well as the costs of radioactive sources, consumables and building renovation were evaluated from a hospital point of view using a microcosting approach. Subsequent costs per brachytherapy were compared between the four strategies. The economic study included 463 patients over two years. The main resources categories associated with PDR brachytherapy (whether optimized or not) were radioactive sources (1053euro) and source projectors (735euro). Optimized PDR induced higher cost of imagery and dosimetry (respectively 130euro and 367euro) than non-optimized PDR (47euro and 75euro). Extra costs of innovation over the less costly strategy (iridium wires) reached more than 2100euro per treatment, but could be reduced by half in the hypothesis of 40 patients treated per year (instead of 24 in the study). Aside from staff, imaging and dosimetry, the current hospital reimbursements largely underestimated the cost of innovation related to equipment and sources. ","1481":"The main objective was to assess contributions and limits of surgical clips combined with computed tomography to define the tumor bed after conservative treatment of breast cancer. This retrospective observational study enrolled 16 patients treated by lumpectomy with surgical clips placed in the tumor bed. We assessed the difficulties in localizing the tumour bed based on collected data (i.e. clinical description, mammography, ultrasound examination, surgical procedure and pathology data). The clip's number and localization, and the volumes of the boost were also analyzed. There was no preoperative occurrence of localization in 57 % of cases for palpable tumours, and in 13 % of cases where the lesion was subclinical. The collected data did not allow establishing a precise localization. The mean number of surgical clips per patient was 4 (range 1-9), and the delineation of the target volumes by radiation oncologists was not standardized. Oncoplastic techniques may produce difficulties in the localization of tumour bed. The placement of surgical clips by the surgeon is helpful, primarily when oncoplastic techniques are used. In many situations, these clips may cause problems of interpretation. In order to optimize the delineation of the boost, we propose a multidisciplinary approach and methodology to be used at the Henri Becquerel Cancer Centre. ","1482":"","1483":"Desmoplastic small round cell tumors are rare aggressive cancers of adolescence and early adulthood. It has recently been separated from other small round cell tumors because of its pathological characteristics and clinical features. They are usually intra-abdominal tumors affecting young people and have classically been associated with a bad prognosis. However, in recent years there have been reports on desmoplastic small round cell tumors affecting other body regions, including the paratesticular area. We report the case of a 27-year-old male who consulted on a progressive enlargement of the right hemiscrotum. He referred no previous urological symptoms and had no systemic symptomatology. Physical examination revealed a round elastic firm 1-cm mass of the epididymis, which was excised. A computed tomography scan showed a para-aortic mass of 1cm. Histological and immunohistochemical diagnosis confirmed a desmoplastic small round cell tumor. The patient received chemotherapy. Today, 6 months after diagnosis the patient remains well and free of disease. Recent reviews on desmoplastic small round cell tumors affecting the paratesticular area have shown a better prognosis for tumors of this origin compared to abdominal ones. We should include this lesion among the differential diagnosis of paratesticular tumors, mainly in children and adolescents.","1484":"Pre-irradiation dental care depends on teeth health, fields and dose of irradiation, compliance to fluorides, cessation of tobacco and psychosocial cofactors. Dental care aims at preventing complications and preserving the quality of life (eating, speech and aesthetics). Approximately 11% of patients do not require any pre-irradiation dental care. Dental complications vary from slight colorations of the teeth to major complication such as osteoradionecrosis. Osteoradionecrosis rates vary from 1 to 9%, and may be decreased by using a 21-day delay between extractions and irradiation, provided that it does not postpone cancer treatment, with a dose-dependent risk (&lt;6% if &lt;40 Gy; 14% between 40 et 60 Gy; &gt; or =20% if &gt;60 Gy). Osteoradionecrosis occurs spontaneously (35%), mostly involves the mandibula (85%).","1485":"In early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC), recent data from both prospective clinical trials and single institutions indicate that local control rates in excess of 88% can be achieved using stereotactic radiotherapy (SRT). Treatment-related toxicity is uncommon when \"risk-adapted\" fractionation schemes are applied, with lower dose per fraction used for larger tumors and when the planning target volume is in the proximity of critical structures. Both the superior outcome and convenience of fewer visits have led to a preference for SRT over conventional radiotherapy in countries such as Japan and the Netherlands. Reports on outcomes of SRT in patients unfit to undergo surgery may underestimate late toxicity as such patients have significant non-cancer related mortality. The evolution of technology has allowed for further improvements in the accuracy and speed of SRT delivery. Recent advances such as on-board imaging and intensity-modulated arc delivery techniques have improved treatment accuracy and tolerability, as well as the confidence of clinicians in applying SRT outside the setting of specialized tertiary institutions. Studies comparing primary surgery with SRT are underway, but the available data are compelling enough to allow SRT to be considered an established treatment option in patients who are aged 75 years and older, and in whom the estimated risks of postoperative mortality rates are high. The clinical development of SRT will be greatly facilitated by improvements in diagnostic procedures for peripheral pulmonary nodules. However, treatment without pathological confirmation may be justified in medically inoperable patients if the risk of malignancy is sufficiently high as to warrant an invasive diagnostic procedure.","1486":"Each technological development of radiotherapy is an example of interaction between physicians and physicists. In the past, it was the case for the first X-rays generators, betatrons and particle accelerators. To date, this is the case for Cyberknives and intensity modulation radiotherapy. In the future, this will be the case for proton- and hadron-therapy. However, in a general tendency of favouring higher radiation energies, leaving the 250kV orthovoltage irradiators and preferring accelerators delivering some tens MeV to reach the deepest tumours, how to consider the anti-cancer applications of synchrotron radiation that provides X-rays in the 10-100keV \"only\"? Since the first approaches developed in the USA in seventies until the last preclinical trials performed at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility of Grenoble, the radiobiological features of the chemoradiotherapy involving synchrotron radiation will be described and analysed throughout a transversal view considering physicochemical bases, biomolecular and cellular mechanisms and results from the preclinical trials in order to provide a general outcome and some eventual transfer perspectives.","1487":"Pre-irradiation dental care depends on teeth health, fields and dose of irradiation, compliance to fluorides, cessation of tobacco and psychosocial cofactors. Dental care aims at preventing complications and preserving the quality of life (eating, speech, and aesthetics). The role of hyperbaric oxygenotherapy for the prevention of osteoradionecrosis after teeth removal on the mandibula in areas receiving 50 Gy or more is still controversial. Medical treatments may be sufficient for early stages of osteoradionecrosis (antibiotics, pain killers, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs as well as clodronate, vitamin E, pentoxifyllin). However, reconstructive surgery should not be delayed in advanced stages of osteoradionecrosis. New irradiation techniques are changing dose distributions and therefore require close collaboration between odonto-stomatologists and radiation oncologists to define the best dental care.","1488":"","1489":"Monte Carlo based treatment planning system are known to be more accurate than analytical methods for performing absorbed dose estimation, particularly in and near heterogeneities. However, the required computation time can still be an issue. The present study focused on the determination of the optimum statistical uncertainty in order to minimise computation time while keeping the reliability of the absorbed dose estimation in treatments planned with electron-beams. Three radiotherapy plans (medulloblastoma, breast and gynaecological) were used to investigate the influence of the statistical uncertainty of the absorbed dose on the target volume dose-volume histograms (spinal cord, intramammary nodes and pelvic lymph nodes, respectively). The study of the dose-volume histograms showed that for statistical uncertainty levels (1 S.D.) above 2 to 3%, the standard deviation of the mean dose in the target volume calculated from the dose-volume histograms increases by at least 6%, reflecting the gradual flattening of the dose-volume histograms. This work suggests that, in clinical context, Monte Carlo based absorbed dose estimations should be performed with a maximum statistical uncertainty of 2 to 3%. ","1490":"Erythropoietin (EPO) is a glycoprotein hormone. This hormone is a growth factor for red blood cells precursors in the bone marrow. The decrease of oxygen partial pressure, a reduced number of erythrocytes caused by bleeding or excessive destruction, or increased tissues oxygen requirements lead to increased secretion of EPO. Its action takes place on bone marrow erythroblastic cells through specific receptors. EPO stimulates the proliferation of red cell precursors stem cells in the bone marrow, thus increasing their production in one to two weeks. The effectiveness of EPO at increasing haemoglobin and improving patients' quality of life has been demonstrated by several studies. However, its use in radiotherapy remains controversial. While tumour hypoxia caused by anaemia is a factor of radio resistance and thus a source of local failure, tumour expression of EPO receptors presents a significant risk for tumour progression and neo-angiogenesis, which would be increased during the administration of EPO. The purpose of this article is to answer the question: is there a place for EPO in combination with radiotherapy in the management of cancer?","1491":"Comparison of three dosimetric techniques of lung tumor delineation to integrate tumor motion during breathing. Nineteen patients with T1-3N0M0 malignant lung tumor were treated with definitive chemoradiotherapy (14 cases) or pre-surgery chemoradiation. Doses were, respectively, 66 and 46Gy. CT-scan for delineation was performed during three phases of breathing: free breathing and deep breath-hold inspiration and expiration. GTV (gross tumor volume) was delineated on the three sequences. The classic technique included GTV from the free-breathing sequence plus a CTV (clinical target volume) margin of 5 to 8mm plus a PTV (planning target volume) margin of 7 to 10mm (including ITV [internal target volume] margin and set-up margin). The gating-like technique included GTV from the deep breath-hold inspiration sequence plus a CTV margin of 5 to 8mm plus a PTV margin of 2mm. The three-volume technique, included GTV as a result of the fusion of GTVs from the three sequences plus a CTV margin of 5 to 8mm plus a PTV margin of 2mm. Dosimetry was calculated for the three PTVs, if possible, with the same fields number and position. Dose constraints and rules were imposed to accept dosimetries: firstly spinal cord maximal dose less than 45Gy, followed by V95 % for PTV greater than or equal to 95 %, and V20 GY(Gy) for lung less than or equal to 30 %, V30 GY(Gy) for lung less than or equal to 20 %. GTVs were not statistically different between the three methods of delineation. PTVs were significantly lower with the gating-like technique. V95% of the PTV were not different between the three techniques. With the classic-, the gating-like- and the 3-volume techniques, dosimetry was considered as acceptable, respectively in 15, 18 and 15 cases. Comparisons of constraint values showed that the gating-like method gave the best results. In the case of pre-operative management, the gating-like method allowed the best results even for the V95% values. However, in the absence of gating device or without the possibility to use it, the 3-volume method allowed to take into account more precisely the organ motion than the classical technique. The 3-volume method can be done. It is a good method to take into account the organ motions. However, the gating-like method gives the best results leading to propose its use even for pre-operative patients with upper tumors. ","1492":"Evaluate the feasibility and toxicity of radiation dose escalation delivered with a single fraction high-dose-rate (HDR) brachytherapy boost followed by external beam radiotherapy for intermediate and high risk localized prostate cancer - a retrospective study. Between December 2004 and December 2008, 61 patients with intermediate risk or high-risk localized prostate cancer received a single 10 Gy fraction of interstitial HDR brachytherapy followed by a 64 Gy course of external beam radiation therapy. Dose volume histograms, conformity index and side effects were systematically analyzed. HDR brachytherapy dosimetric criteria were respected. Early side effects (&lt; or = 3 months after full treatment): 30 % reported grade 2 or grade 3 urinary toxicity and 26 % reported grade 2 or grade 3 bowel toxicity were reported. Late side effects (&gt; 3 months): 12 % reported grade 2 or grade 3 urinary toxicity and 5 % reported grade 2 or grade 3 bowel toxicity were reported. No patients reported any grade 4 late toxicity events. Three months after treatment, 7 % grade 1, 25 % grade 2 and 39 % grade 3 erectile dysfunction were reported. Our monofractionation protocol is an easy technique to implement logistically. Acute and late toxicities are acceptable and comparable to those published by various teams mostly using multifractionation protocols. A longer follow-up is required to assess the effect of this dose escalation protocol on long-term biological control. ","1493":"Stereotactic radiotherapy using the CyberKnife has become a key treatment in the multidisciplinary management of secondary tumours, as well as primary benign or malignant tumours located within or adjacent to vertebral bodies and the spinal cord. The aim of this treatment is to improve local control and clinical response, including previously irradiated cases. In this study, we present the first patients treated with CyberKnife between December 2006 and December 2007 for spinal or paraspinal tumours. The primary aim was to assess the feasibility and tolerance of stereotactic radiotherapy using the CyberKnife. Secondary aims were to establish the short-term local control, to calculate the local progression-free survival and overall survival. Clinical examination and imaging procedures were performed every three months. Response was assessed according to RECIST criteria. During that period, 16 patients were treated with CyberKnife. Thirteen patients had been pre-treated, three of whom had received spinal cord doses considered to be maximal. Three patients did not receive previous irradiation. The median age was 59 (36-74). The most frequent symptoms were pain (n = 8) and motor weakness (n = 4). The median dose was 30 Gy (16-50). The median number of fractions was 3 (1-5). No patient developed acute myelitis. Three patients developed acute reaction. Overall survival at 18 months was 72.4%, with a mean survival of 18.2 months (95% CI: 15.4-20.9). Local progression-free survival at 18 months was 58.4%, with a mean value of 16.9 months (95% CI: 13.6-20.2). The use of stereotactic radiotherapy with CyberKnife represents a major progress in the management of paraspinal tumours. The main advantages are better sparing of the spinal cord and the possibility of increasing the dose to the tumour target volume. ","1494":"Merkel cell carcinoma carcinoma (MCC) or primary cutaneous neuroendocrine carcinoma is a rare and aggressive malignancy affecting elderly. Optimal therapeutic strategy has not yet been established in elderly patients. From March 1996 to March 2007, 29 patients with Merkel cell carcinoma of were treated at the University Hospital of Amiens, France. Adjuvant radiotherapy (RT) was performed for 14 patients (50%) on the tumor bed with margins of 3 to 5cm, an average dose of 46Gy (30-60Gy), by 2Gy per fraction. Ten of them also received RT to the lymph node area at mean dose of 44.3Gy (26-50Gy). Duration of RT was 35 days. A retrospective analysis was conducted to better evaluate survival and prognostic factors. Median overall survival (OS) was 18.9 months (3-122) and the median time to progression (MTP) 5.5 months (1-26). At 5 years, OS for irradiated patients was 47% (IC95: 12-82%) versus 27% (IC95: 5-49%) in cases of surgery alone (p=0.032). The most frequent sites of recurrence were nodal (34.5%), local (24.1%) and metastatic (17.2%). For patients over 70 years, eight (36.5%) were free of disease at last news, 8 (36.5%) had died from cancer and six from other causes (27%). In this subgroup, MTP was 6 months (2-19) and median OS of 19 months (4-87). There was no acute toxicity greater than grade 2. Although limited by a retrospective analysis, this report suggests an advantage of postoperative RT for patients with MCC. It combined low toxicity and improvement of survival. Prospective multicenter trials are needed to clarify and validate the optimal strategy. ","1495":"The standard treatment of high-grade glioma is still unsatisfactory: the 2-year survival after radiotherapy being only 10-25%. A high linear energy transfer (LET) ionising radiotherapy has been used to overcome tumour radioresistance. An overview of the field is needed to justify future prospective controlled studies on carbon ion therapy. A meta-analysis of clinical trials on neutron beam therapy and a literature review of clinical investigations on light ion use in high-grade glioma were carried out. Four randomised controlled trials on neutron beam therapy were retained. The meta-analysis showed a non-significant 6% increase of two-year mortality (Relative risk [RR]=1.06 [0.97-1.15]) in comparison with photon therapy. Two phase I\/II trials on carbon and neon ion therapy reported for glioblastoma 10% and 31% two-year overall survivals and 13.9 and 19.0 months median survivals, respectively. This meta-analysis suggests that neutron beam therapy does not improve the survival of high-grade glioma patients while there is no definitive conclusion yet regarding carbon therapy. The ballistic accuracy and the improved biological efficacy of carbon ions renew the interest in prospective clinical trials on particle beam radiotherapy of glioma and let us expect favourable effects of dose escalation on patients' survival.

Close collaboration between the department of radiation oncology-biophysics and the department of quality and risk management in the same institution allowed to create a multiprofessional and multidisciplinary task force and to make the experience feedback easier. A preliminary risk analysis method was used to identify the generic dangers, the mapping of risks and the specification of the scales of criticality. This method helped to evaluate and to rate each apprehended event. Four scales have been defined: seriousness scale in five levels, likelihood scale in five classes, endeavour scale in four levels and criticality scale in three categories: acceptable (criticality 1) tolerable under control (criticality 2) and unacceptable (criticality 3). Fifty-seven level 1 dangerous situations linked to 78 scenarios of criticality acceptable, tolerable and unacceptable in 24, 44 and 10 cases respectively have been identified in the department of radiotherapy leading to carry out 28 risk reduction actions. The performed risk analysis offered an original frame for a collective thinking among the care providers and contributed to modify their mode of conceiving both security and radioprotection.

However, FU is not well tolerated in a significant proportion of patients. UFT, a fixed combination of the oral FU prodrug tegafur with uracil, is one of the agents used instead of FU in such cases. We retrospectively compared the toxicity, local and distant control and survival rates with FU or oral UFT during concurrent radiotherapy to assess the role of UFT instead of FU. We conducted a retrospective analysis of survival, disease control and toxicity data in 52 patients treated with postoperative chemoradiation following total or subtotal gastrectomy for gastric adenocarcinoma with either FU or UFT between January 2003 and December 2004. Median follow-up was 20 months (range: 3-59), median survival time was 23 (+\/-6.08) months and 1-3 years overall survival (OS) rates were 64.9-39% for all patients. Compared with the UFT regimen, the incidence of treatment interruption was greater with FU (p=0.023), but no significant differences were seen in local control (p=0.40), distant recurrences (p=0.83) and survival rates (p=0.8657) among patients. Concurrent UFT with radiotherapy seems to be a more tolerable and an equally effective regimen in the postoperative treatment of gastric adenocarcinoma when compared to FU. ","1500":"The objective of this work was the study of in vivo dosimetry performed in a series of 54 patients receiving total body irradiation (TBI) at the Salah-Azaiz Institute of Tunis since 2004. In vivo dosimetry measurements were compared to analytically calculated doses from monitor units delivered. The irradiation was conducted by a linear accelerator (Clinac 1800, Varian, Palo Alto, USA) using nominal X-rays energies of 6 MV and 18 MV, depending on the thickness of the patient at the abdomen. The dose was measured by semi-conductors p-type EPD-20. These diodes were calibrated in advance with an ionization chamber \"PTW Farmer\" type of 0.6cm(3) and were placed on the surface of plexiglas phantom in the same TBI conditions. A study of dosimetric characteristics of semi-conductors EPD-20 was carried out as a function of beam direction and temperature. Afterwards, we conducted a comparative analysis of doses measured using these detectors during irradiation to those calculated retrospectively from monitor units delivered to each patient conditioned by TBI. Experience showed that semi-conductors are sensitive to the angle of beam radiation (0-90 degrees ) and the temperature (22-40 degrees C). The maximum variation is respectively 5 and 7%, but in our irradiation conditions these correction factors are less than 1%. The analysis of the results of the in vivo dosimetry had shown that the ratio of the average measured doses and analytically calculated doses at the abdomen, mediastina, right lung and head are 1.005, 1.007, 1.0135 and 1.008 with a standard deviation \"type A\" respectively of 3.04, 2.37, 7.09 et 4.15%. In vivo dosimetry by semi-conductors is in perfect agreement with dosimetry by calculation. However, in vivo dosimetry using semiconductors is the only technique that can reflect the dose actually received instantly by the patient during TBI given the many factors that calculation can not take into account: patient and organs motions and the heterogeneity of the targets. ","1501":"For patients with good urinary function and presenting with a low risk prostate cancer, prostate brachytherapy using iodine implants represents one of the techniques of reference. This retrospective analysis investigates urinary (U), digestive (D) and sexual (S) toxicities and their prognostic factors of duration. From August 2000 to November 2007, 176 patients presenting with prostate adenocarcinoma underwent interstitial brachytherapy. Urinary, digestive and sexual toxicities were classified according to Common toxicities criteria for adverse events, version 3.0 (CTCAE V3.0). For each toxicity (U, D, S), the number of complications U (dysuria, nicturia...), D (proctitis, diarrhea...) and S (sexual dysfunction, loss of libido, ...) was listed and analyzed according to criteria related to the patient, implant, dosimetric data and characteristics of the toxicity. Prognostic factors identified in univariate analysis (UVA) (Log Rank) were further analyzed in multivariate analysis (MVA) (Cox model). With a median follow-up of 26 months (1-87), 147 patients (83.5 %) presented urinary toxicities. Among them, 29.5 % (86 patients) and 2.4 % (seven patients) presented grade 2 and 3 U toxicity respectively. In UVA, urinary grade toxicity greater than or equal to 2 (p=0.037), the presence of initial U symptoms (p=0.027) and more than two urinary toxicities (p=0.00032) were recognized as prognostic factors. The number of U toxicities was the only prognostic factor in MVA (p=0.04). D toxicity accounted for 40.6 % (71 patients). Among them, 3 % (six patients) were grade 2. None were grade 3. Two factors were identified as prognostic factors either in UVA and MVA: the number of D toxicities greater than or equal to 2 (univariate analysis: p=0,00129, multivariate analysis: p=0,002) and age less than or equal to 65 years (univariate analysis: p=0,004, multivariate analysis: p=0,007). Eighty-three patients (47.4 %) presented a sexual toxicity; 26.9 % (49 patients) and 5 % (nine patients) were scored as grade 2 and 3 respectively. A number of seeds greater than 75 (p=0.032) and S grade greater than or equal to 2 (p&lt;0.0001) were recognized as prognostic factors in UVA. S grade was the only prognostic factor in MVA (p=0.0015). The duration of U, D and S toxicity is strongly correlated with a high number of toxicities and the grade of toxicity. This analysis allows for better information given to the patient regarding the duration of the post-treatment complications.

It has the advantage of having no removable support bars and is thicker than a standard table (Exact(EC)) in order to create the appropriate rigidity. The aim of this study was to quantify the beam attenuation caused by the EIC and to evaluate the EIC contribution to on-board image quality improvement. The treatment beam attenuation and the surface-dose of the patient were measured for simple radiation geometries at different gantry angles and for two clinical cases, head and neck and posterior pelvis. The 2D and 3D image quality was analysed. The beam attenuation at 215 degrees was 2.0% to 4.1% for 6 MV and 1.2% to 2.2% for 18 MV according to the EIC part. The dose-surface tripled between the measurement without table and with table into the beam (similar results between EIC and EC). The EIC influence was significative for the posterior pelvic tumor, acceptable for the head and neck case. The EIC showed a clear improvement of the low contrast resolution (visualisation of a 7mm and 1% contrast disk [15mm for the EC]). In order to take into account the beam attenuation, the EIC should be modeled in the treatment planning system. However, the good quality of 3D images obtained with the EIC allows us to easily visualize soft tissues. ","1503":"To describe retrospectively the overall survival, the cancer specific survival and the tumor control in an homogeneous series of patients with epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal treated with definitive radiotherapy; to assess the impact of brachytherapy, chemotherapy and pre-radiotherapy resection on the risk of recurrence. From 1997 to 2007, 57 patients (pts) presenting with an epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal (T1: 14, T2: 33, T3-4: 10, N0: 31, N1: 19, N2: 3, N3: 4, M0: 57) were treated with definitive radiotherapy by the same radiation oncologist. The treatment included an external beam irradiation (EBRT) given to the posterior pelvis (45Gy\/25 fractions) and, six weeks later, a boost delivered with interstitial brachytherapy (37\/57) or external beam irradiation (20\/57). Twelve pts had undergone a surgical resection of the tumour before radiotherapy. A belly board was used for EBRT in 13 pts. A concurrent platinum based chemotherapy was done in 42 pts. The mean follow-up was 57 months. The overall survival rate at 5 years was 89% with a cause specific survival of 96%. Five patients recurred (5-year rate: 12%: four had local relapse (5-year rate: 8%), four had groin recurrence, and distant metastases were seen in two. In univariate analysis, the risk of relapse was higher in patients who had undergone a pre-radiation excision (p=0.018), in those who did not receive chemotherapy (p=0.076) and in those who were irradiated on a belly board (p=0.049). In multivariate analysis, a pre-radiotherapy resection (p=0.084) had an inverse impact on the tumour control reaching the level of statistical significance and the use of a belly board was of marginal influence (p=0.13). Radiotherapy and chemoradiation with cisplatine-based chemotherapy cure a vast majority of patients with epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal. Therapeutic factors that may interfere with the definition of the target volume and the patients' repositioning may decrease the efficacy of radiotherapy. Pre-radiotherapy surgical resection should be avoided. ","1504":"The work presented herein rests on the study of the Varian EPID aS500-II and the Image Acquisition system IAS3. We assessed the dosimetric performance of this EPID for measurements and quality assurance of enhanced dynamic wedge profiles and wedge factors. We evaluated the dosimeter properties using the integrated asynchronous mode of acquisition in treatments with enhanced dynamic wedges (EDW). We studied the performance, stability and the reproducibility in measurements of the transmission factors and profiles of the fields with dynamic wedges. EPID profiles were compared to the \"Profiler Sun Nuclear\" diode array and PTW ion chamber. Analytical functions were developed in order to correct EDW profiles. The dependence of EPID measurements on wedge direction, beam dimensions and source to EPID distance was assessed. The backscatter produced by the \"exact arm\" was evaluated; EPID profiles depended on the EDW direction and on the detector source distance. Wedge factors were determined using this detector and compared to the ion chamber response, differences were all within 1 %. Two empirical correction functions were developed to produce EPID wedge profiles that correspond to diode for all wedge angles and energies depending on the wedge direction. The EPID is highly suited to regular measurement of EDW due to the reproducibility of the EPID-measured wedge factors and profiles.

In the next future they would modify the approach of cancers. In this context, the molecular imaging of the hypoxia and especially the (18)Ffluoromisonidazole TEP ([(18)F]-MISO TEP) can give supplementary information allowing the mapping of hypoxic regions within the tumour. Because of the links, which exist between tumour hypoxia and treatment resistance of very numerous cancers, this information can have an interest, for determination of prognosis as well as for the delineation, volumes to be irradiated. Head and neck tumours are doubtless those for which the literature gives the most elements on the therapeutic impact of tumour hypoxia. Targeted therapies, based on hypoxia, already exist and the contribution of the molecular imaging could be decisive in the evaluation of the impact of such treatment. Molecular imaging of brain tumours remains to be developed. The potential contributions of the [(18)F]-MISO TEP for the care of these patients need to be confirmed.

With the emergence of news techniques such as conformational radiotherapy, intensity modulated radiation therapy or stereotactic radiation therapy, the definition of target volumes was of great importance. The recommendations for the target volumes definition have been defined in the ICRU 50 and 62 reports, without any guidelines for volume delineation. Among the uncertainties that may influence the outcome after irradiation, the intra- and interobservers variations in delineation are the most important. Many teams have offered guidelines or atlases to homogenize these volumes and reduce these variations related to medical intervention. The aim of this paper is to present the main recommendations.","1511":"Radiation therapy improves survival in high-grade gliomas but most patients relapse and usually within radiation fields. This may be due to uncertainties in target delineation and difficulties in identifying radioresistant regions for dose escalation. The use of T1 and T2-weighted magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) coregistration on the planning CT improves the target volume definition but magnetic resonance spectroscopic imaging (MRSI) and other types of metabolic and functional imaging (perfusion MRI, diffusion-weighted MRI, positron emission tomography (PET) imaging) may give useful additional information for target delineation. This article focuses on the potential of each imaging modality: assessment of response to treatment, detection of abnormalities not seen on MRI, predictive value for the site of local relapse. The incorporation of such techniques may improve target volume definition.","1512":"In Western countries, about 25% of breast cancers (BC) occur in women older than 70 years old. Local control is a crucial step to cure disease, because locoregional relapse (LRR) is a major risk factor of subsequent metastases. After mastectomy, radiotherapy (RT) confirmed a very high value (regardless of age) in several trials and meta-analyses, especially in case of high LRR risk factors (i.e. axillary nodal involvement). Globally, RT reduces LRR rates by 60-70% and also increases long-term survival rates by 8-9%. After breast conserving surgery, several trials and meta-analyses confirmed that RT decreases 10-year local recurrence rates from 20-25 to 5-8%. RT replacement by hormonal treatment leads to a significantly higher LRR rate. Hypofractionated RT schemes could usefully apply to elderly people, but partial breast irradiation techniques are still under investigation. Finally, all elderly fitted women should receive adjuvant RT according to general guidelines with optimal technique in order to avoid cardiotoxicity. Indeed, under-treatment has an unfavourable effect on long-term survival.","1513":"The recent progresses performed in imaging, computational and technological fields bring new opportunities to achieve high precision radiation dose delivery. However, IMRT requires a particular attention at the target delineation step to avoid inadequate dosage to TVs\/OARs. In this context, the biological information provided by PET might advantageously complete CT-Scan to refine the target delineation in HNSCC and lung cancer. Integrating PET into the treatment planning however requires the use and validation of accurate and reproducible segmentation methods, which adequately integrate the PET image properties such as the blur effect and the high level of noise. In this context, we developed specific tools, i.e. edge-preserving filters for denoising and deconvolution algorithms for deblurring that allowed the detection of gradient intensity peaks. Our gradient-based method has been validated on phantom and patient materials, and proved to be more accurate than threshold-based approaches. With this tool in hand, we demonstrated that the use of FDG-PET resulted in smaller TVs than the CT-based TVs, on both pre- and per-treatment images, and significantly improved the dose distributions to the TVs\/OARs. This opens avenues for dose escalation strategies that might potentially improve the tumor local control.","1514":"Stereotactical radiotherapy is a very high precision procedure, limited to radiosurgery since a long time. Technologic progress permitted to develop radiotherapy in stereotactical conditions, leading to a lot of innovations. Previously indicated for cerebral pathologies, this procedure is now developed for extracerebral locations. In pediatrics, stereotactical radiotherapy is still limited, delivered precociously, due to the possibility of long-term late effects that needs to be to addressed. This review reports the different useful conditions, technical evolutions, and the current validated pediatric indications, with differences from adults, and future directions. Current state of pediatric stereotactical radiotherapy used in France is presented.","1515":"Traditionally, prescription and treatment planning in intracavitary brachytherapy for cervix cancer have used either reference points (mainly points A and B) or reference isodoses (60Gy according to ICRU recommendations) to report doses to the target volume. Doses to critical organs were reported at bladder and rectum ICRU points. This practice has been supported by a long-standing clinical experience that has yielded an acceptable therapeutic ratio. The recent development of imaging has contributed to the improvement in target and organs at risk knowledge. In 2005 and 2006, GEC-ESTRO recommendations publications on 3-D based image brachytherapy have defined the different volumes of interest. These recommendations have been validated with intercomparison delineation studies. With the concomitant development of remote after-loading projectors, provided with miniaturized sources, it is now possible to plan radiation doses by adjusting dwell positions and relative dwell time values. These procedures allow better coverage of the targets while sparing OAR. The recent literature data evidence a significant improvement in local control with no increase in complications. Further studies are needed to better define the dose recommended in both tumour and organs at risk. This is one of the goals of the European study on MRI-guided brachytherapy in locally advanced cervical cancer (EMBRACE) protocol.","1516":"To present to the radiation oncologist the main advances in prostate cancer in the last year A review of the main congress in uro-oncology (ASCO, ASTRO, AUA, EAU) and international literature The increase in the incidence of prostate cancer without increasing in mortality must be a signal for oncologist to propose active surveillance to the patients without bad prognostic factors. Use of biomarkers could probably facilitate the selection of patients needing treatment. After prostatectomy, adjuvant radiotherapy could decrease the biochemical relapse rate but also the risk of distant metastasis, particularly for pT3 R1 patients; but the optimal time to deliver this post-operative radiotherapy is discussed: immediately after surgery or delayed in case of PSA relapse (&gt; or = 0,2 ng\/ml). For locally advanced disease, combination of radiotherapy and long-term androgen deprivation improved survival over hormonal treatment alone. But duration of androgen deprivation must be adapted to the comorbidities of the patient because of the risk of metabolic syndrome. The value of dose escalation in association with hormonal treatment must be defined. Important advances in prostate cancer management have been made during the last months, but inclusion of patients into on-going prospective studies is still important to continue to improve the therapeutic results. ","1517":"Cancer is a disease that predominantly occurs in older patients who represent a quarter of the population in western countries. Numerous types of cancer are observed in elderly people. Radiotherapy is one of the most powerful treatment against cancer. Most of published studies have demonstrated feasibility of radiotherapy in curative or palliative intent whatever cancer types are considered. Complete geriatric assessment and a multidisciplinary approach are the key points. The purpose of this review is to highlight sights of radiation oncology specifically related to aging. Particular emphasis is placed on logistic and technical aspects of radiation, as dose, irradiated volume and fractionation.","1518":"The aim of the present study was to evaluate whether angiogenic parameters as assessed by transvaginal color Doppler ultrasound and by enhanced cervix ultrasound may predict prognostic factors of stage IB greater than 4 cm and II cervical cancer treated by radiochemotherapy. A total of 40 patients with histologically proven advanced stage invasive cervical cancer will be evaluated by color Doppler, contrast ultrasound, and MRI before radiotherapy, after the second chemotherapy cycle and prior to surgery. Subjective assessment of the amount of vessels within the tumor (scanty-moderate or abundant) and resistance index (RI) will be recorded for Doppler, enhancement and washout period will be studied after injection of SonoVue for contrast ultrasound. All patients will have radical hysterectomy and pelvic lymph node dissection. Comparison with MRI results will be done. The main parameter studied will be persistence of tumor cells in the analysis of the radical hysterectomy. We expected to correlate contrast parameters with persistent disease in order to confirm ultrasound parameters that will be useful to monitor radiochemotherapy and to predict therapeutic answer of such treatment.","1519":"The treatment of advanced cervix is concomitant radiochemotherapy. Local prognosis and global survival depend on tumoral volume, locoregional extension and radio sensitivity of the lesion. This one is function of tumoral hypoxia, tumoral interstitial pressure and existence of an anaemia. DCE-MRI allows to quantify pilot vascular parameters of the first two factors. Combined analysis: tumoral volume, anaemia and vascular parameters before and in the course of treatment allows a strong correlation with the risk of local recurrence and global survival.","1520":"Medulloblastoma is the most frequent childhood brain tumor (30%) but account only for less than 1% of adult brain tumor. The overall survival increased significantly during the last two decades with 80% of long survivors at five years whatever the stage. Most children who survive have significant neurocognitive sequelae. All children are included in national and international prospective studies which propose risk-adapted radiation therapy and chemotherapy after surgery. Quality control of radiotherapy leads to reduce significantly the risk of recurrence and has an impact on survival. Risks of late toxicity should be taken into account at the time of the treatment. Due to the rarety in adult population, no prospective studies and few data about late effects are available. Adult medulloblastoma is a therapeutic challenge and their therapeutic strategies are similar to pediatric protocols. In order to improve the understanding of adult disease and to homogenize the treatment, National Cancer Institute (INCa) stimulated the creation of web conference to discuss each case prospectively and to propose a protocol of treatment. A better comprehension of biological processes and abnormal cellular signalling pathways involved in medulloblastoma pathogenesis had led toward a new prognostic classification to adapt the therapeutic strategy and gives hope of new therapeutic tools.","1521":"The development of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and intensity modulated therapy (IMRT) has enabled high dose radiation to be directed to tumors, this however subject to a perfect demarcation of the tumoral volume and the anatomical structures to be saved. At the same time, imaging modalities have improved their ability to demonstrate the location and the extension of tumors. The precise location of the target volume and the prediction of the dose absorbed by the tumor thus become an essential stage of the planning of the treatment. This planning is mostly determined on CT pictures. The technique usually used is a non enhanced CT allowing a location of the tumor by its mass effect mass or by its spontaneous difference of density from the adjacent structures. However, the clear visualization of the tumoral volume remains sometimes difficult for small-sized tumors or those with limited contrast with regard to surrounding tissues. This lack of contrast represents a source of variability for the demarcation of the target volume which has been highlighted in numerous papers. Tumors must be then localized by correlation with pictures made at the diagnosis time by other imaging modalities, essentially the MRI and the PET. This approach answers the concept of multimodality diagnosis which resumes the principle of complementarity of the various techniques. Every technique indeed brings, according to its physical principle, one or several specific information. It is advisable from then to clarify the contribution of every used imaging modality, this according to the pathologies and their localizations.","1522":"The problem of the oncogeriatrics is a real challenge for next decades. More than 60% of the patients presenting a cancer in France are more than 65 years old. Indeed, the care services of the old patients affected by cancer require skills of both medical disciplines: geriatrics and oncology. It requires a culture sharing between these two fundamentally transverse specialities. A lot of progresses have to be made, even if this stake has really been considered in our country, in particular because of the implementation of a unique oncogeriatics organization within the French National Cancer Institute (INCA), but also by the structuring of a workgroup within the French Society of Geriatrics and Gerontology.","1523":"Since its introduction in clinical practice in the 1990's, positron emission tomography (PET), usually with (18)F-fluoro-2-deoxy-D-glucose ((18)F-FDG), has become an important imaging modality in patients with cancer. For cervix carcinoma, FDG-PET is significantly more accurate than computed tomography (CT) and is recommended for loco-regional lymph node and extrapelvic staging. The metabolic dimension of the technique provides additional prognostic information. Ongoing studies now concentrate on more advanced clinical applications, such as the planning of radiotherapy, the response evaluation after the induction of therapy, the early detection of recurrence. Technical innovations, such as PET cameras with better spatial resolution and hybrid positron emission tomography\/computed tomography (PET-CT), available now on the whole territory, provide both anatomic and metabolic information in the same procedure. From the point of view of biological metabolism, new radiopharmaceutical probes are being developed. Those hold promise for future refinements in this field. This article reviews the current applications of FDG-PET in patients with cervix cancer.","1524":"Approximately 40-50% of children with cancer will be irradiated during their treatment. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) by linear accelerator or helical tomotherapy improves dose distribution in target volumes and normal tissue sparing. This technology could be particularly useful for pediatric patients to achieve an optimal dose distribution in complex volumes close to critical structures. The use of IMRT can increase the volume of tissue receiving low-dose radiation, and consequently carcinogenicity in childhood population with a good overall survival and long period of life expectancy. This review will present the current and potential IMRT indications for cancers in childhood, and discuss the benefits and problems of this technology aiming to define recommendations in the use of IMRT and specific doses constraints in pediatry.","1525":"Measurement of absorbed dose in target volume is widely considered to be an important tool for quality assurance in external radiotherapy. The aims of this work were to measure the entrance dose for patient treated for head and neck tumors and to compare this measured dose with the dose calculated. Twenty patients were evaluated. Initially, the measurements were performed on a polystyrene phantom in order to calibrate diodes in terms of entrance dose and to determinate appropriate correction factors. In vivo entrance dosimetry check was performed for these patients treated for head and neck tumors in (60)Co gamma-rays. For the entrance dose evaluation over 100 field measurements, the mean deviation between the measured dose and the calculated dose was equal to 0.12% and the standard deviation was 1.84%. The deviation was less than 3% in 95% of measurements. Large deviation (more than 5%) was observed in one case. Simple in vivo dose measurements are an additional safeguard against major set-up errors and calculation or transcription errors that were missed during pretreatment chart check. ","1526":"Discuss the place of radiotherapy given in a curative intent in elderly patients with localised prostate cancer according to complications, local control, survival observed in a specific and a review of the literature. The cohort consisted of 65 males aged 80 or more with localised prostate cancer who choose radiotherapy as a curative modality. Twelve radiotherapy centres affiliated to the Rare Cancer Network participated to the study. The retrospective analysis was carried out on immediate and late side-effects, biological free of relapse survival and global survival. Multivariate analysis took into account the comorbidities, the initial prostatic specific antigen (PSA) value, the Gleason score and the therapeutic modalities. From January 1990 to December 2000, 65 patients were included into the cohort. Mean age was 81 years. The specific series consisted of 10 T1, 40 T2 and 15 T3 N0M0. Median follow up was 65 months. Immediate and late complications were comparable to those described in younger patients who received a similar irradiation. There were no negative impact of the treatment on disease free survival and global survival. Recent literature did suggest analogous results. Radiation therapy with a curative intent should not be systematically withheld in elderly patients with localised prostate cancer. ","1527":"The MEAH, a French national agency working on health services organization, has led a two-year campaign on safety improvement in radiotherapy centers. The pilot project involved three voluntary French cancer centers in 2005 and 2006. Building on the results of this project, a roll-out campaign has been launched, involving more than 50 additional cancer centers from 2007 and on. This paper presents the results of experiences of these campaigns. Notably, the axes of improvement chosen by professionals, such as risk analysis or use of checklists are discussed.","1528":"Since 10 years, the combination of chemoradiotherapy has become a standard of treatment of the advanced localized cervical cancer. Two systematic reviews of the literature (including the results of the different clinical trials) have already been published. The aim of this article is to present the results of the recent meta-analysis based on individual patient data and to discuss the perspectives. This meta-analysis was rigorously designed: trials selected had the same control arm with the same radiotherapy without concomitant chemotherapy, the definition of the primary outcome (overall survival) was homogeneous and analysis was made in intent to treat. The results confirm the advantage in overall survival in favor of the chemoradiotherapy with an absolute 5-year overall survival benefit of 6% (60-66%) and 8% of 5-year disease-free survival (50-58%). Interestingly, even if cisplatin seems to be the most active drug, a significant advantage is also observed with no platinum chemotherapy. A polychemotherapy is not more active than a monochemotherapy and there was a suggestion of a difference in the size of the survival benefit with tumor stage. Larger benefits were seen for the few trials in which additional chemotherapy was administered after chemoradiotherapy, but results have to be confirmed by other clinical trials. Late toxicity was not well evaluated and a long-term follow-up of the patients is important to assess the real incidence of long-term side effects of the chemoradiotherapy and the impact on quality of life. New strategies combining new chemotherapy protocols or targeted therapy with radiation are promising but have to be evaluated in comparative clinical trials before use in routine.","1529":"The registration of multimodality images to help the drawings of the targets is often used. Today, there is no quality control well known for this tool. This article described the methods for registration and the criteria for validation. In the other hand, the routine practice of centre Oscar Lambret with mutual information and visual validation only is described.","1530":"Angiogenesis is central to cancer research. Recent progresses in understanding its mechanisms have enabled the development of therapies that inhibit this process. Many molecules have shown a synergistic effect in combination with irradiation in preclinical studies, and several are being tested in phase I or II. This effect could be explained by a transient normalization of tumor vasculature, leading to improve tumor oxygenation and thus greater radiosensitivity. Although promising, many questions remain about the dose, optimal sequences of the association.","1531":"Neuroendocrine carcinoma with large cells is a slightly different tumor from the high rank of malignity. We report a case of breast localization in a 28-year-old patient. It is a locally advanced classified T4dN1M0 tumor that required neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The clinical answer was 75% of the level of the tumor. A standard surgery mastectomy with axillary lymph node dissection was realized, followed by external radiotherapy. The anatomopathologic and the immuno-histochemical study of the operational part confirmed the diagnosis of neuroendocrine carcinoma with large cells expressing the progesterone receptor. The patient is subjected to adjuvant hormonal treatment. After a 12 months retreat, a complete remission is maintained. Considering the scarcity of neuroendocrine carcinoma with large cells of the breast, the therapeutic standard is not yet available and the forecast remains difficult to determine.","1532":"Since 2007, the Centre Alexis-Vautrin Cancer Institute in Nancy began its safety and quality assurance management policy in the department of radiation oncology. This development induced a collaborative workflow between the quality unit and the department of radiation oncology, with a definition of the responsibilities. The quality unit provides its methodology for the quality assurance, the professionals of the radiation oncology department their expertise. In parallel, a quality referee was nominated in the radiation oncology department to implement the projects for improvement, linked with the quality assurance unit, and under the control of the radiation oncology department staff.","1533":"Evaluation of the results of perioperative interstitial brachytherapy with low dose-rate (LDR) Ir-192 in the treatment of keloid scars. We performed a retrospective analysis of 73 histologically confirmed keloids (from 58 patients) resistant to medicosurgical treated by surgical excision plus early perioperative brachytherapy. All lesions were initially symptomatic. Local control was evaluated by clinical evaluation. Functional and cosmetic results were assessed in terms of patient responses to a self-administered questionnaire. Median age was 28 years (range 13-71 years). Scars were located as follows: 37% on the face, 32% on the trunk or abdomen, 16% on the neck, and 15% on the arms or legs. The mean delay before loading was four hours (range, 1-6h). The median dose was 20Gy (range, 15-40Gy). Sixty-four scars (from 53 patients) were evaluated. Local control was 86% (follow-up, 44.5 months; range, 14-150 months). All relapses occurred early - within 2 years posttreatment. At 20 months, survival without recurrence was significantly lower when treated lengths were more than 6cm long. The rate was 100% for treated scars below 4.5cm in length, 95% (95% CI: 55-96) for those 4.5-6cm long, and 75% (95% CI: 56-88) beyond 6cm (p=0.038). Of the 35 scars (28 patients) whose results were reassessed, six remained symptomatic and the esthetic results were considered to be good in 51% (18\/35) and average in 37% (13\/35) (median follow-up, 70 months; range, 16-181 months). Early perioperative LDR brachytherapy delivering 20Gy at 5mm reduced the rate of recurrent keloids resistant to other treatments and gave good functional results. ","1534":"A retrospective analysis of risk factors for late neurological toxicity after nasopharyngeal carcinoma radiotherapy. Between 1993 and 2004, 239 patients with non metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma were treated by radiotherapy associated or not to chemotherapy. Radiotherapy was delivered with two modalities: hyperfractionated for 82 patients and conventional fractionation for 157 patients. We evaluated the impact of tumour stage, age, gender, radiotherapy schedule and chemotherapy on neurological toxicity. After a mean follow-up of 107 months (35-176 months), 21 patients (8.8%) developed neurological complications, such as temporal necrosis in nine cases, brain stem necrosis in five cases, optics nerve atrophy in two cases and myelitis in one case. Five- and ten-year free of toxicity survival was 95 and 84% respectively. Young patients had greater risk of temporal necrosis, and hyperfractionated radiotherapy was associated with a significantly higher risk of neurological complications (14.6% vs 5.7%, p=0.02). On multivariate analysis, hyperfractionation and age were insignificant. Late neurological toxicity after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma was rare. Younger age and hyperfractionation were considered as risk factors of neurological toxicity in our study. ","1535":"While indications of modulated intensity radiation therapy (IMRT) are perfectly defined in head and neck and prostate cancer patients, this technique remains under evaluation for gynaecologic tumours. The implementation of conformal 3D radiotherapy in the late 1990s has been the first important step for optimisation of treatment of cervix carcinomas, as it permitted a better target coverage with a significant reduction of the bladder dose. However, this technique often leads to an irradiation of a larger volume of rectum in locally advanced stages and could only spare a limited amount of intestine. IRMT is one of the optimisation methods potentially efficient for a better sparing of digestive tract during irradiation of cervix carcinomas. The aim of this literature review is to provide the arguments supporting this hypothesis, and to define the place of this technique for dose escalation.","1536":"Actually, radiation-therapy indications in non-Hodgkin's lymphoma tends to decrease in favour of exclusive chemotherapy, especially in aggressive localized diseases. In this situation, PET scan imaging would be a promising tool to identify candidates to complementary radiotherapy after initial chemotherapy. To decrease long-term morbidity, radiation doses and treated volumes should be as small as possible. New radiation technologies could contribute to reduce this risk as well. However, there are still indications for radiotherapy. Radiation therapy could be delivered with curative-intent in localized indolent non-Hodgkin's lymphoma and could be helpful in symptom relief in advanced or relapsed indolent lymphoma.","1537":"For the second year, the French Radiotherapy Database presents information from French radiation oncology centers. Among 179 centers, 159 have participated (90 %). The number of accelerators increased from 371 to 384 between 2006 and 2007, 11 % of these machines are more than 15 years old. On average, centers are open 50 hours per week for treatment and 9.5 % more for maintenance. The lack of dedicated CT remains a difficulty: 158 from 159 centers have an access to a CT, but only 50 % have a dedicated scanner. There is no progress compared to 2006. The proportion of centers having a MU double calculation system has increased from 51 to 58 %. Two thirds of centers do not implement in vivo dosimetry. The activity is stable around 190 000 treatments per year. Three-dimension conformal radiotherapy is used for more than half of treatments in 77.2 % of private centers and 50 % of public hospitals. Intensity modulated radiotherapy remains rarely used. The number of radiation oncologists and technologists remains stable. The number of radiophysicists has increased from 7.6 %. Despite some progress, the difficulties of this speciality persist in France and are equally distributed across all regions, and between private and public centers. In 2009, the French Society for Radiation Oncology and the associated partners will continue this survey, which interest is recognized by both professionals and health administrations.","1538":"The kV cone beam CT (CBCT) consists of an X-ray tube and a flat panel detector placed perpendicularly to the treatment beam, allowing the acquisition of hundreds of projections in one rotation of the gantry about the patient. Available in all new linear accelerators, the CBCT provides volumetric imaging in treatment position proving the realization of image- and dose-guided radiotherapy (IGRT and DGRT). The clinical indications correspond to mobile tumours irradiating with high precision required techniques, such as stereotactic, hypofractionated or high dose radiotherapy. The clinical experience is still very limited and concerns mainly prostate, head and neck and lung tumours. The registration and treatment protocols are briefly described. Quality control and training are major issues. CBCT based IGRT is a new technique which needs to be optimized. However, it should provide significant clinical benefit in combination with intensity modulated radiotherapy and new imaging modalities for target delineation.","1539":"Increasing studies show the central role of the tumor microenvironment, and more particularly the angiogenesis, in the response to anticancer treatment such as radiotherapy. Thus the association of angiogenesis inhibitors to radiotherapy is a strategy whose concept is based on several mechanisms of actions, such as the implication of the angiogenic factors in the control of tumor radiosensitivity, the regulation of the tumor radiosensitivity by that of the endothelial cells, the induction of hypoxia by the tumor angiogenesis, the induction of HIF-1alpha by irradiation and finally the importance of the angiogenic factors in the tumor stem cells survival, known to be radioresistant. These mechanisms will be detailed in this article as well as several clinical trials associating these inhibitors with radiotherapy.","1540":"To determine the safety and radiation-enhancing effect of sodium glycididazole in laryngeal squamous cell carcinoma (stage T3-4,N0-3,M0) with conventional radiotherapy. Patients with locoregional advanced laryngeal cancer (stage T3-4,N0-3,M0) were included: group 1(control, n=30)were not administered of sodium glycididazole; group 2 (test, n=30) received sodium glycididazole at a dose of 700 mg\/m(2) intravenous infusion 30 minutes before radiotherapy three times a week. Surrogate end-points of efficacy were tumor and nodal size. Safety parameters were vomiting, nausea, mucositis, laryngeal edema, esophagus and skin reaction, dysphagia, dyspnea, neurological deficit. Patients were evaluated weekly during treatment for 7 weeks and thereafter monthly for 3 months. In the test, the overall response rate was 88.89% (95%CI, 71.00-97.00%) at 7 weeks and 92.59% (95%CI, 76.00 to 99.00%) at 1 month of follow-up. In the control, the overall response rate was 62.5% (95%CI, 41.00 to 81.00%) at 7 weeks and 58.33% (95%CI, 37.00 to 78.00%) at 1 month of follow-up. The short-term locoregional response rate was better in the test group at 7 weeks (p=0.027) and at 1 month (p=0.005) of follow-up. The test group had significantly more nausea and vomiting in weeks 1 (p=0.047), 2 (p=0.007), and 3 (p=0.01) of treatment. The study indicates sodium glycididazole is an effective radiation-enhancing agent that improves short-term locoregional control and is well tolerated in patients with locoregionally advanced laryngeal cancer. ","1541":"The optimal timing and extent of neck dissection in the context of chemoradiation for head and neck cancer remains controversial. For some institutions, it is uncertain whether neck dissection should still be performed upfront especially for cystic nodes. For others, neck dissection can be performed after chemoradiation and can be omitted for N1 disease as long as a complete response to chemoradiation is obtained. The question is debated for N2 and N3 disease even after a complete response as the correlation between radiological and clinical assessment and pathology may not be reliable. Response rates are greater than or equal to 60% and isolated neck failures are less than or equal to 10% with current chemoradiation protocols. Some therefore consider that systematic upfront or planned neck dissection would lead to greater than or equal to 50% unnecessary neck dissections for N2-N3 disease. Positron-emission tomography (PET) scanning to assess treatment response and have shown a very high negative predictive value of greater than or equal to 95% when using a standard uptake value of 3 for patients with a negative PET at four months after the completion of therapy. These data may support the practice of observing PET-negative necks. More evidence-based data are awaited to assess the need for neck dissection on PET. Selective neck dissection based on radiological assessment and peroperative findings and not exclusively on initial nodal stage may help to limit morbidity and to improve the quality of life without increasing the risk of neck failure. Adjuvant regional radiation boosts might be discussed on an individual basis for aggressive residual nodal disease with extracapsular spread and uncertain margins but evidence is missing. Medical treatments aiming at reducing the metastatic risk especially for N3 disease are to be evaluated.","1542":"Pediatric tumors still represent a formidable challenge despite the considerable therapeutical advances that have been reported for the past 30 years. This is largely related with the untowards side-effects of local therapy that are still acknowledged as the \"price for cure\". In this setting, Proton therapy a sophisticated radiotherapeutical modality seems to represent a real breakthrough due to its unique ability to spare close and distant normal organs compared with modern photons techniques. We summarize in this paper current clinical and dosimetrical evidences including an update of the Orsay series on 108 children.","1543":"In oncogeriatric patients, severe malnutrition is associated with increased morbidity and mortality, nosocomial infections, radiotherapy or chemotherapy toxicities, and decreased of quality of life. Therefore, systematic screening and care of malnutrition is mandatory, in accordance with the French guidelines in 2007. Now, dietary counselling should be purposed systematically in malnourish patients and when radiotherapy or radiochemotherapy are considered. Oral supplementation by specific diet (immune-enhancing diets) should be used with cautions, and actually, reserved only in digestive neoplasms and surgery. In cases of severely malnourished patients or if dietary counselling suffers a setback, enteral nutrition should be recommended. In radiotherapy or chemotherapy, used parenteral nutrition is associated with an increase in infectious complications. Artificial nutrition should not be used when Karnofski index is lesser than 50% (or performance status greater than 2) and prognosis lesser at three months.","1544":"In February 2007, the radiation therapy department of the Jean Monnet Hospital in Epinal (France) has stopped the radiotherapy treatments after the discovery of a radiotherapy accident and bad practices leading to overexposure of patients between 1987 and 2006. The Regional Cancer Center \"Centre Alexis Vautrin\" in Nancy (France) was given the task of the new start of treatment activity. From February 2007 to January 2008, actions of training, updates of equipments and practices have been performed in the Epinal Hospital, guided by the quality approach, allowing the treatment of new patients in February 2008, with the radiation oncologists and the medical physicists of the Centre Alexis Vautrin, with the highest conditions of security and confidence.","1545":"The authors describe the recent organization of the pediatric radiation oncology in France. Since 2008, some criteria have been published by the National Cancer Institute and are mandatory to obtain a pediatric radiation therapy agreement. These criteria include clinical activity, on site involvement of the physician in the pediatric staff. Twice a month, a Web conferencing allows a clinical data discussion among the French pediatric RT community. A regular update of criteria is asked in order to adapt them to the new challenge.","1546":"Askin tumor is a rare malignant tumor arising from soft tissues of the chest wall, rarely in the lung. It occurs predominantly in young adults. It still raises many questions about its individualisation and its links with Ewing's sarcoma. We report a case of Askin tumor in a 5-year-old child with reviewing the different data from the literature.","1547":"Medical ethics is concerned with practices of care, their purposes, their feasibility. It raises questions about taking care of elderly patients with cancer. The decision criteria of exploration in search of cancer or treatment of confirmed cancer are numerous. Some are medical criteria (benefit on survival, polypathology, impact on the body, the prognosis associated with comorbidities), others are more subjective (quality of life, difficulty of patient's information, longer hospitalisation, ageism). Age appears to be the first lock, the second is cognitive disorders. Overexpenditure of current assumptions seems necessary to improve the care of elderly patients with cancer. Especially since many publications indicate that cancer treatments are generally well supported and beneficial to advanced ages.","1548":"Lymph-nodal involvement is a major prognostic factor of cervical cancer. Lymph-node status is classically evaluated by lymph-node dissection. This surgical approach has mainly a prognostic interest. The morbidity related to the lymph-node dissection is not nil, so numerous imaging or surgical techniques have been recently developed in order to reduce this morbidity. Currently, even with the progress of the imaging techniques, surgical lymph-node dissection is the standard approach. For the management of early cervical cancer, surgery is usually the sole treatment. In association with a laparoscopic lymph-node dissection, the sentinel node technique is a new approach that gives interesting data: possibility of performing frozen sections on the sentinel nodes in order to improve the management, discovery in an important proportion of cases of abnormal lymphatic pathways that are a potential aetiology of recurrence, and identification of lymph-node micrometastases that seem to be an important independent prognostic factor. In the future, evaluation of only the sentinel nodes may replace the pelvic lymph-node dissection. For advanced cervical cancers, the treatment is based on chemoradiotherapy. The paraaortic lymph-node status is an important prognostic factor that helps for defining the radiotherapy fields. New imaging techniques as PET Scan, may help for the evaluation of paraaortic lymph-node status. If the PET Scan is positive at the paraaortic level, there is no need for paraaortic lymph-node dissection and radiotherapy should be performed with pelvic and abdominal fields. But the false negative rate of the PET Scan is high and laparoscopic paraaortic lymph-node dissection is required in case of negative PET Scan at the paraaortic level.","1549":"Multiple new developments in the treatments of patients with Hodkgin lymphoma have occurred in the last 10 years. Radiation treatments have become extremely precise in localized Hodgkin lymphomas, on the other hand, they have almost completely disappeared in advanced stages. For patients with refractory or recurrent disease, it is strongly advocated, whenever feasible, to deliver a mantle field radiation treatment after an autologous stem cell transplant to avoid any further recurrence of the disease.","1550":"To quantify the prostate and seminal vesicles (SV) anatomic variations in order to choose appropriate margins including intrapelvic anatomic variations. To quantify volumetric benefit of image-guided radiotherapy (IGRT). Twenty patients, receiving a total dose of 70 Gy in the prostate, had a planning CT scan and eight weekly CT scans during treatment. Prostate and SV were manually contoured. Each weekly CT scan was registered to the planning CT scan according to three modalities: radiopaque skin marks, pelvis bone or prostate. For each patient, prostate and SV displacements were quantified. 3D maps of prostate and SV presence probability were established. Volumes including minimal presence probabilities were compared between the three modalities of registration. For the prostate intrapelvic displacements, systematic and random variations and maximal displacements for the entire population were: 5mm, 2.7 mm and 16.5mm in anteroposterior axis; 2.7 mm, 2.4mm and 11.4mm in superoinferior axis and 0.5mm, 0.8mm and 3.3mm laterally. Margins according to van Herk recipe (to cover the prostate for 90% of the patients with the 95% isodose) were: 8mm, 8.3mm and 1.9 mm, respectively. The 100% prostate presence probability volumes correspond to 37%, 50% and 61% according to the registration modality. For the SV, these volumes correspond to 8%, 14% and 18% of the SV volume. Without IGRT, 5mm prostate posterior margins are insufficient and should be at least 8mm, to account for intrapelvic anatomic variations. Prostate registration almost doubles the 100% presence probability volume compared to skin registration. Deformation of SV will require either to increase dramatically margins (simple) or new planning (not realistic).

A volumetric and dosimetric study was performed in 2006 using ARTIVIEW software (AQUILAB) for nine patients and 76 Cone Beam CT kV (CBCT kV). We have contoured targets and organs at risk from CBCT kV slides acquisitions. Second, we achieved a dose-volume histogram (DVH) study for a patient treated in 2007 with IMRT technique in comparison with the 2006 study. 2006 analysis: The study showed a very important variability of organ measurements. Seminal vesicles were strongly influenced by adjacent organs; observed differences for prostate could be explained by contouring uncertainty on the apex. Inter-sessions motions could be observed for bladder, rectum and seminal vesicles (SV). Part of prostate volume not encompassed by PTV is about 2.5%; VS volume outside PTV is about 35%. Tumoral conformation index (TCI) is inferior to 97.5% in 22% of all cases. Anteroposterior displacements of the prostate barycentre is superior to 5mm. From this analysis, we recommended the strict respect of hygienodietetic rules, and we have adapted the system settings for better immobilization, which were applied for the 2007 study. For the 2007 analysis, since April 2007, most of patients are treated with IMRT for prostate cancer, at the second part of the radiation therapy to encompass only the prostate volume. Dose-volume histograms showed a great spreading out for 2006 patients, and not for the 2007 patient. IMRT and IGRT should permit a margin reduction for PTV. Strict respect of hygienodietetics rules is necessary to avoid rectal distension and local recurrence.

Fifty planning and checking CT scans were performed in 25 patients. The check CT scan was performed before or after one of the three sessions of treatment. Coregistration to the planning CT scan was used to assess alignment of the isocentre to the reference markers. The relative position of the PTV with regard to isocentre allowed us to determine its total displacement (3D vector). Mean isocentre translations (+\/-SD) taking into account direction were -0.01+\/-0.7, -0.2+\/-1.3 and 0.07+\/-0.5mm in mediolateral, craniocaudal and anteroposterior directions respectively. Mean rotations (+\/- SD) were -0.02+\/-0.6, -0.08+\/-0.3 and -0.1+\/-0.3 degree in mediolateral, craniocaudal and anteroposterior axes respectively. Mean overall PTV displacement was 1.8+\/-1.5mm. PTV displacement was smaller than 2 and 3mm in 19\/25 and 23\/25 patients respectively. The accuracy of patient positioning using a stereotactic cranial mask system is similar to those reported in the literature and shows a satisfactory reproducibility with a standard dental fixation.

For each linac and its imaging device, a treatment plan was described. Moreover, studies concerning calculated shifts after imaging sessions were achieved. Using ExacTrac, for eight patients, a study compared daily shifts based on bony anatomy or on implanted markers. Considering mean values of displacements over a course of radiotherapy, dosimetric impact was evaluated. With the OBI-CBCT, two imaging modalities were used, kV-kV (0 degrees and 270 degrees ) and CBCT. Up to now, whatever the images, displacements were calculated using the bony anatomy. For both modalities and for 26 patients, shifts were compared. Since the beginning of the Tomotherapy HiArt use, MVCT was performed for each session of each patient. For 12 patients, mean displacements were calculated after five fractions. Then the deviations to those values were calculated. This was done to show the relevance of daily MVCT. This work allows us to report the use of three repositioning imaging devices in the radiotherapy department. At least they provide an efficient positioning tool. And they let us see the future radiotherapy which would probably be the dose-guided radiotherapy.

Images were obtained using a Varian equipment (OBI version 1.3, 645 to 650 projections in 370 degrees to acquire image), and patients were irradiated at source-tumor distance: 100cm. In vivo measurements were performed using radio-thermoluminescent dosimeters Harshaw-TLD700H (TLD) at skin (anterior-posterior and lateral axis crossing the rotation axis), with a fourth TLD group under the table thanks to a retrolaser. TLD's were calibrated at the kV-CBCT effective energy (64 keV), and the method validated using an anthropomorphic phantom, in which Gafchromic EBT films were also inserted. The phantom study showed that the dose distribution depends on the phantom position relative to the axis and that the doses measured at the phantom surface using TLD and films (good agreement) were maximum at the entrance of the anterior-posterior axis. Their arithmetic mean was equal, or a slightly greater than doses measured at mid-thickness of the phantom and at the level of the rectum (OAR). In vivo measurements performed on the five first patients (125 kV-CBCT) yield a mean skin dose per kV-CBCT varying from 5.8+\/-0.1 to 7.3+\/-0.2 cGy on the anterior-posterior axis. Lateral skin doses vary from 3.4+\/-0.2 to 4.5+\/-0.2 cGy. Doses delivered by repeated kV-CBCT are not negligible.

The acquisition of MVCBCT images was modelled in a treatment planning system by 67 photon beams (6 MV). A study was conducted to: compare the calculated and measured dose at the centre of a cylindrical phantom; compare the calculated and measured dose distributions in the Alderson-Rando phantom (pelvis); study the influence of MVCBCT image acquisition for the repositioning of a prostate cancer patient treated by 3D conformal radiotherapy (prescribed dose of 74 Gy), on the dose-volume histograms (DVH) for the treatment plus seven MVCBCT (protocol D1-3 and weekly), treatment plus 37 MVCBCT (one for each day of treatment). The difference between calculated and measured doses at the centre of the cylindrical phantom was less than 3%. A deviation of 7% maximum was found between the dose distribution calculated in the Rando phantom and the measured doses normalized at the beam isocentre. The dose delivered at the isocentre was equal to 3,7 cGy for a \"5 MU\" protocol, with a maximum dose of 6 cGy. In the case of the patient considered, the acquisition of 37 MVCBCT corresponded to an additional mean dose to the PTV of 1.2 Gy for a protocol \"5MU\" with a significant influence on the DVH. In view of this study, it appears that the doses delivered in frequent use of MVCBCT must be taken into account by the radiation oncologist in assessing the therapeutic dose delivered to the target volume and organs at risk.

We report two observations of GCT, the spine in a 51-year-old woman and a 14-year-old boy. They were revealed by spinal pain and cord compression for the second observation. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging showed osteolysis of the body and vertebral arch of L5 for the first and a process affecting the vertebral body and medullary canal of T6-T7 with spinal cord compression for the second case. The diagnosis was confirmed by histological examination in two cases. An external radiation at a dose of 45 Gy on L4, L5 and the sacrum was made in the first case and the dose of 40 Gy on the vertebrae of T4 to T9 and an additional 6 Gy on T5-T8 in the second case.

Radiation could be proposed as a standard treatment for patients with incomplete excision or where surgery would induces functional deficits.","1562":"Total body irradiation (TBI) has an established role as preparative regimen for bone-marrow transplantation in the treatment of hematological malignancies. Many randomized trials demonstrated that the clinical outcomes obtained from the association of TBI and cyclophosphamide are equivalent, or, sometimes, better than those based on chemotherapeutic agents. Despite the therapeutic progress of the last years, and the consequent improvement in the overall survival, this preparative regimen remains always associated with a relatively high rate of acute and late toxicity. In this article, we review the actual indications of TBI in clinical practice, and analyze the technological progress in this domain. We focus on the hypothesis that a selective irradiation of the hematopoietic or lymphoid organs is actually possible with intensity-modulated radiotherapy. Technical limits and preliminary results in terms of acute and late toxicities of intensity-modulated TBI are analyzed. With these new technologies, treatment-related toxicity is not anymore a major limiting factor in the preparative regimens for bone-marrow transplantation, allowing for a larger spectrum of TBI indications, a possible extension to patients older than 50 years, or a dose escalation. Preliminary results warrant, however, further evaluation in clinical trials to better assess the impact of this new approach on disease control and the long-term toxicity.","1563":"This work presents the introduction of a quality assurance program for the On-Board Imager (OBI, Varian) kVCBCT system, together with the results of 1 year monthly testing. Firstly the geometric precision and stability of the equipment and of the associated software were evaluated using the Marker phantom. The coincidence of the accelerator isocenter and the imager isocenter was verified as well as the accuracy of the registration of kVCBCT with reference CT images. Then, the kVCBCT image quality was evaluated using the Catphan 504 phantom and ArtiScan software (Aquilab) for both full-fan (FF) and half-fan (HF) imaging modes. The kVCBCT isocenter and image registration with correction of the table position were found to be within a tolerance of 2.0mm. Concerning the kVCBCT image quality, image noise and uniformity, the Hounsfield units (HU) stability and linearity, geometric distorsion and high contrast resolution were all found to be within the manufacturer's recommendations for both FF and HF modes. However, the low contrast resolution for the HF mode did not meet the manufacturer's specifications. The quality assurance tests introduced have defined the initial system characteristics and their evolution during a period of 1 year, demonstrating the stability of the OBI. ","1564":"","1565":"Cancer prevention has to be based on robust biological and epidemiological data, therefore its reappraisal becomes mandatory in view of recent progress in the understanding of carcinogenesis. The first phase of the carcinogenic process, that of initiation, is generally associated with mutation; however the role of extrinsic mutagens is less critical than was thought two decades ago. During intracellular oxygen metabolism, reactive oxygen species (ROS) are made which are potent mutagens. Defense mechanisms against these intrinsic mutagens include scavenger and enzymatic systems which destroy them (catalase, superoxide dismutase). When the radiation dose is low, DNA repair is very effective as well as the elimination of cells with unrepaired or misrepaired DNA. Therefore a small increase in the number of ROS, such as that caused by a small dose of radiation has most probably no significant effect on the risk of DNA damage. These conclusions are consistent with the concept of a practical threshold. The second phase, that of promotion, appears to be the key one. During the promotion phase, initiated cells must acquire new properties (immortalization, release of angiogenic factors, resistance to hypoxia, etc.) in order to become precancerous. This evolution is due to the accumulation in the genome of 6 to 10 new alteration defects. In the clone of initiated cells, the occurrence in one cell of a mutation or an epigenetic event gives birth to a subclone. There is a Darwinian type competition between the subclones and those with the more rapid growth because dominant (the acceleration of the growth rate can be due to shorter cell cycles or to an alleviation of cell proliferation exerted by the neighboring cells or the microenvironment). In the dominant subclones new genomic events provoke the appearance of new subclones growing more rapidly and having greater autonomy. The process is very slow because the specific genetic events that favour this evolution seldom occur. Promoting factors are agents that either perturb intercellular signalling or stimulate cell proliferation (e.g. hormones) or increase cell mortality: mechanical or chemical irritation (e.g. alcohol, bacteria, viruses) thereby inducing compensatory cell proliferation. Thus, gradually precancerous cells become able to divide more rapidly with greater autonomy. This phase ends when a subclone of cells has acquired the capacity of autonomous proliferation. The third phase is that of progression during which cells proliferate regularly without any stimulation. In one of the cells of one of the precancerous lesions (e.g. polyps) a cell acquires the capacity of invading surrounding tissue or to metastasize. The whole carcinogenic process is very slow, extending over several decades, because the specific mutations seldom occur and the probability of an accumulation of several specific mutations in the same cell or cell lineage is very small. It can be accelerated by intense stimulation of cell proliferation or genetic instability. Ionizing radiations act firstly as a mutagen, however when the dose is high they also kill a significant proportion of cells and by a homeostatic mechanism they induce cell proliferation and clonal amplification. It has been claimed that even the smallest dose of radiation can induce a cancer. This concept is associated with the LNT model and it is not based on scientific evidence. It has fuelled a fear of radiation which had detrimental consequences. Conversely the high efficacy of defense mechanisms against radiocarcinogenesis, particularly when the tissue is not disorganized, can explain the lack of carcinogenic effect of contamination by small doses of radium or thorium which has been observed on radium dial painters or in patients injected with thorotrast. The study of second cancers in patients treated by radiotherapy could provide important information and should be actively pursued with two aims: reduce the incidence of second cancers; to better understand radiocarcinogenesis and the relation between dose and carcinogenic effect.","1566":"Chemoradiotherapy is the standard treatment of inoperable and\/or non-resectable IIIA\/B non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Aware of the necessity to increase local control in locally advanced NSCLC, we analyzed the feasibility of high-dose three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in the treatment of localised NSCLC. We undertook a retrospective analysis of consecutive patients with non-resectable NSCLC treated with high-dose (74Gy) standard-fractionation 3D-CRT, with particular attention to the relationship between lung and heart radiation-induced toxicities. Fifty patients (41 males, 9 females) were included. A total of 35 (70%) patients received the planned total dose of 74Gy. Patients irradiated to inferior doses interrupted the treatment because of limiting toxicities. Induction and concurrent chemotherapy was delivered to 39 (78%) and 14 (28%) patients, respectively. Eight (16%) patients experienced grade 3-4 acute lung toxicity, all of them having a history of pulmonary disease, a FEV1 below 1.6 L, and a lung V(20) of at least 25%. Three (6%) patients were deemed to experience radiation-induced cardiac toxicity. This study assesses the feasibility of delivering a total dose of 74 Gy combined with chemotherapy in locally advanced NSCLC. High lung and heart V(20) increases the risk of radiation-induced lung and cardiac toxicity, the later being highly difficult to precisely assess, as late deaths are rarely documented, and responsibility of the treatment might be often underestimated. The precise evaluation of cardiac condition may be helpful to spare fragile patients from potentially toxic effects of high-dose radiation, especially in controlled trials.

Five-year overall survival rate was 91% (95% CI, 80-100%). Five patients (20%) developed distant metastases (one after chemotherapy) and three (12%) locoregional relapse (one after tumorectomy and unknown margin without radiotherapy, two after mastectomy and involved margins with radiotherapy). Wide breast surgery (that can be conservative in selected patients) is the mainstay of the treatment of non metastatic malignant phyllodes tumors of the breast. To better determine the respective roles of adjuvant systemic treatment and radiotherapy, further clinical studies and the search for new prognostic and predictive factors remain necessary.

The direct medical cost of using PET was assessed by micro-costing. The costs of new exams and the costs and savings associated with changes in the chosen treatment were calculated on the basis of reimbursement rates. The economic study was conducted over 2 years and included 209 patients (97 patients with Hodgkin's disease and 112 with NSCLC). The mean cost of using PET, corresponding to an extra cost, was approximately 800 euro (50% for the radionuclide FDG).

Of the 20 hospitals involved in the clinical study, eight reference centers participated to the medico-economic study evaluating the costs of staff and equipment, as well as the costs of maintenance and consumables. Three hundred and sixty-five patients were enrolled over two years in the economic study, corresponding to 197 radiotherapy treatments without RG and 168 with RG. Patients treated during the learning phase (n=27) were excluded from the comparison with the control group. The use of RG in routine practice induced a cost increase of respectively euro1256 and euro996 per treatment for lung and breast cancer patients treated with breath-hold techniques, versus euro1807 and euro1510 for lung and breast cancer patients treated with synchronized gating techniques. Overcosts were mainly due to extra working time of medical staff and medical technicians and to extra use of equipment during treatment sessions.

Radiotherapy alone was resumed after a few days and the total dose could be delivered, with good tolerance. At 2-month follow-up, the intramuscular lesion had regressed. Several other cases of patients with poor tolerance to the association of AA and radiotherapy have been reported. Further studies of the effectiveness and tolerance of the combination treatment are needed before indications for AA can be extended to other diseases.","1582":null,"1583":"Conventional radiotherapy (RT) in breast cancer treatment includes a total dose of 50Gy with a 16Gy-boost in a smaller volume. After mastectomy, radiotherapy of all node-positive patients seems to be applied whatever the positive node number. Modulation of RT technique uses the fraction dose, namely through accelerated hypofractionation regimen in a constant volume. A group of patient with a low risk of recurrence may benefit from this technique. In a smaller irradiated volume, accelerated hypofractionation still belongs to intensive clinical research evaluating intraoperative RT, brachytherapy, Mammosite, and external partial breast irradiation. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy decreases the risk of moist desquamation. The development of the gating offers greater protection of certain critical organs including lung, heart, and chest\/ribs. Finally, predictive tests identifying patients at high risk of developing late effects led us to adapt RT technique to some of them and therefore increase long term therapeutic ratio.","1584":"In hadron therapy centers that have only fixed horizontal beams (i.e. most carbon ions centers and protons centers of first generation), the angulations of the beam remain technically limited, especially for the treatment of children under general anaesthesia with posterior-oblique (40 degrees or so) beams in supine position. We have been developing recently an original positioning system allowing for treatment with posterior-oblique beams, either from right or left directions, by keeping the child in the adequate position.","1585":"Further to the Epinal events, Health Ministers P. Bas then R. Bachelot-Narquin have launched a plan of work devoted to radiotherapy; they have also committed the SFRO President, within the framework of a mission, to make proposals taking into account the demography of professionals and their level of competence, valorization of careers, cooperation with medical oncologists, delegations of authorities, mutualisation of human and material resources. Due to the numerous actions of the roadmap managed by the tutelages, the aim of the mission was focused on the modalities of work of the professionals linked to radiotherapy: radiation oncologists, radiographers and physicists.","1586":"","1587":"The quality insurance in radiotherapy in the frame of highly complex technical process as Intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) needs independent control of the delivered dose to the patient. Actually, up to now, most of the radiotherapy treatments rely only on computed dosimetry through a rather complicated series of linked simulation tool. This dosimetry approach requires also qualified treatment means based on cautious quality insurance procedures. However, erroneous parameters could be difficult to detect and systematical errors could happen leading to radiotherapy accidents. In this context, in vivo dosimetry has a critical role of final control of the delivered dose. As many beam incidences and ports are used for any photontherapy treatment, external control could be very tedious and time consuming. Therefore, innovations are needed for in vivo dosimetry to provide ergonomic and efficient tools for these controls. This paper presents a review of technologies and products that can be used for in vivo dosimetry. It proposes also a reflection on the concepts to develop future devices suitable for this purpose. The technical means with their physical principles are reviewed, the clinical experiences demonstrating the feasibility of new techniques are then summarized and finally, the early clinical use and its impact on clinical practice is review.","1588":"In case of external breast radiotherapy, the usual treatment consists of two tangential beams homogeneously attenuated by a dynamic or physics wedge in order to obtain the most homogeneous dose distribution as possible. Depending of the shape and size of the breast volume, we may observe with this technique dose heterogeneity over 20% from the recommendation of the International Committee on Radiation Units and Measurements (95-107%). We propose to study breast treatment planning by compensating tissues thickness in order to decrease dose heterogeneity observed on the dose distribution for conventional treatment. We have segmented the initial tangential beams used for this kind of treatment into several smaller beams. Their shape was adapted to the distribution of the greys level on the DRR image. Therefore, we have compensated the thickness gradient and we have given the right dose to the right thickness group. Dose distribution performed with this method shows an improvement of the dose homogeneity in the three space dimensions and a decrease of the maximal dose between 5 and 10% over the ICRU recommendation. This technique allows us to perform breast irradiation on a single photon energy linac even if the treated volume presents important thickness gradient. However, in case of large breast, this method is not able to reduce the overdosage at the entry of the volume due to inappropriate photon energy relative to the breast thickness. ","1589":null,"1590":"To evaluate our results in the treatment of male breast cancer patients with respect to local control (LC), overall survival (OS) and possible prognosis factors for survival. Thirty-nine patients with male breast cancer have been retrospectively studied with the trial aim to evaluate the results of our practice. Among them, 94.8% had invasive ductal carcinoma (IDC), 2.6% invasive papillary carcinoma (IPC) and 2.6% invasive lobular carcinoma (ILC) and the distribution according to stage was found to be 12.8, 46.2, 30.7 and 10.3% in Stages I, II, III and IV, respectively. Among the patients, 7.7% received radiotherapy (RT) and hormonotherapy (HT), 22.8% received chemotherapy (CT), 61.8% received chemoradiotherapy (CRT) and HT and 7.7% received HT in addition to surgery. The distant metastases rate was 36% and the local recurrence rate was 5%. All the local recurrences and the distant metastases had occurred after the first two years. The five-year disease free survival (DFS) and OS rates were 65.8 and 80.1% respectively. In our series, univariate analysis for OS demonstrated statistical significance for lymph node metastases (p=0.00001), stage (p=0.0098) and age (p=0.03); while RT in the treatment modality (p=0.6849), and tumor size (p=0.4439) demonstrated no significance. The presence of lymph node metastases significantly impairs OS (p=0.004) and DFS (p=0.014) in multivariate analysis. Postoperative radiotherapy was important in the management of male breast cancer to improve LC resulting in one local failure, but did not improve OS and DFS in our analysis. The presence of lymph node metastases significantly impaired OS and DFS. ","1591":"Breathing-adapted techniques in external radiotherapy lead to the improvement of the taken into account of the tumour motion during the patient treatment. Indeed, this motion involves dosimetric uncertainties, in particular during a dynamic treatment (intensity-modulated radiation therapy, dynamic wedge...). As tumoral movement is complex and is carried out in various directions of space, a dynamic platform moving in one or two plans was conceived. This article approaches the technical aspects of design and functioning of this prototype. A study of the dosimetric effects of the respiratory movement on one and two plans during a dynamic treatment without gating will be presented. Films were irradiated while varying the rates with wedged fields at various speeds. The penumbra of beams were compared with the static case and appeared twice broader in the majority of the cases. The results highlighted the contributions of the longitudinal and the axial components of the motion on the form of the dose distribution. These results were completed with gamma index measurements to determine an internal margin. Moreover, this platform proves to be a promising tool for breathing-adapted treatment, in particularly to test the synchronisation of RPM system in fluoroscopic mode in board imaging system.","1592":"Radiation therapy is now widely accepted as an efficacious treatment of localized prostate cancer. Recent advances, namely with the development of conformal radiotherapy, allowed to increase the total dose in the target volumes with greater local control. A forward step achieved with intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) in terms of therapeutic ratio between target volumes and critical organs. IMRT offers an inverse planning dosimetry and a modulation of the fields during irradiation. This article presents recent technical and clinical advances in IMRT focused on prostate cancer.","1593":"Dermatological effects are among the most frequent side-effects in patients receiving erlotinib (Tarceva). However, there no official recommendations on the preventive or curative management of those erlotinib-related skin effects (ERSE). The \"Prise En Charge des Effets Dermatologiques sous Erlotinib\" (PRECEDE) study was designed to study how ERSE are being managed in France. The PRECEDE study is an observational retrospective study which included every nonsmall cell lung cancer patients treated with erlotinib in seven cancer centers in France from January 2005 to December 2007. Data related to preventive or curative treatment of ERSE were collected from the medical files of the patients. Two hundred and thirty-four patients were included; 48.7% of them had been delivered information on the potential occurrence of ERSE and 15.8% of those 234 patients had had prescription of drugs to be taken in case of ERSE, while 65.0% presented with ERSE which resolved in the majority of cases (86.2% of the patients), either spontaneously or under treatment. In the 85 patients in whom treatment was successful, 178 drug prescriptions comprising 35 different drugs were recorded. ERSE are frequent but regress in most cases, spontaneously or under treatment. However, there is still a wide variety of drugs used. This demonstrates that there is a need for recommendations on the management of ERSE in order to prevent and treat this erlotinib-related effect. ","1594":"CyberKnife((R)) (CK) allows stereotaxic irradiation for thoracic tumor thanks to a tracking system which potential is known for lung tumors. This technique has never been used to treat breast tumors but may have a real potential. In order to define the interest of treating breast tumors with CK, we have conducted a phase I study with a dose escalation, adding CK to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in view of allowing conservative treatment for patients that will not have surgery in first intent. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy includes six cures, including three of docetaxel and three of FEC. CK treatment is made during the second cure of chemotherapy. Two dose levels are delivered in three fractions: 19.5 and 22.5Gy. Surgery is performed six to eight weeks after the last cure. The primary objective is to define tolerance of stereotactic irradiation concomitant with neoadjuvant chemotherapy for breast tumors. Skin toxicity is the limiting criterion of the study. The secondary objectives are both histological response and quality of surgery. Here, we are presenting the preliminary results of the 2-dose level. This study participates in the French national grant called Programme hospitalier de recherche clinique (PHRC). No skin toxicity of grade I or more have been find. Surgery was performed as conventional and there was no complication. Pathology exams found one complete response, one lymphangitis and one partial response. These preliminary results seem to be promising but need to be confirmed. We carry on the dose escalation study. ","1595":"The use of chemoradiation for patients with localized pancreatic cancer is controversial. Although some randomized trials have indicated that chemoradiation improves the median survival of patients with locally advanced as well as resected pancreatic cancer, other more recent trials have called into question the role of chemoradiation and have supported the use of chemotherapy. In the adjuvant setting, the high local tumor recurrence\/persistence rate in all trials probably reflects the inclusion of patients with incompletely resected tumors, whose prognosis is similar to the prognosis of patients with locally advanced who do not undergo resection, making these trials difficult to interpret. More precise clinical staging and selection of patients appropriate for surgical resection is an important goal. The keys to the successful integration of radiotherapy in the care of patients with localized pancreatic cancer are selection, sequencing and smaller treatment volumes. A strategy of initial chemotherapy followed by consolidation with a well-tolerated chemoradiation regimen both in the adjuvant and locally advanced settings maximizes benefits of both treatment options, which are in fact complementary. Herein, we discuss the rationale for this approach as well as the ongoing investigation of novel radiation approaches designed to enhance outcome through the molecular and physical targeting of disease as well as the investigation of neoadjuvant chemoradiation in radiographically resectable and borderline resectable pancreatic cancer.","1596":"To assess the skin toxicity of this scheme and the time to its appearance. Eighty-one prospectively recorded patients (pts), treated in Radiotherapy Department for Breast Cancer (BC) with radiotherapy (RT) to the whole breast at the dose of 42.9Gy per 13 fractions (F) per 5 weeks have been studied. Skin reactions were monitored weekly using the National Cancer Institute-Common Toxicity Criteria scoring system, version 3. All risk factors as tobacco smoking, diabetes, obesity were also recorded. All 81 pts, aged from 40 to 83 years (median: 70 years) received whole breast RT 42.9Gy per 13 F without lymph node irradiation after breast conserving surgery. There were no pts with concurrent chemo- and\/or hormonal therapy. Seventeen patients (21%) have been treated using decubitus dorsal (DD) technique and 64 (79%) using the previously described isocentric decubitus lateral (IDL) technique. During the RT, only 34 pts (42%) experienced grade I skin reactions and 47 pts (58%) were without. At the last day of the breast irradiation, there were 66 (81%) grade I (N=59) and II (N=7) skin reactions and 15 pts (19%) without. The early skin tolerance of this scheme was considered to be excellent. But in the 2 weeks after the RT, 20 pts (25%) asked for new clinics with their radiation oncologist as a matter of urgency due to worsening of their skin condition. All of them have been seen by their physician and\/or the nurse. Of them, nine presented grade I and 11 presented grade II skin reactions, with necessity of special skin care. The analysis of these results was realized and delayed clinics were organized for all pts treated with this scheme 10-14 days after the end of the radiation treatment. The breast RT 42.9Gy\/13 F have been previously described as an efficacious and well tolerated scheme. This prospective homogeneous group of patients showed that delayed early skin reactions could appear in some cases. Therefore complementary clinics are needed to detect and treat these reactions. ","1597":"Prostate cancer is associated with a risk of lymph node involvement, which increases with clinical stage, Gleason score, and PSA level at diagnosis. When this risk is higher than 15%, it has been suggested to irradiate the pelvis in addition to the prostate despite an increased risk of gastrointestinal toxicities. However, several randomized trials seem to call into question this therapeutic approach. This review presents the potent role of pelvic irradiation in the treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer treated with exclusive radiotherapy.","1598":"Maxillary sinus carcinomas are rare malignancies of the face, characterized by high local relapsing rate. Modalities of treatment are without consensus and respective roles of radiation therapy and surgery remain controversial. As those malignancies are often diagnosed at locally advanced stage, radiation therapy may frequently be used for patients having unresectable advanced disease. Nevertheless, surgery remains treatment of choice for more localized malignancies, in association with systematic postoperative radiotherapy. For those patients whose prognosis remains pejorative, it is necessary to precise the role of radiotherapy in first intention for inoperable tumors, to define necessity for nodal treatment performing and evaluate the place of neoadjuvant or concomitant chemotherapy in a multimodal strategy.","1599":"Dysfunction of the ataxia telangiectasia mutated (ATM) gene has been related to defective cell cycle control and genomic instability due to the impaired repair of DNA double strand breaks. Although increased radiosensitivity in ATM heterozygous patients has been suggested in preclinical data, clinical implication of ATM variant remains debated. Despite frequent in vitro hypersensitivity in patients with severe radiation-induced delayed toxicity, heterozygoty for ATM gene does not represent the major cause of unexpected complications after radiation therapy. This might be partially due to potential coexistence of alterations in additional genes that would play a role in development of late radiation-induced adverse response. Although several data suggest that some ATM polymorphisms would increase grade 3 subcutaneous fibrosis at lower doses compared with patients who did not possess these genetic alterations, the relationship between the presence of ATM mutations or sequence variants and radiation-induced toxicity remains controversial in part because of their biological and functional significance. Considering the lack of prospective data, patients with ATM mutation should be considered as candidates for both dose volume and dose reduction clinical trials.","1600":"The preclinical rationale for chemoradiation was demonstrated. While chemoradiation allowed for improved outcome in nonsmall cell lung cancer patients, prognosis of patients remains particularly pejorative, encouraging major expansion of targeted therapies concurrently with radiotherapy. Thorough knowledge in biological mechanisms of oncogenesis permitted identifying new therapeutic targets, for which specific interactions allow pharmacological radiosensitivity modulation. Two modalities of EGFR inhibitors have been developed: monoclonal antibodies and tyrosin kinase inhibitors, which assessement remains at its beginning. Angiogenesis inhibition was also developed, illustrating the absolute necessity for careful clinical assessment. Drugs with multiple targets are becoming available and offer new optimization modalities for radiation therapy.","1601":"To study prognostic factors of obliteration and risk factors of brain radiation necrosis in order to propose an algorithm for radiosurgery prescription for cerebral arteriovenous malformations (cAVM). One hundred and seventy-nine patients were analysed. Radiosurgery delivered 6 or 10 MV X-rays by arc therapy in 84% of cases, or by fixed field in 16% of cases using two different micro-multileaf collimators (micro-MLC). Follow-up consisted of screening radiation necrosis by MRI every 6 months, and assessing local control by arteriography every 2 years. Obliteration was defined as at least 95% reduction of cAVM volume. Cox proportional hazard model was used to evaluate the local control and the appearance of radiation necrosis over time. Local control rate was 82.7% with the mean follow-up of 3.1 years (0.5-11). Significant prognostic factors were: simple nidus (RR=2.8, p&lt;0.0001), number of embolizations before radiosurgery below 4 (RR=2.9, p&lt;0.0001), prescribed dose to the periphery of at least 18 Gy (RR=2, p=0.0002), nidus volume below8cm(3) (RR=1.9, p=0.0002), and number of table positions below six (RR=1.4, p=0.05). Radiation necrosis rate was 11.2% with a mean time to onset of 18 months. Significant predictive factors were: fixed field versus arc therapy (according to MLC RR=9.1, p&lt;0.0001, and RR=15.1, p=0.01), age below 30 years (RR=2.5, p=0.04), depth of cAVM greater than or equal to 7 cm (RR=7.6, p=0.008), and volume of brain tissue covered by the 12 Gy isodose (V12 Gy) of at least 11 cm(3) (RR=7.8, p=0.05). A radiosurgery prescription algorithm taking into account the prescribed dose to the periphery (&gt; or = 18 Gy) and reduction of V12 Gy was elaborated from these data. ","1602":"Phyllode tumors of the breast are fibroepithelial tumors similar to fibroadenomas but with a predominant conjunctive tissue component. These are composed of a connective tissue stroma and epithelial elements. They are rare with an incidence of 0.3-0.9% of all breast neoplasms. The present study demonstrates the recent experiences in diagnosis, therapeutical management and clinical follow-up of this disease. This is a retrospective study of the experience of the Institut National d'Oncologie (INO, Rabat) from 1998 to 2006. We included 53 patients. Median age was 37.2 years (15-67), tumor size was 1-30cm (median 10.25cm). The histological diagnosis was based on the biopsy in (7.8%) cases and extemporany in 22% cases, distant metastasis occurred in two patients; the treatment consisted of a surgery. The median follow-up was three years. Local recurrence occurred in ten patients. Distant metastasis occurred in two patients and five patients have died. The confrontation of our results to the data of the international literature shows that the diagnosis of the phyllodes tumours is histological. The basis of the treatment is surgery. The adjuvant radiotherapy is very important in patients at high risk for local recurrence; chemotherapy has a badly defined place. The prognostic is based on the histological characters of the tissue conjunctive component of these tumours. ","1603":"Primary malignant non-hodgkin lymphoma involving the prostate is rare. Most of the time, it is associated with extraprostatic disease. We report a case of a 72-year-old patient presenting with acute lower urinary tract irritative symptoms, due to large B-cell lymphoma limited to the prostate. Combination of chemotherapy with extern beam radiotherapy provided long-term local control.","1604":"The mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma is a distinct clinical pathologic entity that develops in diverse anatomic locations such as the stomach, salivary gland, thyroid, lung, skin and breast. However, colorectal involvement is extremely rare. To our knowledge, only ten cases of primary rectal MALT lymphoma have been reported in the literature. We report a 46-year-old woman with rectal MALT lymphoma, which regressed after radiotherapy. The patient had rectal bleeding. Colonoscopy showed a pseudonodular and ulcerated big fold in the rectum. Microscopic and immunohistologic studies of the biopsy specimen showed typical features of low grade MALT lymphoma. Upper endoscopy showed chronic gastritis with lymphoid follicles but without any infiltration of lymphoma cells. Helicobacter pylori infection was confirmed by histology. No extra-intestinal involvement was found on the staging evaluation, which included computed tomography (CT) of the abdomen, chest, pelvis and a bone marrow biopsy. We attempted to eradicate H. pylori with a 7-day course of omeprazole, amoxycillin, and metronidazole. Eradication was proved successful by endoscopy. Repeated colonoscopy 4 months after the end of treatment showed that the rectal tumor had not regressed. Biopsy specimens confirmed the persistent infiltration of lymphoma cells. The patient was considered to be a non-responder to eradication therapy and was indicated for radiotherapy. He underwent a total of 34 Gy. Complete regression was confirmed by colonoscopic and histologic examination at 2 months after the end of treatment. He was followed up closely with colonoscopy, but no relapse of these lesions was detected after 12 months.","1605":"Adenoid cystic carcinoma (ACC) of the breast is a rare neoplasm. We report two observations occurring in female patients, 54 and 65 years old, who consulted for a mastodynia. Clinical examination showed limited painful breast nodules. On ultrasound and mammography they are well-limited bulky mass without microcalcifications. Diagnosis was based on final histopathological exam completed by immunohistochemistry or after slides review. The two patients were treated by mammectomy plus adjuvant radiotherapy and remain alive in remission with a follow-up of 29 and 36 months.","1606":"To assess waiting time effect in patient with multiform glioblastoma (GBM) treated with 3D conformal planned postoperative radiotherapy and to investigate the impact of chemotherapy as first adjuvant treatment. We retrospectively analyzed 94 consecutive patients with histologically proven GBM. Surgery was considered as macroscopically complete in 33 cases (35%). Median irradiation dose was 60 Gy (8-63, mean 56 Gy). Dose per fractions was 1.8 Gy (five patients), 2 Gy (76 patients) and 2.7 Gy (13 patients). Forty patients received adjuvant pre-radiotherapy chemotherapy as intra-operative carmustine (nine patients) and adjuvant five-day protocol temozolomide alone (31 patients) or with cisplatinum (two patients). All patients received only one chemotherapy cycle. There were 56 males and 38 females. Median age was 62.1 years old (7-82, mean: 59.2 year). Median follow-up was nine months (1-49). For overall patients, median waiting time between fist clinical sign and start of the non surgical treatment was 68 days ((3-274, mean: 81.9 days). For those who received chemotherapy as first treatment, this waiting time was 54 days (3-221, mean 68.3 days). For overall patients, median waiting time between surgery and beginning of radiotherapy was 46 days (8-401, mean 59.3 days). For patients who did not receive chemotherapy as first adjuvant treatment this waiting time was 46 days (-278, mean 55.4 days). Median local control was 14.5 months. Six, 12-, 18-, and 24-month local control rates were 75.6+\/-4.6%, 57.6+\/-6.2%, and 36.7+\/-8% and 27.6+\/-8.2%, respectively. According to multivariate analysis, we retrieved two independent prognostic factors of local control, macroscopically total removal of the tumor [RR=2.85, IC 95% (1.3-6.5), p=0.012] and irradiation dose above 60 Gy, [RR=3.14, IC 95% (1.5-6.6), p=0.002].

Between February 1993 and December 2004, nine patients with primary gastric high-grade lymphoma have been treated by the Lymphoma Committee of Sfax (Tunisia). The sex ratio was 1.5. The mean age was 44.9 years. Histological type was the large cell B lymphoma in 100% of the cases. Disease was stage I in eight cases and stage II in one case (Ann Arbor Classification). The treatment consisted in primary chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy of the stomach with or without regional nodes (40 Gy). After treatment, all patients had complete remission. With a mean follow-up of 55.7 months, one patient was lost to follow-up; the other patients were alive with complete remission. No major acute toxicities or late effects were found. Overall survival was 100% at five years. Chemotherapy associated with radiotherapy can be proposed to patients having localised and aggressive primary gastric lymphoma with favourable prognosis, since this treatment is well tolerated and provides satisfactory control of the disease. ","1608":"","1609":"To evaluate the dosimetric impact of breath-hold during radiotherapy of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) and to determinate the optimal respiratory phase for treatment (exhale or inhale). Two CT scans were performed in inhale and in exhale in 20 patients with HCC. The GTV was delineated slice by slice on the inspiration breath hold acquisition (GTV(insp)) and on the expiration breath hold acquisition (GTV(exp)). The superposition of two GTV allowed to obtain the global GTV (free respiration). PTV was defined by adding a margin of 1cm around each GTV. The liver, the duodenum, the two kidneys, the stomach and the spinal cord were delineated on each acquisition as organs at risk (OAR). Three dosimetric plans were created on inspiration, expiration and on global PTV. The mean reduction in the volume of PTV with conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) in the hold-breath group compared to the free respiration group was of 33.5+\/-11.9%. The average difference of V50%, V20, V30, V40 and V50 were around 4% in favor of the breath hold. The average value of NTCP was 8.9% in free respiration, 4.5% in expiration and 3.2% in inspiration. Further improvement in the OARs dosimetric parameters for the breath hold was observed. Compared to the conformal radiotherapy with free respiration, the breath-hold allows reducing the volume of the PTV and the doses to the healthy liver and organs at risk. The use of this modality during different radiotherapy techniques (3D-CRT, IMRT and stereotactic) may be recommended. No difference in dosimetric value has been observed between the breath hold in expiratory and inspiratory phases. ","1610":"The optimal schedule of irradiation in elderly patients suffering from glioblastoma multiforme (GBM) is unsettled. This study reviewed the charts of 28 consecutive GBM patients aged 70 years or more with a Karnofsky Performance Status (KPS) greater than or equal to 70 who received a short course of radiotherapy (40 grays in 15 fractions over three weeks). The median age at surgery was 74.6 years (range, 70.1-85.7). No patient received prior or concomitant chemotherapy. The median progression-free survival and overall survival were 21.6 weeks (95% CI, 17.0-39.9) and 50.6 weeks (95% CI, 26.3-62.0), respectively. Even within a narrow range (&lt;90 or &gt;or=90), KPS remained a prognostic factor (p=0.03). Tolerance appeared acceptable in terms of KPS changes and corticosteroid use during radiation therapy. These results support the efficacy of short schedule radiotherapy for GBM in elderly patients with a good KPS. ","1611":"Results of surgery in locally advanced esophageal carcinomas (T3 and\/or N1) are disappointing. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy (RTCT) gave equivalent survival results in many phase II studies. Two randomized trials (French and German) compared surgery or additional RTCT after a first phase of RTCT. Both drew the same conclusions, that is surgery did not improve overall survival but increased postoperative mortality. However, local control was found better in the surgical arms, and in some subgroups, esophagectomy improved disease-free survival suggesting that some patients may benefit from surgery. After preoperative RTCT, absence of residual disease in the surgical specimen (pathological complete response) occurs in 15 to 30%; these patients underwent a radical surgery without any benefit but with high risk of morbidity and mortality. Nevertheless, it is still difficult to select this sub-population: CT-scan or endoscopy with biopsies have a low sensitivity and specificity. 18-FDG-PET-scan, performed after or during the RTCT, is able to increase sensitivity, but only preliminary results with small populations are available. No biological factor of chemoradiosensitivity (p53, NfkappaB, p21...) could predict who will respond or not. Another approach is to reserve surgery only to patients with a demonstrated local failure (salvage surgery) but the feasibility of this technique is still debated. Finally, local relapses are frequent after RTCT and optimisation of the current schedules is mandatory to improve oncologic results. Unfortunately, increasing the radiation dose did not improve local control and showed more toxicities. New drugs as taxanes, oxaliplatine, or targeted therapies are tested in on-going phase III trial.","1612":"To evaluate dosimetry of helicoidal tomotherapy versus three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT) with and without IMRT for the treatment of soft tissue sarcoma (STS) of the thigh. A retrospective study was performed for three patients who received 3D-CRT as adjuvant radiation therapy for STS of the thigh. These three patients had a tumor in posterior, adductor or anterior compartment of the thigh. In each case, three treatments plans were optimised in tomotherapy, without bloc, with directional bloc and complete bloc of controlateral limb, to adequately treat the planning target volume and spare organ at risk. For each patient, we compare the three modalities of tomotherapy or \"classical\" IMRT from a clinac with the 3D-CRT actually performed for the treatment. Tomotherapy provides improved PTV coverage and dose homogeneity. This benefit was comparable in the three tomotherapy plans. The average D95% for tomotherapy and 3D-CRT were 97.6% and 94.8% respectively and the standard deviation is, at least, divided by two with conformal and is always better than performed with a clinac. The volume of the surrounding soft tissues receiving at least full prescription and hot spots, as evaluated by D2%, were significantly reduced in tomotherapy. Nevertheless, the results concerning the skin, the femur and the gonads were dependent on the tumor site in the thigh and not always improved with tomotherapy dosimetric studies. For this preliminary study, tomotherapy can provide better coverage and dose uniformity in PTV and minimize the volume of surrounding muscular tissues receiving high doses. However, in this study, there is no benefit for others OAR (skin, femur and gonads) except in particular constraint (for instance for a precise sparing of cutaneous or bony area). Other dosimetric studies, followed by prospective evaluations with long-term follow-up are needed to determine whether tomotherapy can improve outcome for patients with STS of the thigh.

Majority of treatments deliver either one fraction (6 to 10 Gy) or multifractions mainly using 30 Gy in ten fractions. In the past decade, several randomized trials aimed to determine the optimal scheme of radiotherapy in this setting. In the present review, the efficacy of radiotherapy on bone metastases will be evaluated using the following parameters: the partial or complete responses on pain, the reduction of antalgic intake, bone recalcification, and need for reirradiation. Other parameters must also be considered, such as the primary site, number of metastasis, performance status, overall prognosis and side effects of radiotherapy.","1614":null,"1615":"Recent studies give rise to the hypothesis, that adjuvant chemoradioimmunotherapy with 5-fluorouracil (5-FU), cisplatin and interferon-alpha (IFN-alpha) might be a possible new treatment of pancreatic cancer in resected patients. We report the up-to-now experience at our institution. Eleven patients with histological diagnosis of localized carcinoma of the pancreas (n=7) or periampullary (n=4) were prospectively analyzed. Four patients were deemed unresectable because of local invasion of adjacent organs (neoadjuvant setting) and seven patients underwent curative resection (adjuvant setting). Eight patients were classified as T3 carcinomas and three T4 carcinomas. Fifty-five per cent (6\/11) of the patients presented with positive lymph node involvement. One histological Grade I, six Grade II and three Grade III were detected. External conformal irradiation to a total dose of 50.4 Gy with 1.8 Gy per day was delivered. All patients received a concomitant chemotherapy with continuous 5-FU 200 mg\/m2 per day on 28 treatment days and intravenous bolus cisplatin 30 mg\/m2 per week (Day 2, 9, 16, 23, 30). A recombinant r-IFN-alpha was administered on three days weekly during Week one to five of the radiotherapy course as subcutanous injections with 3*3 Mio. I.U. weekly. The four-year overall survival rate for all patients was 55%. In the neoadjuvant group, three of four patients died due to progressive disease; in the adjuvant group, combined chemoradioimmunotherapy lead to controlled disease in five of seven patients. The overall toxicity was well-managed. Our data strengthens the hypothesis of concomitant chemoradioimmunotherapy with 5-FU, IFN-alpha and cisplatin as a possible new treatment of pancreatic cancer in resected patients. ","1616":"Even if the prognosis of patients with cervical cancer has been dramatically improved with concomitant chemoradiation, brachytherapy still plays fundamental role in the therapeutic approach of patients with Figo stage I-IV cervical carcinoma. The development of imaging with three-dimensional dosimetry has contributed to the improvement in target and organs at risk knowledge. In 2005 and 2006, GEC-ESTRO recommendations on 3-D based image brachytherapy have defined the different volumes of interest. These recommendations have been validated with intercomparison delineation studies. Data on dose to normal tissues are better known with dose volume-histograms analysis. Dose limits to the bladder are high in the range of 90 Gy to the 2 cm3 while 2 cm3 limits to the rectum do not differ from ICRU point. The sigmoid is currently under study as this organ was not extensively studied before the era of imaging. Doses to the tumour (HR-CTV or IR-CTV) are not clearly stated and will likely depend on tumour extension.","1617":"Postoperative radiotherapy after breast surgery increases overall survival by decreasing the local relapse rate. The main site of relapse is the breast or the chest wall. The value of irradiation of the nodal basins is still discussed. It must be emphasized that nodal areas were systematically irradiated in the postmastectomy randomized trials demonstrating a benefit in survival for adjuvant radiotherapy. Axillary relapses are infrequent in case of complete axillary dissection; complementary irradiation could be proposed if the axillary dissection is incomplete or if there is a massive pathologic involvement of the axilla. Its main complication is lymphoedema, which remains the most frequent sequellae of the treatment of breast cancer. Supraclavicular irradiation is logical in case of axillary involvement. Internal mammary nodes are involved in 20 to 40% of the patients, depending of the axillary involvement and location of the tumor inside the breast. Irradiation of the internal mammary basin is difficult: optimal dosimetry required a CT-based simulation. Its benefit remains to be proved. Internal mammary nodes irradiation probably increased cardiovascular mortality. Sophisticated techniques are needed to spare the heart from irradiation. Two large randomized trials (French group, European Organization for Research and Treatment of Cancer [EORTC]) are currently evaluating the possible benefit of internal mammary irradiation.","1618":"To summarize the major new findings in prostate cancer in radiation oncology in the last year. A review of the 2007 annual meetings of the ASCO, ASTRO, EAU, AUA annual congresses and bibliographic review. Incidence of prostate carcinoma is increasing in France (62 000 cases in 2005), but its mortality rate is stable (9202 deaths). This finding justified the active surveillance option for selected patients. For the initial staging or in case of biochemical relapse after surgery, the 11-C-choline PET\/CT has not today proven any meaningful clinical benefit. Dose escalation in exclusive external beam radiotherapy has now proven its potential interest in several randomized trials and also in some retrospective data: biochemical control is regularly increased in case of higher dose. Even if this dose escalation increased also toxicity, this is always acceptable. Some unconfirmed data suggested that this benefit in biochemical control is translated in a better clinical disease-free survival. The role of prophylactic nodal irradiation is still debated. On the other hand, in the unfavorable group, a long-term androgen deprivation (3 years at least) is more efficient than a short-term androgen deprivation in an EORTC randomized trial. In more advanced disease, discussion between imediate and deferred hormonal treatment is also a matter of debate; but it seems that patients with a PSA higher than 50 ng\/ml or a PSA doubling time lower than 12 months must received immediate hormonal manipulation. However, late effects of the hormonal treatment are now recognized: metabolic syndrom is often diagnosed after androgen deprivation and seems to increase cardio-vascular mortality. All local treatments had deleterious effects on quality of life and the initial conditions of the patients must be incorporated in the treatment choice. Last year has seen many publications on prostate cancer, some of them could impact on our clinical practice. ","1619":"Radiotherapy of glial tumors is rapidly evolving with the recent technical and therapeutic progress. About technical aspects, progress in technical imaging and development of non-coplanar conformal and IMRT techniques provide new possibilities for sparing healthy tissue while increasing dose in tumoral volume. Furthermore, functional and molecular imaging are helpful for delineation and for prediction of relapse. Even modest, the actual improvement of survival with radiochemotherapy leads now to new and important developments for clinical research according to clinical data (age, general status), biological data (MGMT promotor methylation and cytogenetic modifications) and technical data (quality of surgery and radiotherapy). Understanding of molecular mechanisms allows for rational targeting or specific pathways of repair, signaling angiogenesis associated with surgery and radiotherapy in a multidisciplinary approach.","1620":"The imaging of gliomas, as well as diffuse infiltrative gliomas or as more recently individualized entities, has been profoundly modified these last years. Correlated with the classic morphological MRI, numerous new sequences have appeared that allowed a more metabolic approach of the tumors, such as diffusion, perfusion--related to angiogenesis--and spectroscopy--reflecting metabolic data. Their development in daily practice allows to precise the diagnostic, to definite the more active areas (correlated with the hyperperfused or more metabolic active areas in relation with the Ki67 index) and so optimize the biopsy and\/or evaluate the evolution of the lesion. When associated, they allow also and perhaps especially to precise the diagnostic, particularly with other tumoral masses such as lymphomas or metastases that can present misleading patterns, but also with other more benign lesions such as abcesses. Always critically analysed, and reevaluated along the time if necessary, they can sometimes help the histological diagnosis, but never can be used in place of it.","1621":"Esophageal cancer is characterized by various degrees of lymph node invasion and metastasis, both of which are associated with a poor prognosis. Exclusive concomitant radiochemotherapy (RCT) at a dose of 50 Gy delivered over 25 sessions, according to the RTOG 85-01 protocol, has led to improved five-year survival in 25% of patients, whereas no patients survive for five years using radiotherapy alone. Surgery, even when combined with preoperative RCT, also gives disappointing results for locally advanced tumors, which casts serious doubts on the usefulness of preoperative radiotherapy. By varying the fractionation schedule, the length of treatment or the radiotherapy volumes, it has become possible to obtain levels of locoregional relapse of around 35 to 45%. The increasing incidence of adenocarcinoma, which differs from epidermoid cancer with regard to the degree of lymph node invasion, has revived discussion on radiotherapy volumes. Given this difference between these two histological forms, we propose here a number of recommendations concerning radiotherapy volumes for patients presenting with cancer of the esophagus. Finally, analysis of the results for locoregional relapse according to the dose of radiation and the recommended radiotherapy volumes, has led us to investigate why increasing the dose of radiation has no impact in esophageal cancers.","1622":"Several meta-analyses of the effects of radiotherapy in breast cancer were published. Methodological quality varied largely in these studies, from simply gathering data from published studies or even published abstracts, to more rigorous studies gathering individual data from each patient having participated in the trials analysed. A model of the latter is represented by the successive meta-analyses from the Early Breast Cancer Trialists' Cooperative Group (EBCTCG). These studies have had a strong impact on the clinical practice of radiotherapy in breast cancer, by demonstrating its long-term potential toxic effects, but also its ability to decrease the long-term breast-cancer mortality, regardless of the effects of other breast-cancer treatments. Therefore, it has contributed to the continuous improvement in the techniques of radiotherapy, as well as to its use in the multidisciplinary management of breast-cancer patients.","1623":"Surgical resection of gliomas is a well-established treatment. It allows a histo-genetic diagnosis, a mass effect reduction, an intracranial hypertension treatment, a recovery of an eventual neurological deficit induced by the mass effect, but mostly brings a significant survival. New imaging sequences are optimizing the surgical management of brain tumors by bringing precisions on the tumor morphology, on cortical\/subcortical eloquent areas (functional and diffusion MRI), on histology (spectroscopic MR). If the tumor is located in eloquent area, surgery is performed under electrostimulation control to take into account cerebral plasticity and to avoid postoperative functional deficits. Neuronavigation, per-operative echography, and per-operative MRI are recognized tools for optimizing the tumor resection. Ongoing researches concern the adjunction of local treatments within the surgical field (photodynamic therapy, chemotherapy, convection immunotherapy...), but also the development of minimal invasive procedures (radiosurgery, high intensity focalized ultrasounds, laser interstitial thermal therapy).","1624":"Gliomas are the most common primary brain tumors. Despite the implementation of therapeutic strategies, these tumors remain fatal. The recent advances in the field of stem cell biology, cell signaling, genomics, bio-informatics and genetic model systems have led to a better understanding of gliomas biology. These advances are facilitating the establishment of a more precise, molecular-based, classification of gliomas and are leading to new therapeutic strategies directed against the key molecular events implicated in gliomas oncogenesis.","1625":null,"1626":"Cancer in the elderly represents a major public health topic and its importance will increase in the future because of increased life expectancy and ageing. Cancer prognosis is worse due to late diagnosis, frequent comorbidities and treatment often considered as suboptimal. Reference treatments were primarily validated for younger or selected elderly patients and experimental data collected on most vulnerable are rare. Oncogeriatrics development for 15 years made it possible to consider two fundamental aspects, which are the geriatric evaluation, from the most simple to the complete one, and the development of specific trials. In addition, a strong institutional policy allowed promotion, on the French national territory, of regional experiments thanks to Pilot Units of Oncogeriatrics Coordination (UPCOG). The question of the interest of a geriatric evaluation in radiotherapy is related mainly to the difficulties of tolerance and observance of this treatment, but also with its effectiveness and this review explores the main curative, adjuvant and palliative indications as well as research perspectives.","1627":"Among all the accelerated and partial breast irradiation (APBI) techniques, low then high dose rate, interstitial brachytherapy (HDIB) was the first to be used in this field. This study presents the preliminary clinical and dosimetric results of the APBI using HDIB, performed in Antoine Lacassagne Cancer Center of Nice. From June 2004 to March 2008, 61 patients (37 primary tumors and 24 second conservative treatments after local recurrence) presenting with T1-2 pN0 non-lobular invasive breast carcinoma, underwent lumpectomy with sentinel lymph node dissection and intraoperative tube placement for HDIB. Dose distribution analysis, using dose-volume histograms, was achieved based on a postoperative CT scan. A comparative dosimetric study was performed between optimized (O) and non-optimized (NO) dose distribution. Then, based on conformal index calculation, a novel index was proposed taking into account not only the conformity but also the homogeneity of HDIB implant. An analysis of dose gradient impact on HDIB biological equivalence dose was also conducted. Statistical analysis used T test confirmed by Wilcoxon test for cohort including less than 30 patients. The comparative dosimetric analysis between O and NO dose distributions shown that conformity indexes (conformal index, conformal number, and D90%) were significantly increased after optimization. Improving conformity leads to increasing hyperdosage volumes (V150% and V200%). A new index named conformity and homogeneity index (CHI) including V150% values, modified the conformal index. A total dose of 34 Gy, delivered through HDIB in 10 fractions over five days was biologically equivalent to 41.93 Gy assuming alpha\/beta = 4 Gy and 75.76 Gy if the dose gradient was considered in the calculation. HDIB is considered as one of the best IPAS technique. HDIB allows dose distribution optimization, skin spearing and accurate clinical target volume definition. Furthermore, HDIB dose gradient could play a key role for breast cancer local control. ","1628":"Accidents which recently occured in external radiotherapy led the French Ministry of Health to implement a programme aimed at increasing quality and safety of treatments. We report the actions of the French society of radiation oncology in the field of this programme called Feuille de route.","1629":"The goal of this review is to briefly present the main recent advances of research in malignant gliomas and to consider future developments, in a clinical perspective. The main challenges appear to be the following: (1) To better understand the etiology of gliomas and to differentiate the respective roles of environmental and genetic factors. (2) To improve the diagnostic and follow up tools, not only through refined neuroimaging techniques but also by discovering serum biomarkers. (3) To build a reliable molecular classification of gliomas that may be used for diagnostic and therapeutic purposes. (4) To develop a \"molecular-based\" clinical research. Neuro-Oncology has now reached a new therapeutic era and many methodological and medico-economic questions need to be solved.","1630":null,"1631":"Brachytherapy is one of the standard treatments of head and neck cancers. The main indications are: the oral cavity, the oropharynx, the lips, the peri-orificial skin carcinomas on the face, the postoperative treatments for T1-2\/N0 cancers of the oral cavity with close or positive margins, the second cancers in previously irradiated areas, the intra-operative brachytherapy for recurrent cervical lymph node metastases from previously irradiated tissues after maximal surgical debulking. The major prognostic factors published allowed to improve the technique: using a leaded protection of the mandible, the intersource spacing (1,2-1,4 cm), the volume treated (30 cm3, i.e. three loops), the safety margin (5 mm), the dose rate (0,5 Gy\/h), the total dose (65 Gy in case of exclusive brachytherapy, 25 Gy in case of a combination of external beam irradiation [50 Gy] and brachytherapy in the oropharyngeal carcinomas, 35 Gy in case of a combination of external beam irradiation [40 Gy] and brachytherapy in the oral cavity carcinomas, 60 Gy in case of a second cancer in previous irradiated tissues), the delay between external irradiation and brachytherapy (&lt; 20 days). The pulse dose rate brachytherapy should improve results with the control of the dose rate and the optimization of the dose distribution. For high dose rate brachytherapy, more results are needed to recommend this technique for routine use.","1632":"In breast cancer, optimal locoregional treatment allows high local control rates and impact long-term survival. The Early Breast Cancer Trialists Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) meta-analysis data showed that radiation therapy (RT) can decrease the risk of breast cancer death at 15 years. In the adjuvant setting, whole breast RT remains the standard of care. Adjuvant systemic therapies, RT indications, techniques and volumes are determined according to the known standard prognosis factors such as age, tumor size and location, nodal involvement, grade, hormone receptors status, proliferative index and lymphovascular invasion. One of the future challenges in breast cancer management is to determine new prognosis and predictive factors that could help to define the subgroups of patients, who will either really benefit from new treatment strategies or particular RT techniques, or for those for whom aggressive local therapeutic option is not needed, as their prognosis is mainly related to an early risk of metastatic diffusion. In the new era of fine biological diagnosis, a better understanding of tumor biology allows a significant development of targeted therapies. Adjuvant strategies including locoregional RT have to be based on the tailored treatment concept. These strategies have to take into account not only the patients profiles regarding the well-established parameters, but also the tumor biology, the new breast cancer subtype classification and gene profiles.","1633":"The aim of this study is to analyze the results and the complications of radiotherapy in the treatment of retinoblastoma. Between 1994 and 2004, 40 children received radiotherapy for a retinoblastoma in Salah Azaiz Institute. The average age of the patients was 36 months (four to 132 months). There were 16 girls and 24 boys. Sixteen children presented a bilateral disease and 24 children a unilateral disease. Twenty eyes and thirty-six orbital cavities in 40 children with retinoblastoma were treated by radiotherapy. One child with a unilateral anterior retinoblastoma was treated with 106 ruthenium brachytherapy. External radiotherapy has been used to treat the 39 patients. In 20 cases the irradiation was conservative and in 36 cases postoperatively. The latter (n=36) presented at least one risk factor of relapses noted in the histological examination. The average dose was 44 Gy (1.8 to 2 Gy per fraction, five fractions weekly). This radiotherapy was associated with chemotherapy in 24 cases. Thirty-five children were followed with an average follow-up of 53 months (3-108 months). The average delay of relapses was of 10 months (two to 26 months). We found four orbital relapses and seven metastasis in nine children. The conservation of the eye with a useful visual field was noted in 18 cases among the 20 conservative irradiated eyes. The major therapeutic complication was the growth defect of the bones face. A femoral bone sarcoma was noted five years after the end of the irradiation and chemotherapy in one case. If the radiotherapy offers the advantage of the functional conservation and the improvement of the local control, its indications are more and more restricted in favor of the other therapeutic methods (chemotherapy, thermochemotherapy) and this considering the iatrogene risk. The development of new techniques of brachytherapy and the progresses of the conformational radiotherapy appear to reduce considerably this risk. ","1634":"Brachytherapy plays an important role in the treatment of patients with gynaecological cancers. At the Institut Gustave-Roussy, the technique of vaginal mould applicator has been used for decades. This technique allows a personalized tailored irradiation, integrating tumour shape, size and extension and vaginal anatomy. Vaginal expansion reduces the dose to the vaginal mucosa and to the organs at risk. We report a modification of the material used for vaginal mould manufacture. The advantages of the new material are a lighter weight, and transparency allowing a better accuracy in the placement of catheters for radioactive sources. This material is applicable for low dose-rate, pulse dose-rate and high dose-rate brachytherapy. Since 2001, more than 700 vaginal moulds have been manufactured with this new approach without any intolerance.","1635":"The treatment of patients with endometrial cancer is rapidly evolving. Literature data give more information on prognostic factors, allowing treatment stratification. If treatment has become less heavy in early-stage disease, therapeutic approaches have become more aggressive in more advanced disease. In this situation, treatment combines external irradiation and chemotherapy. Despite these advances, numerous questions remain on the best therapeutic sequence. Optimal chemotherapy regimens remain to be determined. On-going randomized trials will help to answer these questions.","1636":null,"1637":"In gastric cancer treatment, the recent advances concern mainly the lymphadenectomy and adjuvant or neoadjuvant treatment of surgical resection. Progressively in western countries, the D1 lymphadenectomy is performed in large population with an improvement of survival rate of patients. Recently, in two randomized studies, a significantly decrease of recurrence with hazard ratio near of 0.70 has been demonstrate with perioperative chemotherapy. However, the post-operative chemoradiotherapy shown too, in prospective randomized study, a significantly benefit on recurrence risk with hazard ratio of 0.50. In fact, feasibility of postoperative chemoradiotherapy was weak, near to 65%. The preoperative chemoradiotherapy is a promising alternative. A phase II study of preoperative chemoradiotherapy is ongoing by french intergroup. The design with two parallel groups evaluate the feasibility of chemotherapy (FOLFIRI) and then chemoradiotherapy (45 Gy, 5FUIVc) in postoperative or preoperative period.","1638":"Postorchidectomy management of stage I testis seminoma has evolved for many years. Three treatment options should be discussed after surgery. Surveillance tends toward taking a more significant place to avoid overtreatment, adjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin has demonstrated its efficiency, and for some, preventive radiotherapy, the historical reference treatment, is losing momentum. Whatever the chosen orientation, long-term prognosis is excellent with overall survival closed to 100%. In this context, this review underlines the advantages and the drawbacks of the three attitudes but also the unknowns relative to each. Indeed, their knowledge is crucial for informing clearly and with an objective way. Without gold-standard, but with three therapeutic options available, informing our patients is the key so they make an informed choice in dialogue with the oncologist.","1639":"To investigate the impact of the boost dose to the primary tumour bed in the framework of breast conserving therapy on local control, cosmetic results, fibrosis and overall survival for patients with early stage breast cancer. Five thousand five hundred and sixty-nine patients after lumpectomy followed by whole breast irradiation of 50 Gy were randomised. After a microscopically complete lumpectomy (5318 patients), the boost doses were either 0 or 16 Gy, while after a microscopically incomplete (251 patients) lumpectomy randomisation was between 10 and 26 Gy. The results at a median follow-up of 10 years are presented. At 10 years, the cumulative incidence of local recurrence was 10.2% versus 6.2% for the 0 Gy and the 16 Gy boost groups (p &lt; 0.0001) and 17.5% versus 10.8% for the 10 and 26 Gy boost groups, respectively (p &gt; 0.1). There was no statistically significant interaction per age group but recurrences tended to occur earlier in younger patients. As younger patients had a higher cumulative risk of local relapse by year 10, the magnitude of the absolute 10-year risk reduction achieved with the boost decreased with increasing age. Development of fibrosis was significantly dependent on the boost dose with a 10-year rate for severe fibrosis of 1.6% after 0 Gy, 3.3% after 10 Gy, 4.4% after 16 Gy and 14.4% after 26 Gy, respectively. An increase of the dose with 16 Gy improved local control for patients after a complete lumpectomy only. The development of fibrosis was clearly dose dependent. With 10 years median follow-up, no impact of survival was observed. ","1640":"In 2005, a French multicentric-prospective study (\"STIC PDR\") was initiated for patients treated for cervix carcinoma comparing brachytherapy method based on orthogonal X-rays (2D group) or based on 3D-imaging and PDR Brachytherapy (3D group). The study has ended after 2.5 years accrual and the enrollment of 801 patients. We will describe the first 637 patients. Two hundred and eighty-eight patients were included in the 2D group and 349 in the 3D group. Three subgroups of patients have been defined: brachytherapy-surgery (159 patients); external-beam radiotherapy (EBRT)-brachytherapy-surgery (264 patients); EBRT-brachytherapy (214 patients). Clinical data were comparable between 2D and 3D groups in each subgroup. In both groups, ICRU bladder and rectal points were drawned; in the 3D group, CTV volumes were delineated according to GYN-GEC-ESTRO recommendations (high-risk CTV and intermediate-risk CTV), as were the external wall of the OARs. The dose to 100 (D100) and 90% (D90) of CTV and the volume of CTV receiving 60 Gy (V60) were analysed. Brachytherapy: for each subgroup, results are comparable between 2D and 3D (isodose 60 Gy volume, dose to ICRU bladder and rectal points, TRAK). In the 3D group, CTV coverage was lower than GEC-ESTRO recommendations. Surgical data: the same proportion of patients were in complete-cervical pathologic remission between 2D and 3D groups (54 and 55%). There was no difference in coverage of CTVs between complete and partial remission in the 3D group. The first results of the \"STIC PDR\" study show that physicians did not modify to a large extent their mode of prescription while evolving towards 3D brachytherapy. The follow-up of the patients will lead to precious data in the 3D group about the relationship between DVHs, late complications and local control. ","1641":"The impact of curative radiotherapy depends mainly on the total dose delivered homogenously in the targeted volume. Nevertheless, the dose delivery is limited by the tolerated dose of the surrounding healthy tissues. Two different side effects (acute and late) can occur during and after radiotherapy. Of particular interest are the radiation-induced sequelae due to their irreversibility and the potential impact on daily quality of life. In a population treated in one center with the same technique, it appears that individual radiosensitivity clearly exists. In the hypothesis that genetic is involved in this area of research, lymphocytes seem to be the tissue of choice due to easy accessibility. Recently, low percentage of CD4 and CD8 lymphocyte apoptosis were shown to be correlated with high grade of sequelae. In addition, recent data suggest that patients with severe radiation-induced late side effects possess four or more SNP in candidate genes (ATM, SOD2, TGFB1, XRCC1 et XRCC3) and low radiation-induced CD8 lymphocyte apoptosis in vitro.","1642":"Post-operative concomitant chemoradiotherapy is now a standard of care for locally advanced gastric carcinomas. Definition of target volumes is based on natural history of the disease and on analysis of the sites of local relapses. This paper summarized the general principles of target delineation, in a conformal approach.","1643":"High dose rate (HDR) afterloading brachytherapy in the management of localised prostate cancer has practical, physical and biological advantages over low dose rate seed brachytherapy. There are no free live sources used, no risk of source loss and since the implant is a temporary procedure following discharge no issues with regard to radioprotection use of existing facilities. Adequate coverage of extracapsular and seminal vesicle tumour is possible for advanced cases and HDR brachytherapy is the most efficient means of obtaining dose escalation in terms of biological dose based on a low alpha\/beta ratio. Selection for HDR brachytherapy includes patients with any prostate specific antigen (PSA) level provided there is no demonstrable metastasis, any Gleason score and stages T1B to T3B. The results of a randomised trial show that HDR brachytherapy is an effective means of dose escalation with a favourable therapeutic ratio when compared with standard external beam radiotherapy. Current studies are evaluating HDR brachytherapy as monotherapy delivering a radical dose in two to four fractions. The acute toxicity with HDR brachytherapy is short-lived and far less severe than seen with low dose rate brachytherapy and late toxicity rates are low.","1644":"Interpatient heterogeneity in normal tissue reactions varies considerably, yet the genetic determinants and the molecular mechanisms of therapeutic radiation sensitivity remain poorly understood. Predictive assays and markers for normal tissue reactions are still in their infancy, although some progress has been made, particularly, for predicting late toxicity. For instance the T-lymphocyte radiation-induced apoptosis assay was shown to significantly predict differences in late toxicity between individuals and an 18 gene classifier based on radiation-induced expression in subcutaneous fibroblasts has also been identified that differentiated between patients with a high and low risk of radiation-induced fibrosis. However, the technical set-up for gene expression measurements means that this latter assay is unlikely to be introduced soon into a routine clinical setting but has importantly allowed the identification of genes that are involved in the fibrotic process. Serum markers have also been identified that show potential for the prediction of patients who will develop acute and late pulmonary toxicity. Few genetic predictive markers for normal tissue reaction have been identified and validated. Many of the single nucleotide polymorphism association studies have been limited by size and the inclusion of subjects with different kinds of radiation morbidity. International collaboration to assemble well-defined cohorts and technological progress should mean that the identification and validation of such markers using candidate gene approaches and whole genome association studies, which have been successful in other research areas, will make rapid progress.","1645":"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) is a rare neuroendocrine carcinoma of the skin with features of epithelial differentiation. It occurs in older patients, appears on sun exposed areas and its incidence is increasing. The surgical excision with negative margins is the first treatment and adjuvant local irradiation now is well established but regional adjuvant (lymph nodes dissection or radiation therapy) remains discussed. MCC is chemosensitive but rarely chemocurable in patients with metastasis or locally advanced tumors. The most used therapy is platinum-based polychemotherapy.","1646":"Most endometrial cancers are diagnosed at stage I (disease limited to the uterine corpus). The definitive treatment for endometrial carcinoma consists in total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy with or without lymphadenectomy. The decision of adjuvant treatment depends on risk factors. Postoperative radiotherapy plays a major role in the management of stage I endometrial cancer but the respective place of external radiotherapy and vaginal brachytherapy remains controversial. Adjuvant external beam radiotherapy reduces locoregional recurrences, but carries a risk of toxicity without overall survival benefits. Recent data suggest that vaginal brachytherapy is effective in preventing vaginal recurrence with lower toxicity and should be the treatment of choice for intermediate risk endometrial cancer.","1647":"High-dose robotic stereotactic irradiation can be achieved with high precision using the CyberknifeM system equipped with the Synchrony respiratory tracking device. Cyberknife irradiation can overcome some limitations of conventional radiotherapy including errors due to breathing motion and patient setup. High dose levels are of interest for tumours that have shown a dose-response relationship including lung tumours. We reviewed the treatments and outcomes for the first French patients with lung tumours treated at the Cyberknife centre of Nice. Thirty four patients were treated between November 2006 and November 2007 at the Cyberknife centre of Nice, Centre Lacassagne, France. Thirty had untreated primary lung cancer, 4 had colorectal metastasis to the lung. We evaluated the feasibility and reliability of fiducial placement, toxicity and early outcomes. Objective tumour response was assessed on thoracic CT scan every three months. There was no grade 3-4 toxicity. Toxicity (11%) mainly consisted of grade 1-2 asthenia. Crude overall tumour response rate was 96% for all assessable patients and 91% at 3 and 6 months, respectively. The use of one fiducial ensured minimal toxicity (no grade III pneumothorax) while allowing reliable tumour tracking as shown by the low infield failure rate (no geographic miss). Diagnostic procedure was performed during fiducial placement when required. Early toxicity and tumour control rates from this population suggest that the use of a unique fiducial for a Cyberknife treatment was safe and effective for the treatment of selected primary and secondary lung tumours. This strategy is corroborated by similar control rates in the literature. Longer follow-up are awaited. ","1648":"Ductal carcinoma in situ is defined as breast cancer confined to the ducts of the breast without evidence of penetration of the basement membrane. Local treatment quality represents one of the most prognostic factors as half of recurrences are invasive diseases. The main goal of adjuvant radiotherapy after conservative surgery is to decrease local recurrences and to permit breast conservation with low treatment-induced sequelae. Several randomized trials have established the impact of 50 Gy to the whole breast in terms of local control. Nevertheless, no randomized trial is still available concerning the role of the boost in this disease. In this review, we present updated results of the literature and we detail the French multicentric randomized trial evaluating the impact of a 16 Gy boost after 50 Gy delivered to the whole breast in 25 fractions and 33 days. This protocol will start inclusions in October 2008.","1649":"Breast mucinous carcinoma is a particular histological form characterized by the extracellular production of mucus. The pure form is rarely reported and its prognostic is better than the other types of the breast cancer. The aim of the present study was to discuss the various anatomoclinical, therapeutic aspects and the prognostic factors of the pure mucinous carcinoma of the breast. We report seven cases diagnosed over a period of 11 years (1993-2003) in the laboratory of anatomy and pathological cytology of the university hospital of Sfax. A review of the clinical files with immunohistochemistry study (hormonal receptor, synaptophysine, chromogranine, Bcl2, Ki67, P53 and Her-2\/neu (C-erbB-2)) were carried out for all the cases. pure colloid carcinoma of the breast accounted for 0,5% of the whole of the breast cancers. The average age of patients was 69 years. At the time of the diagnosis, four tumours were classified T4, one T3, two T2, two N1 and one N3; no patient had presented metastasis (M0) according to pTNM classification. The echomammography showed regular contours mass in four cases. The anatomopathological study showed that the neuroendocrine differentiation was found in two cases, all the tumours had presented positivity for the hormonal receptors (oestrogen and progesterone) and negativity for the other antibodies, two cases exhibited the Bcl2 positivity and negativity for the other antibodies. An adjuvant radiotherapy was carried out for all the patients. The average duration of follow-up was of 33 months; the evolution was marked by the occurrence of metastases in two cases. The pure colloid carcinoma of the breast constitutes a particular morphological entity which deserves to be individualized; neuroendocrine differentiation of these tumours must be required. Their forecast is relatively favourable. ","1650":"To evaluate the use of radiation therapy for the prevention of heterotopic ossification. Twenty-two patients, 20 to 76 years old were irradiated for the prevention of heterotopic ossification. All patients received a postoperative irradiation consisting of 700 cGy delivered by 18 MV photons using a linear accelerator. The delay between surgery and irradiation was 24 hours for 20 patients, 48 hours for three patients, 72 hours for two patients and 96 hours for one patient. The follow-up of all patients was based on radiologic findings (Brooker score) as well as the clinical status of the articulation before and after surgery. Of the 14 cases for which follow-up data was available, seven received primary prophylaxis and seven received secondary prophylaxis. Heterotopic ossification prophylaxis using radiation therapy was radiologically successful in 71.5% of patients: 85.7% success for patients receiving primary prophylaxis and 57.1% success for patients receiving secondary prophylaxis. No functional failure was reported. No patient developed radiation related side effects. Radiation therapy is proven to be effective in preventing heterotopic ossification. A larger study group is needed in order to compare our results with those seen in the literature. ","1651":"FDG-(18F) PET can now be usually included in the treatment strategy of esophageal cancers for the pretreatment staging in operable tumours or for the diagnosis of recurrence. PET is also a good tool in conformal radiation therapy for improving the target coverage to treat the metabolic target volume or the biological target volume. Furthermore, PET seems to be interesting for evaluation of tumour response and could modify the treatment strategy after neoadjuvant chemotherapy or concurrent chemotherapy and radiation therapy. New radiotracers could allow advances in biological and molecular tumour delineation and contribute to change in treatment strategy based on functional and biological imaging.","1652":"Cancer is a disease that predominantly occurs in older patients who represent a quarter of the population in western countries. Numerous types of cancer are observed in elderly people. Radiotherapy is one of the most powerful treatment against cancer. Most of published studies have demonstrated feasibility of radiotherapy in curative or palliative intent whatever cancer types are considered. Complete geriatric assessment and a multidisciplinary approach are the key points. The purpose of this review is to highlight sights of radiation oncology specifically related to aging. Particular emphasis is placed on logistic and technical aspects of radiation. Special techniques are also reviewed that have particular relevance to the treatment of the elderly.","1653":"This paper presents the development of a protocol for quality control of a megavoltage cone beam CT imaging system (MVCB) mounted on a Siemens Oncor 6MV linear accelerator. Several parameters were controlled on the MVCB system: (1) the initial geometric calibration of the system; (2) the quality of the images (geometric distortion, uniformity, spatial resolution, low contrast resolution) for various protocols; (3) the correspondence between the intensity of voxels and electronic densities; (4) the dose delivered when achieving a MVCB. These tests were done mainly with two cylindrical phantoms specific to the quality control (QC) of a MVCB system, supplied by Siemens, and with the Catphan 600 phantom (The Phantom Laboratory) and Quasar Multipurpose Body phantom (Modus Medical Devices Inc). The results of the quality control of the images were within the tolerances. The use of the Catphan 600 phantom was inadequate for the QC of MVCB images. These tests also highlighted the need to correct the MVCB images for the \"cupping artefact\" for dose calculation purpose. The initial characteristics of the MVCB imaging system were established. Such testing also provided the assessment of the influence of various parameters on the image quality as well as the associated dose delivered during their acquisition, and emphasized the corrections needed to use MVCB images for dose calculation.

The optimal management, especially with irradiation, was not definitively determined in the eighth and ninth decades. The Association of French-speaking neuro-oncologists (Anocef) has recently conducted a randomized clinical trial comparing radiotherapy plus supportive care versus supportive care alone in such patients. Patients aged 70-years and older with newly diagnosed glioblastoma and a Karnofsky performance score of 70 or above were randomly assigned to receive focal irradiation in daily fraction of 1.8 Gy given five days per week for a total dose of 50 Gy plus supportive care or supportive care only. Radiotherapy resulted in a modest but significant improvement in overall survival without reducing quality of life or cognition. However, the optimal regimen of radiotherapy in this fragile population remains uncertain. Abbreviated course of radiotherapy (40 Gy in 15 fractions over 19 days) has been proposed. Analysis of preliminary results showed that efficacy and safety of this hypofractionated accelerated regimen compared favourably with those of classically fractionated treatments. Finally, the potential contribution of surgery and chemotherapy should be evaluated in prospective clinical trials.","1658":"Since 20 years, treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis has been developed in expert centers. Cytoreductive surgery and perioperative intraperitoneal chemotherapy, especially hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy, was assessed by many nonrandomised studies for the treatment of peritoneal carcinomatosis arising from gastric cancer. Results described increased survival, especially for the most favourable cases: limited carcinomatosis and complete cytoreductive surgery. A strict selection of the patients is necessary because of the important morbidity of those treatments. Only patients with good general health, able to tolerate a threatening treatment, with possible complete cytoreduction, may benefit from those treatments. Many japanese studies had demonstrated the efficacy of hyperthermic intraperitoneal chemotherapy for the prophylactic treatment of carcinomatosis in advanced-gastric cancers. These results have to be confirmed by european randomised studies.","1659":"To evaluate the amplitude of motion and the variations of volume of the tumor, the liver and upper abdominal organs induced by breathing during the irradiation of hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Two scanners were performed in inhale and in exhale not forced in 20 patients with a HCC. The liver (left\/right lobes), the tumor, the duodenum, the two kidneys and the pancreas were delineated on each acquisition. The superposition of the two spirals made it possible to measure the displacements and variations of volume of these structures in the craniocaudal (CC), lateral (Lat), and anteroposterior (AP) directions. The mean displacement of the tumour in CC, Lat and AP was of 19.7+\/-8.3 mm, 4.5+\/-2.3 mm, and 8.9+\/-6.5 mm. The greatest amplitude of movement was obtained in CC for the right and left hepatic lobes (19+\/-6.5 mm, 10+\/-5.6 mm), the duodenum(12.6+\/-6.4 mm), the kidneys right and left (15.5+\/-6.1 mm, 16.2+\/-10 mm) and the pancreas (13.2+\/-6 mm). No significant variation of volume was observed for these organs. The movements of the tumour, the liver and the abdominal organs, induced by breathing are significant. The respiratory gating appears essential in particular with the development of new techniques of irradiation such as the intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) or the stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT). ","1660":"","1661":"The patient positioning and repositioning control in radiation therapy all along the treatment can be conducted using a variety of X-ray sources and imaging detector devices. The development of image guided radiation therapy techniques leads to more frequent use of this imaging control. In this article we summarize the current methods for measuring the dose delivered by X-ray imaging devices used in radiation therapy, as well as basic proposals to take account of these imaging doses for prescribing, recording and reporting radiation therapy treatment.","1662":"","1663":"Analysis of the feasibility and results of adjuvant chemotherapy followed by conformal chemoradiotherapy after surgery for gastric carcinoma. Twenty-six patients (R0 or R1) were treated postoperatively by three cycles of 5-fluorouracil (5-FU) and cisplatin, followed by a concomitant association of LV5FU2 chemotherapy with a conformal radiotherapy of 45 Gy. The tumor was classified pT3-T4 in 77% of the patients and 92.5% had a nodal involvement (pN1: 54%; pN2: 31%). (1) Adjuvant chemotherapy: nausea\/vomiting grade II\/III: 12 patients (48%); neutropenia grade III\/IV: two patients; completed in all patients, except one. (2) Chemoradiotherapy: nausea\/vomiting grade II\/III: 10 patients; diarrhea grade II\/3: two patients; oesophagitis grade II\/III: two patients; myocardial infarction\/pulmonary embolism: two patients. All patients except one received the planned dose of 45Gy. Radiotherapy was interrupted in six cases, with a median duration of 14 days. Survival: with a median follow-up of 30 months, 65% of the patients were alive without disease; median survival was 32 months. This postoperative schedule was judged feasible. It allowed the deliverance of a more intensified chemotherapy than the classical schedule. Its clinical benefit must be evaluated in a phase III trial. ","1664":"Medulloblastoma is a common paediatric brain tumor. Its prognosis is improved since the use of radiotherapy after surgery. This radiotherapy, so widely and complex, has one purpose: tumor control with less toxicity. Frontal relapse of medulloblastoma is not rare. Two hypothesis were proposed to explain this failure pattern: a geographic miss in cribriform plate due to targeting deviation and the migration of tumor cells to the cribriform plate caused by the \"face down position\" of the patient during surgery. We report the case of a 10-year-old boy who was treated in 1998 for a medulloblastoma with surgery and radiotherapy of the craniospinal axis (24 Gy) and the posterior fossa (54 Gy). Four years later, tumor relapsed only in the frontal area. A new surgery and chemotherapy were used with a complete response. A second frontal relapse associated with posterior fossa recurrence was detected after one year of the second treatment and treated by chemotherapy. Frontal relapse in medulloblastoma is an avoidable failure pattern when surgical and radiotherapeutic procedures are well controlled.","1665":"The aim of the present study was to quantitatively assess the performance of a block matching-based automatic registration algorithm integrated within the commercial treatment planning system designated ISOgray from Dosisoft. The accuracy of the process was evaluated by a phantom study on computed tomography (CT), magnetic resonance (MR) and positron emission tomography (PET) images. Two phantoms were used to carry out this study: the cylindrical Jaszczak phantom and the anthropomorphic Liqui-Phil Head Phantom (the Phantom Laboratory), containing fillable spheres. External fiducial markers were used to quantify the accuracy of 41 CT\/CT, MR\/CT and PET\/CT automatic registrations with images of the rotated and tilted phantoms. The study first showed that a cylindrical phantom was not adapted for the evaluation of the performance of a block matching-based registration software. Secondly, the Liqui-Phil Head Phantom study showed that the algorithm was able to perform automatic registrations of CT\/CT and MR\/CT images with differences of up to 40 degrees in phantom rotation and of up to 20-30 degrees for PET\/CT with accuracy below the image voxel size. The study showed that the block matching-based automatic registration software under investigation was robust, reliable and yielded very satisfactory results. This phantom-based test can be integrated into a periodical quality assurance process and used for any commissioning of image registration software for radiation therapy. ","1666":"Primary epidural cervical non-hodgkin's low-grade lymphomas is exceptional. We report a 43-year-old woman admitted for a total functional disability of the four limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a cervical epidural mass C2-C3. A laminectomy was performed. The histological study revealed a small cells lymphoma. The patient underwent chemotherapy and radiotherapy. There was a favourable evolution. She is in complete remission with a follow-up of two years. We review literature to describe epidemiological, clinical and therapeutic features with evolutive aspects in primary epidural non-hodgkin's lymphomas.","1667":"","1668":"The prostate specific antigen test has become one of the most popular blood test. However, its result should be analyzed with caution due to physiologic variability. The PSA test is performed for prostate cancer (PC) screening or for post-treatment PC surveillance. According to the applied treatment (surgery or radiation therapy with or without hormonal therapy), PSA analysis can confirm biochemical control or relapse. New PSA data regarding the evolution of this biomarker during the surveillance (PSA doubling time and PSA velocity) are now important to consider in case of biochemical relapse.","1669":null,"1670":"Merkel cell carcinoma (MCC) are rare neuroendocrine malignant tumor of the skin, occurring in elderly patients. It affects primarily the sun-exposed areas of the skin, with approximately 50% of all tumors occurring in the face and neck and 40% in the extremities. Immunohistochemical markers (CK20+, CK7- and TTF1-) are used to distinguish between MCC and other tumors. MCC have a tendency to rapid local progression, frequent spread to regional lymph nodes and distant metastases. Due to the rarity of the disease, the optimal treatment has not been fully defined. Localized stages (stages I and II) are treated by surgical excision of the primary tumor (with 2 to 3 cm margin) and lymphadenectomy in case of node-positive disease, followed by external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) to a total dose of 50 to 60Gy in the tumor bed. Adjuvant EBRT has been shown to decrease markedly locoregional recurrences and to increase survival in recent studies. Treatment of lymph nodes area is more controversial. Chemotherapy is recommended only for metastatic disease.","1671":"Different materials have been studied in order to produce the epithermal neutron beam between 1eV and 10KeV, which are extensively used to irradiate patients with brain tumors such as GBM. For this purpose, we have studied three different neutrons moderators (H(2)O, D(2)O and BeO) and their combinations, four reflectors (Al(2)O(3), C, Bi, and Pb) and two filters (Cd and Bi). Results of calculation showed that the best obtained assembly configuration corresponds to the combination of the three moderators H(2)O, BeO and D(2)O jointly to Al(2)O(3) reflector and two filter Cd+Bi optimize the spectrum of the epithermal neutron at 72%, and minimize the thermal neutron to 4% and thus it can be used to treat the deep tumor brain. The calculations have been performed by means of the Monte Carlo N (particle code MCNP 5C). Our results strongly encourage further studying of irradiation of the head with epithermal neutron fields.","1672":"Purpose was to optimize and to estimate the dose delivered to the foetus during a postoperative irradiation of a 5-month twin pregnant woman presenting with adenocarcinoma of the right parotid. The treatment protocol aimed to deliver 66 Gy conformal radiation therapy on the tumour bed associated to a prophylactic irradiation of 50 Gy on the upper cervical nodes. A series of measurements allowed to estimate the delivered dose in the abdomen by the means of an ion chamber inserted in a water phantom placed side by side of an anthropomorphic Alderson Rando phantom simulating the body of the patient from the head to the pelvis. An appropriate optimisation of the number and orientation of beams were performed in order to minimize the peripheral dose, which is mostly dependent of the total number of monitor unit per fraction: cervical nodes and tumour site included in the same fields, limitation of the irradiated volume, 6 MV X-ray beams rather than Cobalt beams. The measured doses at the upper, in the middle and at the lower part of the abdomen were 17.0, 11.0 and 11.9 mGy, respectively, for the entire treatment, representing 0.025, 0.016 and 0.017%, respectively of the prescribed dose. The actions conducted to optimise the treatment allowed to lower doses delivered to the foetus under the limits proposed by international recommendations (100 mGy). Thus, the treatment of the pregnant patient had been performed with a minimized risk for the foetus.","1673":"Megavoltage CT (MVCT) study on helical tomotherapy permits to verify and correct the patient setup by coregistration with the planning kVCT. This process is time-consuming and our objective is to investigate a possibility of using a smaller number of imaging studies in the case of patients with prostate cancer. The interfraction shifts of 20 patients (about 700 MVCT studies) treated in our institution have been recorded and analyzed. A new reference position has been calculated as an average of shifts observed during different initial number of fractions imaged. The analysis of the reference position obtained for the set of 20 patients as a function of the number of imaging sessions has shown that MVCT studies during first four fractions are sufficient for the majority of patients. Imaging during the first four fractions can be used to determine a reference position for patients with prostate cancer treated on helical tomotherapy. A study on Planned Adaptive (TomoTherapy Inc., Madison, WI, USA) software to evaluate the clinical significance of this scenario is currently in process in our institution. ","1674":"An automatic segmentation tool of pelvic structures from MRI images for prostate cancer radiotherapy was developed and dosimetric evaluation of differences of delineation (automatic versus human) is presented here. CTV, rectum and bladder were defined automatically and by a physician in 20 patients. Treatment plans based on \"automatic\" volumes were transferred on \"manual\" volumes and reciprocally. Dosimetric characteristics of PTV (V(95), minimal, maximal and mean doses), rectum (V(50), V(70), maximal and mean doses) and bladder (V(70), maximal and mean doses) were compared. Automatic delineation of CTV did not significantly influence dosimetric characteristics of \"manual\" PTV. Rectal V(50) and V(70) were not significantly different; mean rectal dose is slightly superior (43.2 versus 44.4Gy, p=0.02, Student test). Bladder V(70) was significantly superior too (19.3 versus 21.6, p=0.004). Organ-at-risk (OAR) automatic delineation had little influence on their dosimetric characteristics; rectal V(70) was slightly underestimated (20 versus 18.5Gy, p=0.001). CTV and OAR automatic delineation had little influence on dosimetric characteristics. Software developments are ongoing to enable routine use and interobserver evaluation is needed. ","1675":"To analyse the management and clinical outcome of patients treated for retroperitonal soft tissue sarcoma and to identify prognosis factors. This is a retrospective study of 20 adults ; 11 women and nine men treated between 1980 and 2000 in our institution. There were seven liposarcomas and 13 leiomyosarcomas. The mean tumor size was 26 cm. Three patients underwent a complete resection (R0), 14 patients an incomplete resection (R1\/R2) with microscopic or macroscopic tumour remained after surgery. Only three patients had a surgical biopsy. Median follow-up was 18 months. Overall survival rates was 45%, 10% at two and five years, respectively. Among the following factors, sex, age, symptom duration, tumor size, histologic type, histologic grade, resection type, mitotic index, necrosis extension, histologic differentiation, and AJCC stage, only mitotic index factor (scale 1,2 versus scale 3) significantly influenced patient survival (p = 0.02). This study re-emphasizes the poor outcome of patients with retroperitoneal sarcoma. Survival rates appeared low when compared with other studies. These results incite for a more aggressive approach. ","1676":"Adenocarcinoma of the oesophagogastric junction has an ominous prognosis. Until now, oesophageal adenocarcima care was close to the squamous cell cancer one whereas adenocarcinoma of the cardia was mixed with gastric cancers. Results from randomised studies mixed them without making distinctions. Nevertheless, context, natural history and clinical outcome differ. Five-year survival rate is around 40 %, all stages included. Results from several phase-III studies or meta-analysis allowed to define three therapeutic strategies applicable to adenocarcinoma of the oesophagus and the oesophagogastric junction. In Europe, in the case of a resectable tumour, preoperative chemotherapy became a standard treatment since results from the Magic trial. In the United States, post-operative radiochemotherapy according to the \"Macdonald\" scheme is used in case of a resected tumour with a R0 surgery. Actually, modern techniques of irradiation could reduce the rate of gastro-intestinal toxicities. The survival benefit from preoperative radiochemotherapy is still very controversial with high rates of postoperative morbidity and mortality. We have performed a review of the literature with a methodological analysis of data with a high level of evidence in order to advise perioperative treatment guidelines for patients with a resectable adenocarcinoma of the lower oesophagus or gastro-oesophageal junction. Results from pre- or postoperative strategies and the role of radiotherapy will need to be analysed in the future through a randomised study.","1677":"There is no consensus about the treatment of rectal tumour when there are synchronous metastases. The interest of radiotherapy is debated. Thirty-seven patients with rectal tumour and synchronous metastases were treated with radiotherapy first between September 1994 and December 2004. We analysed the tolerance, local control, resecability, overall survival of such a therapeutic strategy. The mean follow-up was 30 months. Twenty-four tumors were resecable for both the primary site and the metastases. Thirteen were unresecable at the time of diagnosis. Thirty-three patients were treated with radiochemotherapy, ten with radiotherapy alone. Eighty-six decimal five percent of them had no pelvic symptom six weeks after the treatment. Twenty-one rectal tumours were finally resected. The disease progressed in six cases during the radiotherapy. Surgery of the metastases was possible for 12 patients with tumour initially resecable. Radiochemotherapy is a \"tolerable\" treatment, in spite of more frequent urinary or digestive side-effects. But, if there is no surgery, palliative effect of radiotherapy is limited. ","1678":"The breast metastases resulting of vulvar carcinoma are very rare, and represent exceptionally the first manifestation of the disease. We report the case of a 42 year-old patient who underwent a treatment because of vulvar epidermoid carcinoma, right away metastatic at the level of the inguinal ganglia. The treatment consisted in a total vulvectomy with bilateral ganglial curretage, followed by external radiotherapy about the perineum and the inguinal ganglia. Three months after the end of her treatment, the patient presented with a nodula on the left outer breast with features of malignancy noticed by clinic and mammographic examination. The histologic study of the mammary biopsy showed epidermoid carcinoma of likely metastatic origin. A left Patey has been realized and confirmed the metastatic localization of epidermoid carcinoma with axillary ganglial metastasis (2N+\/-7). Besides, this patient presented a right cervical ganglial parcel that the biopsy showed a metastatic localization of a vulvar carcinoma. A palliative chemotherapy type cyclophosphamid, adriblastin, cisplatine (CAP) has been admistrated during three cycles spaced out three weeks. The patient died 11 months after the supervene of the cerebral metastasis. We present this case because its rarety and to show the possibility of metastasis at the level of breast due to vulvar cancer. The clinicians must remember this possible tropism of the vulvar cancer for the breast, not only during the supervision and the complete examination as regards the disease spreading but also when the affection revealed unknown primary tumor. The diagnostic orientation is based on the mammography and the mammary biopsy. In this stage, the treatment is unfortunately palliative, the survival until a year is not more than 20%.","1679":"Nasopharyngeal angiofibroma is a locally aggressive, although histologically benign, vascular neoplasm. This neoplasm accounts for 0.05% of head and neck tumours and affects almost exclusively male adolescents. Surgery is considered as the primary treatment of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma. Other treatment modalities such as radiotherapy and chemotherapy are still recommended for intracranial extension involving the cavernous sinus or the internal carotid artery. We report a rare case of nasopharyngeal angiofibroma, further complicated with a Kennedy syndrome in a 34 year-old women. The treatment consisted in a chemotherapy (adriamycine, decarbazine) followed by radiotherapy. We discuss the relevance and outcome of the association chemotherapy-radiotherapy in the treatment of nasopharyngeal angiofibromas with a consistent intracranial extension (stage III B of Arch Otolaryngol Head Neck Surg 122 (2003) 122-129).","1680":"From the beginning of 2000, accelerated and partial breast irradiation (APBI) progressively acquired maturity and used more and more sophisticated technologies. At this time, at least six international phase III trials are ongoing. The statistical design of these studies is elaborated in order to show equivalence between APBI and whole breast irradiation (WBI) in term of local control. What and when we have to wait from these randomized trials? The presented analysis discusses not only the advantages and different interrogations concerning APBI, but also the difficulties for radiation oncologists and patients to assume the long period until the publication of the ongoing phase III trial results. APBI will find its place beside WBI, as well as conservative treatment founded its place beside radical mastectomy 30 years ago. However, clinical investigation conditions appear now different and this is this difference we have to manage rigorously and precisely.","1681":"Comparative study between a classical conformational prostate radiotherapy (3DRTC) and two arctherapy techniques, a coplanar (AT-C) and the other non-coplanar (AT-NC). The comparison has been made retrospectively on 30 patients with localized prostate cancer (T2-T3a, PSA&lt; 20 ng\/ml, Gleason&lt;7). The objective criteria for comparison were the NTCP, EUD, and dose volume (on DVH), for the volumes of bladder wall, rectal wall, femoral heads, small bowel, prostate (P) and seminal vesicles (VS). The treatment was 46Gy on PTV1 (VS+P+margins), and then an overdose of 30Gy on PTV1 (P+margins). For prostate volumes exceeding 75 cm(3), arctherapy leads to a decrease in uniformity in the target volume and an increase in the dose received by the femoral heads, this method does not seem appropriate. For prostate volumes less than 75 cm(3), in addition to the coverage almost tumor, and radiation toxicity equivalent to the bladder and the small intestine, there is a significant increase in the dose to the femoral heads, while the remaining is still within limits, such as clinically tolerable. The contribution of arctherapy is mainly observed at the level of rectal doses. The dose received by 30% of the rectum is reduced by -12% for AT-C and -11.7% for AT-NC, and EUD rectum -5.2% and -4.8%. In this virtual study, the arctherapy seems to generate a true dose reduction in the rectum wall. These results encourage us to continue the investigation for a possible integration in a dynamic clinical routine. ","1682":"Technical advancements in imaging, in radiation therapy (RT) planning and RT delivery, have facilitated the safe delivery of conformal radiation therapy to patients with unresectable hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). Although experience in liver cancer RT is limited, the RT technologies and tools to deliver RT safely are being disseminated rapidly. A variety of doses and RT fractionations have been used to treat HCC, and RT has been used in combination with other therapies including transarterial hepatic chemoembolization (TACE). Outcomes following RT alone or RT and TACE appear better than outcomes following similar historical controls of TACE alone, however, randomized trials of RT are needed. The first site of recurrence following RT is most often within the liver, away from the high dose volume, providing rationale for combining RT with regional or systemic therapies. Given the vascular properties of HCC, the combination of RT with anti-VEGF targeted agents may improve outcomes further.","1683":"","1684":"The Oxygen effect plays a key role in cellular response to ionizing radiations. From many years, tumour hypoxia is a limiting treatment factor. Multiple ways to interact with free radicals have been developed. The increase in tissue oxygenation has a limited impact. Radiosensitizing agents as nimorazole or gadolinium have a clinical benefit. Tirapazamine or AQ4N, bioreductive agents, are not routinely used. New agents through the HIF-1 and the endothelial cell pathways are currently being developed. Studies on the expression of endogenous markers of hypoxia could be useful tools to predict tumour response to the treatment.","1685":"Radiotherapy is an essential treatment for many patients with head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Its association with molecular targeted therapies represents a real progress. Among the recent advances in the molecular targeted therapy of cancer, the applications centred on EGFR are currently the most promising and the most advanced at clinical level. Considering the set of therapeutic tools targeting EGFR, there are at present two well-identified emerging categories of drugs with monoclonal antibodies, on the one hand, and tyrosine kinase inhibitors, on the other. In many preclinical studies, the combination of anti-EGFR drugs with irradiation has led to additive or supra-additive cytotoxic effects. Furthermore, antiangiogenic agents have shown promising results in association with anti-EGFR drugs and radiotherapy. This research effort has recently produced encouraging clinical results in advanced head and neck cancer with combination of cetuximab (an anti-EGFR monoclonal antibody) with irradiation with a significant impact on patient survival. Active and efficient clinical research is currently ongoing to determine the place of molecular targeted therapies in the treatment of head and neck cancer, particularly in association with radiotherapy.","1686":"Combined radiation and hormone therapies have become common clinical practice in recent years for locally-advanced prostate cancers. The use of such concomitant therapy in the treatment of breast disease has been infrequently reported in the literature, but seems justified given the common hormonal dependence of breast cancer and the potential synergistic effect of these two treatment modalities. As adjuvant therapy, two strategies are used in daily clinical practice: upfront aromatase inhibitors or sequentially after a variable delay of tamoxifen. These molecules may, thus, interact with radiotherapy. Retrospectives studies recently published did not show any differences in terms of locoregional recurrences between concurrent or sequential radiohormonotherapy. Lung and skin fibroses due to concurrent treatment are still under debate. Nevertheless, late side effects appeared to be increased by such a treatment, particularly in hypersensitive patients identified at risk by the lymphocyte predictive test. Concurrent radiohormonotherapy should, thus, be delivered cautiously at least for these patients. This article details the potent advantages and risks of concurrent use of adjuvant hormonotherapy and radiotherapy in localized breast cancers.","1687":"As the population become aged, many patients with hip prosthesis are treated for a pelvic cancer. The recommended ballistic must avoid to pass in the prosthesis, but sometimes it is inevitable. So it is essential to quantify with accuracy the dose modifications linked to the presence of metallic implant. The aim of this study is to analyze by Monte Carlo method these modifications in simple and complex models (anthropomorphic phantom) which take into account the geometry and the composition of the prosthesis and its coatings. Then, this methodology was used to study the behaviour of a treatment planning system in theses extreme conditions.","1688":"To describe therapeutic modalities for localized prostate cancer treated by conformal radiation to 76Gy with or without androgen ablation. To evaluate the preliminary results in terms of survival, biological control and toxicity. Between January 1998 and June 2001, 321 patients with localized prostate cancer were irradiated at institut Curie. Tumors were stratified into the three Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center prognostic groups (1998) for analysis: favorable risk group (FG) 23%, intermediate risk group (IG) 36.5%, unfavorable risk group (UG) 40.5%. Androgen deprivation, mainly neoadjuvant, less or equal to one year was prescribed to 93.8% of patients (72.6% less or equal to six months). Planning target volume prescription doses were: prostate: 76Gy, seminal vesicles: 56 to 76Gy, and pelvic lymph nodes: 44Gy to 16.8% of patients. The five-year actuarial overall survival was 94% (95% IC: 90-97%). The median post-therapeutic follow-up was 36 months (nine to 60 months). The 48-month actuarial rates of biochemical control for the three prognostic groups were statistically different according to both the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology consensus (ASTRO 1997) and the Fox Chase Cancer Center definitions of biochemical failure (FCCC 2000) with respectively 87 and 94% for FG, 78 and 84% for IG, 54 and 58% for UG (P&lt;10(-6) and P&lt;10(-8)). At time of our analysis, late post-treatment rectal and bladder bleedings were 17,4 and 13,6%, respectively. According to a 1-4 scale adapted from M.D. Anderson Cancer Center criteria: rectal bleedings were grade 1 (9.6%), grade 2 (6.2%) and grade 3 (1.6%). Bladder bleedings were grade 2 (13%) and grade 3 (0.6%). Analysis of rectal bleeding risk factors showed significant correlations with pelvic lymph nodes irradiation for grade 2 and 3, (P=0.02), and for all grades, a correlation with smaller rectal wall volumes (P=0.03), and greater percentages of rectal wall irradiated to higher doses: 65, 70, 72 and 75Gy (P=0.02, P=0.01, P=0.0007 and P=0.003, respectively). These results are comparable to those previously reported with the same follow-up. Impact of dose escalation with short androgen deprivation on local control, survival and complications needs longer follow-up and further analysis. ","1689":"Angiogenesis is a crucial requirement for tumorogenesis, providing oxygen and nutrient supply necessary for tumor growth and metastasis. This is a complex phenomenon regulated by many factors that can now be targeted by novel anti-cancer therapies. Antiangiogenic approaches have shown positive results in clinical trials and are now approved as standard of care in medical oncology. Many clinical trials are evaluating antiangiogenic agents in association with radiotherapy. This review aims to summarize the knowledge useful to the understanding of these novel therapies and their potential in combination with radiotherapy.","1690":"This study aims to evaluate local failure patterns in node negative breast cancer patients treated with post-mastectomy radiotherapy including internal mammary chain only. Retrospective analysis of 92 internal or central-breast node-negative tumours with mastectomy and external irradiation of the internal mammary chain at the dose of 50 Gy, from 1994 to 1998. Local recurrence rate was 5 % (five cases). Recurrence sites were the operative scare and chest wall. Factors associated with increased risk of local failure were age &lt; or = 40 years and tumour size greater than 20mm, without statistical significance. Post-mastectomy radiotherapy should be discussed for a sub-group of node-negative patients with predictors factors of local failure such as age &lt; or = 40 years and larger tumour size. ","1691":"Oxaliplatin is integrated in treatment strategies against a variety of cancers including chemoradiation protocols against gastrointestinal, especially rectal cancers. Solid biological data with respect to radiosensitizing activity of oxaliplatin are still rare. This review is based on in vitro and experimental in vivo data concerning the combination of oxaliplatin and radiation published until July 2007. Taking either cell viability or clonogenic survival as an endpoint all reported on oxaliplatin-induced radiosensitization, and enhancement ratios ranged from 1.1 to 2.2. In vivo, enhanced tumor growth delay after combined oxaliplatin and radiation treatment was also reported. Therefore, oxaliplatin should be considered a potent radiosensitizer, although the mechanisms causing radiosensitizing properties of oxaliplatin have not been studied in detail. Herein, they are discussed with respect to apoptosis induction, p53-related signalling, cell cycle control, and DNA-repair.","1692":"The present review represents an up-to-date focus on the particular topic of cervix carcinoma. An exhaustive description of the actual data and the near-future combination of radiotherapy and drugs with the specific potential of targeted therapies are presented. This approach represents one of the next challenges to improve results. Studies conducted in 1999, 2000, and 2002 reported the results of six large-scale prospective randomized trials using concomitant chemoradiation with a significant progression-free and overall survival rate improvement compared to radiotherapy only. These results were confirmed by the two last meta-analyses. Nowadays, the concurrent radiochemotherapy schedule used in the treatment of high risk cervical cancer is a standard practice. More growing evidences suggest that intracellular signal pathways play a significant role in radiation response. Several prognostic factors on tumoral radiosensitivity have been identified, including intracellular signal pathways, in the particular case of cervix carcinoma. Promising results have been obtained in experimental studies assessing the combined use of specific inhibitors and radiotherapy. Based on these data, a number of clinical trials have been started to enhance tumor responses and thus, to decrease the rate of recurrences.","1693":"At cellular level, signalization pathway activated by ErbB receptors participate to the proliferation, migration and differenciation of many cellular types. Observed alterations are mutations, overexpressions with or without gene amplification or abnormal stimulation by their ligands. The most frequently observed mutation is an extracellular deletion aiming to activate tyrosine kinase activity without ligand. Strategies to target the EGFr receptor include antisens oligonucleotids, antibodies directed to extracellular component of tyrosine kinase receptor. Only monoclonal antibodies and TKI have been developed in clinical research, mainly for oesophageal and rectal carcinomas. Solid tumor proliferation is under control of tumoral mechanisms and the interaction between tumor and microenvironment. In particular, angiogenesis is important during invasive and metastasis phases. The major role of Vasculoendothelial Growth Factor (VEGF) in angiogenesis is useful for tumor growth, which has been demonstrated by many convergent studies. Radiosensitivation or reversion of radioresistance could be obtained by inhibition of VEGF pathway. Antibodies directed against this molecule have been introduced in GI tract malignancies for the treatment of pancreatic and colic carcinomas.","1694":"","1695":"The surgical treatment of locally advanced prostate cancer has often been discouraged and in many cases a combined treatment with radiotherapy and hormone-therapy is proposed. Nevertheless, radical prostatectomy is efficient in mono-therapy in the majority of patients with a PSA lower than 20 microg\/l, a unilateral stage T3a and a Gleason score lower than 8. Patients with a more advanced local stage or with a less well differentiated tumour should not be excluded from a surgical treatment as an initial option. The majority of them will benefit from a multimodal treatment. This can consist of adjuvant radiotherapy in case of obvious margin positive disease, a salvage radiotherapy in case of PSA relapse during follow-up, or a hormonal treatment in case of PSA persistence after surgery or in cases of advanced lymph node invasion. The urologist must utilise the results of the definitive pathology and of the post-operative PSA levels in order to find the indications where and when additional treatment can be applied. The results obtained after 10-15 years with a radical prostatectomy, eventually combined with radiation or hormonal treatment are excellent concerning the cancer specific survival at long term. Therefore radiotherapy and hormones is not the treatment of choice for all clinical T3 prostate cancers.","1696":"Many predictive factors of tumor radiosensitivity have been described. Number of clonogenic cells, proliferation rate, hypoxia and intrinsic radiosensitivity are usually considered as the main parameters of tumor control. Intrinsic radiosensitivity is correlated in a first approach to the ability of the cell to detect and repair DNA damages, and so integrity of the different pathways involved in this function: PARP-1, XRCC1, ATM, p53, MRN complex or BRCA1... Genetic polymorphisms of some of these genes, found in normal lymphocytes, have been correlated to late toxicity of normal tissues. But, in tumors, because of the difficulty to obtain samplings and heterogeneity, accurate molecular analysis is not possible in many cases, and no valuable test of radiosensitivity exist at this moment. For example, TP53 gene has been evaluated in many studies and results regarding its potential as a predictive factor of tumor sensitivity are conflicting. Surviving fraction at 2Gy (SF2) allowed a global evaluation of sensitivity, but the obtention of this parameter often takes a long time and failed in 20 to 40%. Evaluation of double-strand break repair capacity by immunochemistry quantification of phosphorylated forms of ATM, H2AX or MRE11 is an interesting topic. However, discovery of tumor stem cells in a number of epithelial tumors could revolutionize the understanding of radiosensitivity. Combination of genomic and functional techniques are probably essential to better predict this parameter.","1697":"Tumours of the upper aerodigestive tract represent the sixth most frequent kind of cancer in France and throughout the world. If the localised forms may be controlled in the long run in two thirds of cases by surgery or radiotherapy, only one third of locally advanced forms are accessible to a cure after association from radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Besides, with a median of survival less than six months, metastatic tumours present a catastrophic spontaneous prognosis among patients with a medical ground that is often heavily deteriorated by prolonged exposure to alcohol and tobacco. Thus, there is a necessity to implement adapted therapeutic strategies to each patient and based on satisfactory proof levels of effectiveness. Optimisation of existing chemotherapy protocols and development of new therapies, in particular of targeted therapies, remain an important objective in the hope to improve results of treatments in locally advanced and metastatic cancers of the oral cavity.","1698":"","1699":"The contribution of induction chemotherapy (CT) followed by hyperfractionated radiotherapy (hfRT) in unresectable squamous head and neck cancer has been evaluated in a single institution as an assistencial protocol. From March 1994 to June 2000 all consecutive patients with unresectable disease were treated with four courses of platin plus fluorouracil based CT followed by hfRT. Tumor resectability and response was assessed by a multidisciplinary committee. Ninety-nine patients (pts) were treated. All of them had stage IV-M0 disease: 67 T4, 88 N2-N3. Tumor location: 62 oropharynx, 22 hypopharynx, eight oral cavity and seven larynx. Tumor response at the end of treatment: 61 patients complete response, 17 partial response, two stable disease, 10 progressive disease and nine unevaluated. With a median follow-up of 70 months the 5-year loco-regional control and overall survival was 30.3% (95% CI: 21.9-38.6) and 21.6% (95% CI: 13.4-29.8), respectively. Loco-regional control and overall survival is significantly influenced by prior response to induction CT. Main grade 3-4 toxicity related to CT was stomatitis, but there were five patients with an ischemic event. Grade 3-4 acute toxicity related to hfRT: 47 stomatitis, 20 epithelitis. Chronic toxicity related to hfRT: six emergency tracheotomies due to laryngeal edema, five pneumonia and one mucous\/soft-tissue necrosis. There were eight toxic related deaths. Induction CT followed by hfRT might increase the overall survival rate in unresectable disease. HfRT resulted in a high rate of acute toxicity and its use would not be warranted in those patients with no response to induction CT who had a low probability of long-term control. ","1700":"In 2006, 3 sites have been selected by the Institut national of cancer (Lille, Nancy et Nice) to evaluate a radiotherapy robot, the CyberKnife. This machine, able to track mobile tumours in real time, gives new possibilities in the field of extra cranial stereotactic radiotherapy. Functionalities and medico economical issues of the machine will be evaluated during 2 years on the 3 sites.","1701":"","1702":null,"1703":"To evaluate the outcome of patients treated for soft tissue sarcoma using three different post-operative radiotherapy schedules. Between 1990 and 2003, 89 patients (median age 50.8 years) presenting with soft tissue sarcoma (located to the limbs for 66 of them) underwent post-conservative-surgery radiotherapy. Pathology was liposarcoma in 35 cases and 54 others tumors. Tumors grades (FNCLCC classification) were 1, 2, 3 or unknown in 29, 32, 19 and 9 cases, respectively. Surgery was considered as complete in 68 patients. Irradiation was normofractionated (NF) in 62 cases, hyperfractionated (BF) in 19 cases and hypofractionated (HF) in 8 cases. For all the patients, median delivered dose was 61 Gy [34-76 Gy]. Median follow-up of alive patients was 73,8 months [3-184]. Five-year local control (LC) and overall survival (OS) rates were 85.5 and 71.2% respectively. According to multifactorial analysis, favourable prognostic factors were for local control, complete surgery (P=0.0075) and for overall survival, complete surgery (P=0.0267), grade 1 tumor (P=0.012) and absence of distant recurrence (P=0.0488). There was no statistical evidence of difference for the five-year LC and OS rates between the patients who received NF, BF or HF. There were few complications and there were comparable in the three groups. This retrospective serie showed similar results for all the schedules. There is no evidence to recommend bifractionation. Hypofractionation should be used only in selected patients with poor performans status. ","1704":"Whole breast irradiation delivering an equivalent dose of 50 Gy in 5 weeks, followed by a 10 to 16 Gy-boost to the tumor bed is the standard of care after breast-conserving surgery for early-breast cancer. Accelerated partial breast irradiation (APBI) is currently under investigations in large multi-institutional, prospective, randomized trials to objectively address the critical endpoints of treatment efficacy, toxicity and cosmesis. Patient's selection for this new approach is crucial to individualise treatments and define the subgroups of patients who will really benefit from APBI in terms of quality of life without decreasing long-term results of the disease control and cosmesis. In this review, we will discuss the patients' profiles selection for APBI regarding their general and tumor criteria. The differences between APBI techniques either performed intra or post operatively will be also discussed.","1705":null,"1706":null,"1707":"After a request for proposal initiated by National Institute against cancer (INCa) in 2005, three French centers in France started tomotherapy in the first semester of 2007. A national policy of evaluation was performed to study the feasibility of this innovative technique and to compare the interest of helicoidal tomotherapy with other modalities of conformal therapy. Common protocols have been designed to facilitate this evaluation. Description of dose, IMRT levels and constraints are achieved according to each selected indication as: sarcoma, head and neck tumors, lung cancer, mesothelioma, bone metastases, anal carcinoma and craniospinal irradiation.","1708":"Brachytherapy using I 125 permanent implants as monotherapy is a validated technique of treatment for localised prostate cancer with favorable prognostic factors, as external beam irradiation or surgery are. It necessitates a strict selection of the patients and a precise technique in a specialised unit. The narrow collaboration between radiation-oncologist, urologist en medical physicist is necessary along the successive steps of the selection, treatment, and follow-up of the treatment. The good carcinologic and functional 10 years results confirm the preliminary results. New indications of brachytherapy using other techniques and different combinations with external beam irradiation are investigated.","1709":null,"1710":null,"1711":"Gingival metastases are very rare. We report the case of a 47 year-old man presenting with a gingival metastasis from a non small cell lung carcinoma. According to the literature, the most probable way of spread of such metastasis is haematogenous. Local implantation of cancer cells, present in patient's expectorations, in a fragile gingiva may be an other pathway of lung cancer metastasizing in this region as we will try to describe in this case report. Cytological and\/or histological investigation is needed to assess the malignant and the metastatic character of these gingival lesions. A rapid regression is observed after a flash of external beam radiation; nevertheless metastasis prognosis depends on the primary tumour progress.","1712":"Local failure after radiotherapy can arise with cancer extending beyond the capsule and\/or involvement of seminal vesicles or positive surgical margins. After undergoing radical prostatectomy 1005 patients were randomly assigned (1999-2001) to a wait and see policy or an immediate postoperative irradiation (60 Gy delivered over 6 weeks); eligible patients had pN0 M0 tumors and one or more pathological risk factors mentioned above. The main end-point was 5-year biochemical progression free survival. After a median follow-up of 5-year biochemical progression free survival was significantly improved in the irradiated group (74%, 98% CI: 68.7-79.3 vs 52.6%, 98% CI: 46.6-58.5; P&lt;0.0001) Clinical progression free survival was also significantly improved (P&lt;0.0009). The cumulative rate of loco-regional failure was also significantly improved (P&lt;0.0009). Grade 2 or 3 late effects were significantly more frequent in the postoperative irradiation group (P=0.0005), but severe toxicity (grade 3 or higher) were rare with a 5-year rate of 2.6% in the wait-and-see group and 4.2% in the postoperative irradiation group (P=0.07). Immediate external irradiation after radical prostatectomy improves biochemical progression free survival and local control in patients with positive surgical margin or pT3 prostate cancer who are at high risk of progression. Further follow-up is needed to assess the impact on overall survival. ","1713":"Surgery alone is no longer appropriate to the treatment of T3-T4 resecable rectal cancer. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy has recently been approved as the new standard treatment. This approach improves local control with local failure rate raranging now around 6-8%. However, it does not impact on overall survival. It becomes urgent to develop new concepts and a basic research in the understanding of the biological mechanisms that may explain the resistance of the micrometastatic process.","1714":"Tomotherapy is a new external beam radiation therapy technique using helicoidal intensity modulated radiation principle. It is able to avoid multiple isocenters requested to irradiate large volumes. This machine integrates image acquisition, treatment planning, positioning of the patient and irradiation into a sole engine. Six degrees of freedom robot coupled with a 6 MV linear accelerator, InCA has installed the Cyberknife in France in 3 sites chosen. The last generation of linac is a multifunction machine able to deliver conformal irradiations with or without intensity modulated radiation therapy, cranial or extracranial stereotactic irradiation with or without arctherapy or modulation. Performances of each machine have to be measured and compared in a medical and economical procedure.","1715":"Recent advances in radiation oncology are based on improvement in dose distribution thanks to IMRT and improvement in target definition through new diagnostic imaging such as spectroscopic or functional MRI or PET. However, anatomic variations may occur during treatment decreasing the benefit of such optimization. Image-guided radiotherapy reduces geometric uncertainties occurring during treatment and therefore should reduce dose delivered to healthy tissues and enable dose escalation to enhance tumour control. However, IGRT experience is still limited, while a wide panel of IGRT modalities is available. A strong quality control is required for safety and proper evaluation of the clinical benefit of IGRT combined or not with IMRT.","1716":"The low incidence, the wide histological spectrum and the natural, sometimes slow, evolution of malignant parotid gland tumours do not allow to easily establish the impact of their treatments. At present, clinical data come from retrospective cohort analysis, whereas randomized phase II-III trials are confidential. Moreover conclusions from these studies are controversial. We present here the therapeutic highlights of parotid cancers: surgery, with the particular concern of facial nerve preservation; and adjuvant treatment essentially based on radiotherapy. This review focused on adjuvant care explores the indications and the technical aspects of radiation, as well as the role of concurrent chemotherapy.","1717":"Although radical prostatectomy is an effective treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer, it fails in up to 20 to 40% of the cases. Local failure represents one of the possible patterns of relapse and is announced by detectable serum PSA levels. Patients at high risk for local relapse have extraprostatic disease, positive surgical margins or seminal vesicles infiltration at pathology. Three recently published phase III randomized clinical trials have clearly shown that, for these patients, immediate adjuvant irradiation reduces the risk of progression. For patients undergoing postoperative irradiation the standardisation of the target volume definition and delineation is required because no general consensus exists on \"prostate bed\" definition. The Genito-Urinary Working Party of the Radiation Oncology Group of the European Organization for the Research and treatment of cancer (ROG-EORTC) has developed a set of Guidelines to assist radiotherapists in the contouring of target volumes for postoperative irradiation: a consensus has been reached on a set of recommendations that are proposed to the radiation oncologist community. Emphasis has been put on the optimal cooperation between the surgeon, the pathologist and the radiotherapist in the frame of a multidisciplinary approach. Data on the presence and on the localization of extraprostaic extension and on positive surgical margins must be used. Placement of metallic clips in the tumor bed is of great help in localizing fixed anatomical sites as the anastomosis. The goal of such a document is to reduce inter-observer variability in target delineation in the framework of future clinical trials.","1718":"After 3D conformal radiation therapy without and with modulated intensity, image-guided radiation therapy represents a new technological step. Should prostate cancer treatment using radiotherapy with the CyberKnife robotic system be considered as a new treatment and then investigated through classical clinical research procedure rather than a technical improvement of an already validated treatment? After a general presentation of the CyberKnife , the authors focused on prostate cancer treatment assuming that, according to dosimetric and biological considerations, the treatment by robotic system appears comparable to high dose rate brachytherapy. For prostate cancer treatment are discussed: biological rational for hypofractionated treatment, high dose rate brachytherapy boost and interest of dose escalation. A comparison is presented between CyberKnife and other validated treatment for prostate cancer (radical prostatectomy, 3D conformal radiation therapy and low and high dose rate brachytherapy). In summary, CyberKnife treatment could be considered as a technical improvement of an already validated treatment in order to deliver a prostate boost after pelvic or peri-prostatic area irradiation. However, the clinical, biological and economical results must be precisely analyzed and could be assessed in the frame of a National Observatory based on shared therapeutic program.","1719":"Within the frame of Plan cancer and events of radioprotection which occurred since 2005, the community of radiation oncologists is aware under the umbrella of SFRO of the technologic, structural and cultural mutation that our discipline is going through, with the support of the tutelages. We report on the actions the SFRO has participated with, or initiated these last 2 years.","1720":"Intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) is a new high precision radiotherapy technique, allowing to protect some normal tissues without compromising the tumour cure probability. This is a more complex and more costly technique, compared to conventional radiotherapy, which needs increased quality assurance programs. The early results obtained in head-and-neck carcinomas have been very promising but would need to be confirmed in randomised trials to determine whether these results can be transposed to the majority of these cancers and especially to locally advanced cases, which are the most frequently occurring forms of these cancers.","1721":null,"1722":"Salvage radiotherapy after radical prostatectomy can be delivered either in case of biochemical recurrence or in situation of clinical relapse. In this last case, results are poor regarding disease-free survival but quite interesting regarding the local control rate. The best situation for salvage radiotherapy is still the rising PSA case: half of the patients can be in complete remission at 5 years after 65 Gy radiotherapy. The role of hormone therapy combined with salvage radiotherapy is still under investigation.","1723":"We report the case of a 19-year-old young woman for whom was discovered a pregnancy at the end of the irradiation for a Hodgkin lymphoma (stage IV bone Bb), initially treated by chemotherapy. The radiotherapy delivered 36 Gy in infra-diaphragmatic volumes (lombo-aortic, spleen, L5), beginning in a pregnant patient for less than 4 amenorrhea weeks. The calculated received fetal dose (literature data, measurement with software TPS, measurement on phantom) is high: it's between 2.8 and 5 Gy. With a current follow-up of 4 years since the radiotherapy's end, the patient is in complete remission and her child presents with a normal development for the age, in spite of the infradiaphragmatic irradiation.","1724":"Extramedullary haematopoiesis is a physiologic response to chronic anaemia, commonly observed in various haematological disorders. This phenomenon is habitually asymptomatic but it may induce compression of adjacent organs such as the spinal cord. We present the cases of two patients suffering from chronic anaemia, who developed foci of ectopic hematopoiesis, and we discuss through a review of literature, the presentation and the management of this disease, with focus on the role of decompressive radiotherapy.","1725":"To determine the level and prognostic significance of c-kit expression in the two age groups of North African nasopharyngeal carcinomas. A retrospective study of 99 NPC specimens from Tunisian patients was investigated by immunohistochemistry. Immunohistochemical data were correlated with Epstein-Barr virus LMP1 expression and pathological, clinical and survival parameters. c-kit was detected in 79% of the cases for patients under 30 years of age (juvenile form) but in only 56% of specimens in patients over 30 years (P=0.039) and was significantly over-expressed for patients with lymph node involvement (P=0.015). LMP1 score was 5.78 (+\/-1.84) for c-kit negative tumors compared to 8,23 (+\/-2.39) for c-kit positive tumors (P=0.002). Multivariate analysis including age, lymph nodes involvement and LMP1 expression as co-variables, showed that only age (P=0.027) and LMP1 expression (P=0.005) were significantly correlated to the c-kit expression. c-kit is highly expressed in the juvenile form of North African nasopharyngeal carcinomas. There is a significant association between LMP1 and c-kit expression. The contrasted levels of C-kit expression in the two age groups strengthen the hypothesis that these clinical forms result from distinct oncogenic mechanisms. ","1726":"The current retrospective study aimed to identify some determinants of survival in metastatic NPC. The study concerned 95 patients with metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma treated between 1993 and 2001. Statistical comparison between patients subgroups survival was carried out employing the log-Rank test (statistical significance was defined as p&lt;or=0.05). Multivariable analysis was performed using the Cox model (p&lt;or=0.05 was used as the cut-off value of statistical significance). Factors that were considered included: age group(&lt;or=45 years or&gt;45 years and&lt;or=25 years or&gt;25 years), gender, performance status at diagnosis of metastatic disease (PS 0-1 or 2-3), time of metastasis diagnosis(at presentation or later), number of metastatic sites (single or multiple), specific metastatic sites(bone, liver, lung, distant nodes), number of bone metastasis (single or multiple), disease free survival (DFI) (&lt;or= or &gt;6 months), prior chemotherapy, radiotherapy of metastatic sites. Negative prognostic factors in univariate analysis were: poor PS (&gt;or=1), multiple metastatic sites, multiple bone metastasis, previous chemotherapy, visceral or node metastasis and non irradiated metastasis. Poor PS, multiple metastatic sites, and prior chemotherapy were independently significant negative prognostic factors in multivariable analysis. In this study we identified new prognostic factors in univariate and multivariate analysis. A regular and careful follow-up of patients treated for NPC is then recommended in order to detect early metastatic dissemination (with minimal localizations) while patients have still a good PS. ","1727":"Radiobiologists have pointed out a novel radiobiological phenomenon observed in many tumor and normal cell lines: hyper-radiosensitivity to very low-dose (HRS) followed by induced radioresistance (IRR) after a threshold dose of 0.1-0.3 Gy that depends on the cell line. Radioresistance at high dose (i.e. higher than 0.5 Gy) and metastatic potential of tumor cells are likely major factors of failure in radiotherapy. A careful review of literature suggests that: 1) radiotherapy does not increase the metastatic potential of tumor cells; 2) radioresistance at high dose and metastatic potential are not related. However, inside a given tumor cell line, highly metastatic clones may elicit more cells showing HRS or are more radiosensitive at high dose than poorly metastatic ones. Recent data obtained from molecular techniques (comet and immunofluorescence assays) applied to single cells irradiated at very low radiation doses (1-100 mGy) suggest that DNA single-strand breaks (SSB) and double-strand breaks (DSB) may be the key-lesions responsible for the HRS phenomenon. These data suggest that the HRS phenomenon may find application in radiotherapy for micrometastasis. These early disseminated and probably unvascularised cells may escape the influence of high-dose chemotherapy after excision of the primary tumor. Considering the link between metastatic potential and HRS, we have previously proposed to apply very low-dose total body irradiation (TBI) at M(0) stage that may prevent the development of micrometastases. Literature data suggest that the smallest radiation dose that can produce HRS without increasing the risk of cancer may be in the milliGrays range.","1728":"Epithelioid sarcoma is a rare type of soft tissue sarcomas with a high risk of recurrence both local and distant. The place of surgical conservative treatment and the role of radiation therapy remain controversial. A serie of 9 consecutive patients treated with initial conservative surgery and postoperative radiotherapy (median dose of 52.8 Gy) from 1987 to 2006 in the same institution was analyzed. With a median follow-up of 40 months (range 15-153 months), the rate of local, nodal and distant relapse is respectively 56%, 11% and 33%. The rate of death is 44.5%. No imputation has been performed. Even with a high rate of local relapse observed, a conservative treatment doesn't seem to influence badly the overall survival (55.5% alive at 40 months). Indeed the rate of distant relapse and death are comparable with those found in the literature. Moreover relapse occurred almost within the irradiated volumes. An improvement of dose could be also discussed. ","1729":"Trastuzumab (Herceptin) is the first humanised monoclonal antibody targeting the HER2 antigen in breast cancer. HER2 receptor has been individualised 20 years ago. During the past 10 years, trastuzumab administration has radically modified the prognosis of the patients that are treated for HER2 positive breast cancer. Its efficacy has been demonstrated in the metastatic and adjuvant settings. While, trastuzumab based-regimens became the standard of care in the treatment of HER2\/neu positive breast cancer, the optimal combination (concurrently or sequentially) to chemotherapy and radiation therapy is still unknown. Indeed, while the concurrent administration of trastuzumab and anthracyclines is not recommended because of a high risk of cardiac toxicity, there is no published data on the best sequence of trastuzumab and radiation therapy administration, particularly when internal mammary chain is involved. The benefit\/risk ratio of the concurrent and sequential administration of trastuzumab with chemotherapy and radiation therapy will be discussed in this review.","1730":"To study the clinical, radiological, therapeutic and progressive aspects of brain radionecrosis after treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Nine patients (seven men and two women) of mean age 47.7 years old (extremes: 18-57 years old) were treated for UCNT (undifferentiated carcinoma of the nasopharynx) between 1989 and 2003 and developed cerebral radionecrosis. All patients were treated with radical radiotherapy. The mean total dose was 73.5 Gy (70-75 Gy). Dose per fraction was 2 to 2.5 Gy, one fraction daily. One patient received adjuvant brachytherapy to the dose of 8 Gy and four patients also received chemotherapy. Brain radionecrosis was authenticated by brain imaging (CT scan+\/-MRI): the imaging was ordered in seven cases to elucidate non-specific neurological signs and two cases were discovered fortuitously. The time to the appearance of neurological signs was 40.3 months (10 to 108 months). The localization was temporal in six cases, parieto-occipital (one case) and bulbomedullar (two cases). After a mean follow-up period of 30.6 months (12-84 months), clinical outcomes were favorable in all cases receiving medical treatment (corticoids), with a stabilization of the radiological lesions in eight cases and complete radiological regression in one patient. Brain radionecrosis is a late complication rarely occurring in patients irradiated for UCNT. Imaging techniques (CT scan but more so MRI) play a major role in the diagnosis. Corticotherapy resulted in a durable objective response in all patients and, in most cases, resulted in radiological stabilization. ","1731":"A paratesticular pleomorphic rhabdomyosarcoma occurring in a 63-year old man is reported. Clinical signs were like any intrascrotal tumor. CT-scan and histological examination with immunohistochemical study were necessary for the diagnosis and stadification of this cancer. The patient underwent a radical inguinal orchidectomy. The patient developed a local recurrence, which was treated by radiotherapy, and subsequently developed metastases two years later, which were treated by chemotherapy.","1732":"To discuss, through a retrospective study, the epidemiologic and anatomo-clinic aspects of paediatric Hodgkin disease (HD) in south Tunisia and to study the faisability of the French protocol MDH 90 for our patients. Between January 1995 and December 2000, we treated 23 children with HD. Initial work-up included clinical examination, radiological explorations (chest X ray, abdomen ultrasonography and computed tomography scan of chest, abdomen and pelvis), biological explorations (full blood count, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, serum albumin, liver functions tests) and a bone marrow biopsy. Treatment was inspired from the SFOP MDH 90 protocol. Overall survivals and disease free survivals were estimated with Kaplan-Meier method and compared with the log-rank test. Mean age was 8.6 years (4-14 years), sex-ratio was 3.6. Histological subtypes 2 and 3 had the same frequency. Localised stages (I-II) were as frequent as advanced stages (III-IV). At the end of the treatment, the 18 evaluables patients were in complete remission. The 5-year overall survival (OS) and disease free survival (DFS) were 82 and 76% respectively. Localised stages and advanced stages had the same 5-year overall survival (82%). There were no statistical differences in term of OS between the different prognosis factors studied. The particularity of our study was the identical frequency of the two histological subtypes 2 and 3 and of localised and advanced stages. The MDH 90 protocol is feasable for our patients with satisfactory results similar to those found in the literature. ","1733":"Metastatic tumors in the breast are quite rare and constitute 0.5 to 6% of all breast malignancies. They often occur in a polymetastatic context. The most frequent primitive tumors are lymphoma, leukaemia and malignant melanoma. The gastric origin is seldom reported. We report here the observation of a 40-years woman operated in urgency for an acute abdominal syndrome. A gastric tumor was discovered intraoperatively with ovarian metastasis and peritoneal carcinosis. The pathological examination revealed a gastric signet ring cell carcinoma with an infiltration of the right ovary. Four months later, the patient presented with a lump of the right breast. The histologic examination corresponded to a mammary metastasis by a signet ring cell carcinoma from stomach. The objective of our work is to discuss through this observation the anatomoclinical and evolutionary characteristics of breast metastasis.","1734":null,"1735":"To evaluate two dosimetric supports used in pulse dose rate brachytherapy (PDR): coverage of target volumes, dose to organs at risk, residual tumor after surgery, survival. Twenty patients treated for uterine cervix tumor first by brachytherapy PDR had a dosimetric CT-scan after implantation. For 9 patients, the treatment was planned from standard radiographies and then reported on CT-scan images. For 11 patients, it was directly planned from CT-scan. Six weeks after, 18 patients underwent surgery. With a median follow-up of 22 months, 2 year actuarial survival was 89%. Six patients developed grade II urinary or gynecological complications (LENT SOMA scale). No residual tumor was found for 12 patients (7 with a 3D treatment and 5 a 2 D treatment). Ninety-five percent of CTVHR received 53 Gy (2D treatment) or 63 Gy (3D treatment). Two cm3 of bladder wall received 63 Gy (2D) or 74 Gy (3D) although 2 cm3 of rectal wall received 37 Gy (2D) and 35 Gy (3D). Using CT-scan made us improve the coverage of the uterine cervix but increase the dose received by the bladder, without increasing the rate of histological remission after surgery. We should be prudent before changing our practice. ","1736":"The use of heavy particles in the treatment of cancer is increasing remarkably, whether with external radiation or using a vector such as an antibody in radioimmunotherapy. Recent pre-clinical and clinical developments of alpha-radioimmunotherapy have provided more interesting information in parallel of the use of high Linear Energy Transfer (LET) external irradiation. This review aims at presenting recent advances of this therapeutic approach, and at detailing the biological specificities of this kind of radiation.","1737":"Respiration-gated radiotherapy offers a significant potential for improvement in the irradiation of tumor sites affected by respiratory motion such as lung, breast and liver tumors. An increased conformality of irradiation fields leading to decreased complications rates of organs at risk (lung, heart...) is expected. Respiratory gating is in line with the need for improved precision required by radiotherapy techniques such as 3D conformal radiotherapy or intensity modulated radiotherapy. Reduction of respiratory motion can be achieved by using either breath-hold techniques or respiration synchronized gating techniques. Breath-hold techniques can be achieved with active techniques, in which airflow of the patient is temporarily blocked by a valve, or passive techniques, in which the patient voluntarily holds his\/her breath. Synchronized gating techniques use external devices to predict the phase of the respiration cycle while the patient breaths freely. This work summarizes the different experiences of the centers of the STIC 2003 project. It describes the different techniques, gives an overview of the literature and proposes a practice based on our experience.","1738":"","1739":null,"1740":"Virtual simulation process is often used to prepare three dimensional conformal radiation therapy treatments. As the quality of the treatment is widely dependent on this step, it is mandatory to perform extensive controls on this software before clinical use. The tests presented in this work have been carried out on the treatment planning system ISOgray (DOSIsoft), including the delineation module IMAgo and the virtual simulation module SIMAgo. According to our experience, the most relevant controls of international protocols have been selected. These tests mainly focused on measuring and delineation tools, virtual simulation functionalities, and have been performed with three phantoms: the Quasar Multi-Purpose Body Phantom, the Quasar MLC Beam Geometry Phantom (Modus Medical Devices Inc.) and a phantom developed at Hospital Tenon. No major issues have been identified while performing the tests. These controls have emphasized the necessity for the user to consider with a critical eye the results displayed by a virtual simulation software. The contrast of visualisation, the slice thickness, the calculation and display mode of 3D structures used by the software are many factors of uncertainties. A virtual simulation software quality assurance procedure has been written and applied on a set of CT images. Similar tests have to be performed periodically and at minimum at each change of major version.

From 1976 to 2005, 286 patients (pts) were treated by exclusive radiotherapy (180 pts) or chemo-radiotherapy (106 pts) followed by a brachytherapy boost (233 pts) or external beam radiotherapy boost (24 pts). Forty-three pts were stage I, 154 stage II, 31 stage IIIA and 53 stage IIIB. The mean follow-up was 65 months (range: 1.3-250 months). The 5-years-overall survival and SS rates were 66.4% and 78.1% respectively. In multivariate analysis, tumor size (&gt;or=40 mm) [RR=2.1], node involvement (RR=2.4), and poor response (&lt;75%) to first course irradiation [RR=1.9], local relapse (RR=4.5) and distant metastases were factors of poor prognosis for SS. Five-years-LRC were 71.5% (88% for stage I, 69% for stage II, 77%, for stage IIIA and 60% for stage IIIB). Prognosis factors of LCR were tumor size (RR=2.5), response to first course of irradiation (RR=2.9). SC was 71% at 5 years. Prognosis factors of SC were tumor size (RR=1.9) and response to first course of irradiation (RR=2.4). The results of this series are similar to those of the literature. As well as initial tumor extension, response to first course of irradiation was found as prognostic factor on LCR, SS, SC. Our results are similar to other series and brachytherapy seems not to be deleterious. Its impact to local control remains to be evaluated. ","1743":"The goal of this study was to show the feasibility of step and shoot intensity-modulated radiation therapy pre-treatment quality control for patients using the electronic portal imaging device (iViewGT) fitted on a Sli+ linac (Elekta Oncology Systems, Crawley, UK) instead of radiographic films. Since the beginning of intensity-modulated radiation therapy treatments, the dosimetric quality control necessary before treating each new patient has been a time-consuming and therefore costly obligation. In order to fully develop this technique, it seems absolutely essential to reduce the cost of these controls, especially the linac time. Up to now, verification of the relative dosimetry field by field has been achieved by acquiring radiographic films in the isocenter plane and comparing them to the results of the XiO planning system (Computerized Medical Systems, Missouri, USA) using RIT113 v4.1 software (Radiological Imaging Technology, Colorado, USA). A qualitative and quantitative evaluation was realised for every field of every patient. A quick and simple procedure was put into place to be able to make the same verifications using portal images. This new technique is not a modification of the overall methodology of analysis. The results achieved by comparing the measurement with the electronic portal imaging device and the calculation with the treatment planning system were in line with those achieved with the films for all indicators we studied (isodoses, horizontal and vertical dose profiles and gamma index).","1744":"","1745":"Among the large spectrum of DNA damage induced by radiation, DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) are considered, to date, as the key-lesions responsible for the cell killing. However, although it was always intuitive to radiobiologists, such a conclusion has only been reached after technical developments and conceptual advances and remains consensual rather than demonstrated formally. In this article, we have reviewed the results that have lead to the conclusion that the assessment of successful DSB repair can be the basis of reliable assays predictive of the clinical response to radiotherapy and some chemotherapeutic treatments. We have discussed a number of technical artifacts, the biases due to the extrapolation of data obtained in yeast and rodent model systems to the human situation and the variety of phenotypes observed in human cells and in particular: 1) the most recent techniques developed, based on immunofluorescence, which have revolutionized our understanding of the molecular events occurring early after irradiation but have also raised the crucial questions about the choice of techniques to assess DSB repair and their specificity for different steps of the repair process; 2) While the homologous recombination repair pathway is predominant in yeasts, its importance in human cells appears less obvious, and raises the problem that the existence of randomized repair events may produce many more errors in human cells than in small genome organisms; 3) the impairment of DSB repair is observed in a plethora of genetic diseases, leading to radiosensitivity, immunodeficiency and sometimes cancer-proneness, but the low frequency and the pleiotropism of such diseases makes difficult the development of a single predictive assay. Therefore, although complete DSB repair appears to be crucial for cell survival, further research is still needed to provide innovative techniques fro measuring repair which can be successfully transferred to the clinic and used to ensure the avoidance of deleterious side-effects to cancer therapies.","1746":"Nasopharyngeal cancer is the commonest head and neck cancer in Tunisia treated with radiotherapy. A dose effect relationship is established in this tumor. The aim of this study is to describe our Low-dose-rate endocavitary brachytherapy using a personalized mold called Tunis applicator. Seven patients (4 males and 3 females) with histologically confirmed undifferentiated nasopharyngeal carcinoma (UCNT) were treated between 2002 and 2005. Five patients with primary cancer and 2 with recurrent disease received external beam radiation followed by endocavitary brachytherapy. The mean applied dose of endocavitary brachytherapy was 5.5 Gy for primary site after external beam radiation (70-74 Gy) and 30 Gy for recurrent disease after external beam radiation (38 Gy). We have developed a personalized applicator with a balloon to optimize the placement of sources and a better conformity using the computer tomography scanning. Critical normal structures were identified on orthogonal radiographs and the dose was optimized to avoid excessive doses to these structures. With a follow up of 18 months (8-41), only one local failure was observed, 3 years after external beam radiation therapy for a recurrent disease. Moderate grade mucositis was seen in most patients. One patient was diagnosed with bulb necrosis. Endobrachytherapy can provide effective treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma with an easy application of the brachytherapy procedure. ","1747":"Radiotherapy of lung cancer is often complexe because of several organs at risk such as lung, heart, esophagus or spinal cord. An accurate balance needs to be defined between the necessities to reach a local control and to limit the risks of toxicities for each of them. Several parameters were significantly correlated with radiation induced lung toxicities (V13, V20, 30, Mean Dose) and esophagitis (V40 to V60). However no parameters are clearly defined for heart toxicities. The large number of parameters described for lung and esophagus highlights the necessity to perform an overall analysis of the DVHs that could be possible by using Nomal Tissue Complication Probability models.","1748":"The authors report the results of the Patterns of Care for Brachytherapy in Europe (PCBE) throughout France. Responses were obtained for 91% of the Radiation Oncology departments, which have declared using brachytherapy for 67, and gave detailed data for 49 ones. The equipments and treated tumours were recorded. LDR brachytherapy remained the most often used (53.5%), followed by HDR (28%). PDR represented 5.5% and permanent implants 11%. The authors discuss the development of new equipment, with an aggregation of the structures, and an increase of the PDR and prostate implants use.","1749":"The head and neck tumors are most often associated with a precarious nutritional status. Radiotherapy increases the risk of denutrition because of its secondary effects on the secretory and sensorial mucous membranes. The purpose of our retrospectively study was to evaluate the interest of a precocious and regular nutritional therapy on the ability to maintain the nutritional status of the patient during the radiotherapy. The fifty-two patients included in the survey have been classified retrospectively in two different groups based on their observance to the nutritional therapy: group 1 \"good observance\", group 2 \"bad observance\". The 31 patients of group 1 have lost an average of 1.9 kg by the end of the irradiation, whereas the 21 patients of group 2 have lost an average of 6.1 kg (p&lt;0.001). The almost stability in weight of patients in group 1 was linked to a lower frequency of breaks in the radiotherapy (6 vs 33% p=0.03) and in a decrease in grade of inflammatory mucous membranes (10% of grade 3 in group 1 vs 52% in group 2, p=0.006). The quantity of calories ingested in form of nutritional supplements was greater in group 1 and consequently enabled patients to stabilized their weight (1200 calories in group 1 versus 850 calories in group 2, p&lt;0.005). The given nutritional advice and the prescription of adapted nutritional supplements consequently allowed limiting efficiently the weight lost during the irradiation and the grade of mucositis. The systematization of a precocious nutritional therapy for patients irradiated for head and neck tumors seems absolutely essential. ","1750":"Chemoradiation is one of the major therapeutic options in thoracic oncology: besides surgery, the best treatment for early-stage tumors, and chemotherapy, not only used in metastatic tumors, but also in a neoadjuvant and adjuvant setting, chemoradiation is the standard strategy for unresectable locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. Its current modalities include three-dimensional conformal techniques, allowing dose escalation and sequential and concurrent combination with new generation cytotoxic agents to occur. Phase III trials are currently evaluating the benefit from induction and consolidation chemotherapy in this setting. New techniques of radiation may also increase the efficacy and the feasibility of radiation. This constant progress makes chemoradiation one of the most promising combined treatments in thoracic oncology.","1751":"Superior sulcus tumors have been individualized among other non-small cell lung cancers because of their characteristic clinical presentation in connection with their local extension to the chest wall and the brachial plexus. For a long time considered as marginally resectable, superior sulcus tumors have been treated since the early 1960's, with a combined approach including preoperative radiotherapy and curative-intent surgery. Surgical resection includes both thoracic, cervical and neurosurgical approach, and aims at obtaining complete resection, which has been identified as a determining prognostic factor in most reported series. Two recent phase II trials showed the benefit, both regarding resectability and local control rates, and survival of combined therapeutic strategies including induction platinum-based chemoradiation, extensive surgical resection, and adjuvant chemotherapy. Adjuvant radiotherapy is not recommended at the time, but needs to be re-evaluated regarding its recent technical optimisation. Similarly to other locally advanced non-small cell lung cancers, exclusive chemoradiation is the standard treatment of unresectable superior sulcus tumors. In this way, radiotherapy has shown to offer a prolonged analgesia in more than 75% of cases, and is associated with concurrent or sequential chemotherapy, with comparable results to those observed in stage III lung cancer. These developments make superior sulcus tumors a therapeutic model for locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, whereby the benefit of combined multimodal strategies including induction chemoradiation and surgical resection are currently evaluated in phase III trials.","1752":"","1753":null,"1754":"Stereotactic body radiation therapy (SBRT) is a new treatment modality for early-stage non-small-cell lung cancer, and has been developed in the United States, the European Union, and Japan. We started a feasibility study of this therapy in July 1998, using a stereotactic body frame. The eligibility criteria for primary lung cancer were: 1) solitary tumor less than 4 cm (T1-3N0M); 2) inoperable, or the patient refused operation; 3) no necessity for oxygen support; 4) performance status equal to or less than 2; 5) the peripheral tumor which dose constraints of mediastinal organs are maintained. A total dose of 48 Gy was delivered in four fractions in 2 weeks in most patients. Lung toxicity was minimal. No grade II toxicities for spinal cord, bronchus, pulmonary artery, or esophagus were observed. The 3 years overall survival for 32 patients with stage IA, and 13 patients with stage IB were 83% and 72%, respectively. Only one local recurrence was observed in a follow-up of 6-71 months. We retrospectively analyzed 241 patients from 13 Japanese institutions. The local recurrence rate was 20% when the biological equivalent dose (BED) was less than 100 Gy, and 6.5% when the BED was over 100 Gy. Overall survival at 3 years was 42% when the BED was less than 100 Gy, and 46% when it was over l00 Gy. In tumors, which received a BED of more than 100 Gy, overall survival at 3 years was 91% for operable patients, and 50% for inoperable patients. Long-term results, in terms of local control, regional recurrence, survival, and complications, are not yet evaluated. However, this treatment modality is highly expected to be a standard treatment for inoperable patients, and it may be an alternative to lobectomy for operative patients. A prospective trial, which is now ongoing, will, answer these questions.","1755":"Choanal stenosis is usually a congenital anomaly in children. Acquired choanal stenosis after radiotherapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma is a very rare pathology; only two publications report seven cases in the literature. We describe the clinical history, preoperative evaluation, surgical treatment and outcome of a case of acquired choanal stenosis after radiotherapy. The patient, a 56-year-old woman, presented with a history of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (T2- NO-MO) one year before that had been successful treated with radiotherapy (68 Gy). At the end of radiotherapy, she complained of complete nasal obstruction, anosmia and hearing loss due to a bilateral serous otitis media. Bilateral complete choanal stenosis was confirmed by endoscopy and CT scan. Functional endoscopic surgery was performed, and nasal stents were left in place for 3 weeks. One year after, the patient have good airflow, and a patent nasopharynx without choanal stenosis. In conclusion, choanal stenosis is an unusual complication of radiotherapy that can be successfully treated with transnasal endoscopic resection.","1756":"The objective of this retrospective study was to discuss the epidemioclinical criteria, the therapeutic results and the prognostic factors of breast cancer in young women throughout a comparative study of 72 young patients aged less than 35 years and a second group of older premenopausal patients aged between 36 and 50 years. We reviewed the epidemioclinical records of all the patients. Non-metastatic and operable patients were treated with surgery (conservative or radical) followed by an adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy, radiotherapy, endocrine therapy) indicated according to the prognostic factors. Locally advanced or metastatic tumors were treated with chemotherapy. Overall survival was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. The comparison of survival curves was performed according to log-rank test. The multivariate analysis was performed according to the Cox model. The mean age was of 31.5 years. T2N1, node positive (N+), high grade (SBRII and III) and endocrine non-responsive tumors were the most frequent. There was no difference with the second group of older patients regarding the risk factors and the clinical criteria but mammography was more sensitive in the second group. The 5 years overall survival of young patients was of 57% and pejorative prognostic factors in univariate analysis were: tumor size, N+ and endocrine non-responsiveness. There were not any significant prognostic factors at the multivariate analysis. Young age less than 35 years was not a prognostic factor influencing overall survival in the totality of patients or in the different sub-groups according to the other prognostic factors. Clinical presentation and outcome of breast cancer in our young patients aged under 35 years seems not to be different from that in older patients. The conclusions of the different authors are controversial but the majority has reported more advanced tumors with worse prognostic than those of older patients.

Histological examination of laparoscopic liver biopsy specimens confirmed diffuse large-cell non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The disease was confined to the liver without any evidence of extrahepatic involvement. The serology of Epstein Barr virus was highly positive. PET-scan show increased FDG uptake at the site of hepatic lesion and the mediastin. The patient received chemotherapy followed by radiation therapy of the left liver at the dose of 31 Gy. The patient was alive and free of disease 20 months after the diagnosis of primary liver lymphoma. The primary hepatic lymphoma is a rare malignancy, which classically affects 50-year-old patients with a male preponderance. The incidence is increased in immunosuppressed patients and some authors have suggested an association with hepatitis B or C infection, and with the Epstein Barr virus.

The rigorous definition of the target volume and the organs at risk required by these irradiation techniques, imposed the development of various image guided patient positioning and target tracking techniques. The availability of these imaging systems inside the treatment room has lead to the exploration of performing real-time adaptive radiation therapy. In this paper we present the different image guided radiotherapy (IGRT) techniques and the adaptive radiotherapy (ART) approaches. IGRT developments are focused in the following areas: 1) biological imaging for better definition of tumor volume; 2) 4D imaging for modeling the intra-fraction organ motion; 3) on-board imaging system or imaging devices registered to the treatment machines for inter-fraction patient localization; and 4) treatment planning and delivery schemes incorporating the information derived from the new imaging techniques. As this paper is included in the \"Cancer-Radiotherapie\" special volume dedicated to the lung cancers, in the description of the different IGRT techniques we try to present the lung tumors applications when this is possible.","1760":"There have been main changes in the methods for the work-up of lung cancer over the last 15 years.

Between November 1990 and January 2002, 60 patients (pts) were treated with radiation therapy and concomitant chemotherapy. The T-stage according to the 2001 UICC classification were: 2 T1, 26 T2, 25 T3, and 7 T4. There were 20 pts with nodal involvement at presentation. The treatment started with external beam RT (median dose: 45 Gy) and concomitant chemotherapy using 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin during the first week and the fifth week of external beam RT (EBRT). After a rest period of 4 to 6 weeks, a boost of 20 Gy was delivered by EBRT in 58 pts and by interstitial (192)Ir brachytherapy in 2 pts. Mean follow-up were 78.5 months. At the end of RT with concomitant chemotherapy local tumor clinical complete response rate was 83%. Out of 10 non responders or local progression, 5 (50%) were salvaged with abdominoperineal resection (APR). Out of 5 local tumor relapses, 3 were salvaged with APR. The overall local tumor control (LC) rate with or without salvage local treatment were 88%. LC rate with a good anal function scoring (score 0 and 1) was 70%. Among 43 pts who preserved their anus, 98% had a good anal function scoring. The 5-year disease-free survival was 75%. After multivariate analysis, 2 independent predicting factors significantly influenced the disease-free survival: HIV-positive pts (negative vs positive, P=0.032) and clinical tumor response after the first course of radiotherapy (&lt;50% vs &gt;or=50%, P=0.00032). Acute grade 2 or 3 toxicities were low: haematological toxicity in 4 pts and intestinal complication corresponding to diarrhea in 10 pts. Late severe complication was observed in 3 pts: 2 pts with painful necrosis of the anus requiring colostomy and 1 pt with grade 3 rectal bleeding. We confirm the good results with RT and concomitant chemotherapy. The clinical tumor response after the first course of RT and concomitant chemotherapy is probably the most important predictive factor on the disease-free survival. For patients with T3 or T4 lesion and tumor regression &lt;or=50% after the first course of radiation therapy, surgical non conservative treatment should be discussed. ","1762":null,"1763":"Targeted therapies are now more often used in lung cancer. Inhibitors of EGFR and of angiogenesis have demonstrated a certain activity in this disease. Some experimental in vitro or in vivo studies are in favour of combined targeted therapies and radiation. For example, additive or supra-additive effects have been shown when inhibitors of the EGFR tyrosine kinase were given with radiation. In advanced lung cancer, the combination of bevacizumab with chemotherapy was demonstrated to produce better survival outcomes. But a high rate of fatal hemoptysis was reported with this drug, particularly for central and squamous tumors. This could be a limitation for its use in combination with radiation. Drugs with multiple targets are becoming available; their association with radiation seems to be promising.","1764":"Brain metastases are an important cause of mortality and morbidity. The prognosis is poor with a median survival of less than one year in the majority of cases. From this review, whole-brain irradiation clearly appears as the standard treatment.

Previous studies have clearly demonstrated the feasibility both regarding toxicities and resectability rates of the sequential and concurrent combination of radiation to chemotherapy in a neoadjuvant setting. However, induction chemoradiation has never been randomly compared to exclusive preoperative chemotherapy. Besides, the doses of radiation and the optimal drug combination remain undetermined at the time. Regarding the global therapeutic strategy of stage III non-small cell lung cancer, recently reported phase III trials evaluating the role of surgical resection after induction chemotherapy or chemoradiation, all showed the prognostic importance of the tumoral and mediastinal downstaging to select patients really benefiting from surgery. These developments make of the treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer a model for multimodal therapeutic strategies combining chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery.","1767":"Neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy is the gold standard of the treatment of advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. The role of surgery after chemoradiotherapy is still debated. Feasibility of curative resection depends on dose of radiotherapy, morbimortality rates, and nutrition status at the end of the protocol especially for non-responders patients. Adding surgery to radiochemotherapy improves local tumour control but does not increase overall survival of patients with advanced oesophageal squamous cell carcinoma. According to the two randomised trials published on the subject, surgery is not recommended after chemoradiotherapy for responders. Recommendations of French National Thesaurus are: exclusive chemoradiotherapy as reference, esophagectomy for residual tumour as alternative for operable patients. Surgery may be proposed for selected non-responders patients and some complete pathology response in expert center.","1768":"Decrease treatment uncertainties is one of the most important challenge in radiation oncology. Numerous techniques are available to quantify prostate motion and visualise prostate location day after day before each irradiation: CT-scan, cone-beam-CT-Scan, ultrason, prostatic markers... The knowledge of prostate motion is necessary to define the minimal margin around the target volume needed to avoid mispositioning during treatment session. Different kind of prostate movement have been studied and are reported in the present work: namely, those having a large amplitude extending through out the whole treatment period on one hand; and those with a shorter amplitude happening during treatment session one the other hand. The long lasting movement are mostly anterior-posterior (3 mm standard deviation), secondary in cranial-caudal (1-2 mm standard deviation) and lateral directions (0.5-1 mm standard deviation). They are mostly due to the rectal state of filling and mildly due to bladder filling or inferior limbs position. On the other hand, the shorter movement that occurs during the treatment session is mostly variation of position around a steady point represented by the apex. Ones again, the rectal filling state is the principle cause. This way, during the 20 minutes of a treatment session, including the positioning of the patient, a movement of less than 3 mm could be expected when the rectum is empty. Ideally, real time imaging tools should allow an accurate localisation of the prostate and the adaptation of the dosimetry before each treatment session in a time envelope not exceeding 20 minutes.","1769":"Combination of surgery and radiotherapy has become a standard regimen in multiple cancers. Because of its toxicity and the higher metastatic potential of lung cancer, leading to underestimate the impact of loco-regional treatments, this strategy is currently used only in a clinical trial setting. Recent results from phase III studies comparing surgery and radiotherapy in stage IIIA-N2 locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer after induction treatment showed that surgery should only be performed in patients presenting with a major mediastinal downstaging and possible curative resection within a lobectomy. In all other cases, exclusive chemoradiation remains the therapeutic standard at the time. In this way, all patients with stage III non-small cell lung cancer may receive induction treatment, consisting either in chemotherapy or in sequential or concurrent chemoradiation, which has shown its feasibility and its efficacy regarding tumor response, resectability and local control rates. These two induction regimens are currently compared in randomized trials including stage III resectable and unresectable tumors at time of diagnosis. These developments make treatment of locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer a model for multimodal strategies in oncology, combining chemotherapy, radiotherapy and surgery.","1770":"The development of sophisticated conformal radiation therapy techniques for prostate cancer, such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy, implies precise and accurate targeting. Inter- and intrafraction prostate motion can be significant and should be characterized, unless the target volume may occasionally be missed. Indeed, bony landmark-based portal imaging does not provide the positional information for soft-tissue targets (prostate and seminal vesicles) or critical organs (rectum and bladder). In this article, we describe various prostate localization systems used before or during the fraction: rectal balloon, intraprostatic fiducials, ultrasound-based localization, integrated CT\/linear accelerator system, megavoltage or kilovoltage cone-beam CT, Calypso 4D localization system tomotherapy, Cyberknife and Exactrac X-Ray 6D. The clinical benefit in using such prostate localization tools is not proven by randomized studies and the feasibility has just been established for some of these techniques. Nevertheless, these systems should improve local control by a more accurate delivery of an increased prescribed dose in a reduced planning target volume.","1771":"The use of conformal radiotherapy in lung cancer has considerably evolved with the advent of improved staging technologies and methods of radiation delivery. Patients with limited disease, inoperable for medical reasons, may be treated with conformal radiotherapy alone; patients with more advanced disease are treated with combined chemo-radiotherapy. If local control may be improved by radiotherapy dose escalation according to several studies, toxicity and more particularly pulmonary toxicity seems to be related to radiation volume. Thus the use of elective nodal irradiation is being questioned. Data for early stage (stage I) non-small-cell lung cancer treated with conformal radiotherapy or stereotactic hypofractionated radiotherapy strongly supports the use of smaller fields that do not incorporate elective nodal regions; local control and survival rates approach those of surgical series. In locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, eliminating elective nodal irradiation allows to maximize tumor dose and minimize normal tissue toxicity in combined modality treatments; results are encouraging. The use of staging modalities such as positron emission tomography and eventually oesophageal ultrasonography is increasing, allowing to encompass the tumor volume with more accuracy. Several studies have confirmed that involved-field irradiation results into a regional nodal rate of less than 10%. Further larger-scale studies would be needed to definitely establish \"no elective nodal irradiation\" as a standard in non-small cell lung cancer. There are very few data concerning small cell lung cancer.","1772":"In order to support adoption and dissemination into clinical practice of innovative treatment strategies, being almost by definition more expensive than the corresponding standard treatments, an appropriate reimbursement is a prerequisite. This article describes different possible financing systems in the context of technological advances in radiation oncology and analyses if and how the reimbursement issue has been tackled in European radiotherapy centres.","1773":"Prophylactic cranial irradiation (PCI) has become part of the standard treatment in patients with small cell lung cancer (SCLC) in complete remission. Not only does it decrease the risk of brain recurrence by almost 50%, it has a significant positive effect on survival (5.4 percent increase at 3 years). As the prognosis of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) has improved with combined modality treatment, brain metastases have also become an important cause of failure (10 to 30%, approaching 50% in certain studies as in SCLC). Survival after treatment of brain metastases is poor and impact on quality of life of patients is important. As in SCLC, 4 randomised evaluating PCI in NSCLC have been carried out in the seventies and early eighties. If 3 out of 4 trials have shown a significant decrease of brain metastases, none of them demonstrated any impact on survival. Thus PCI cannot be recommended as standard treatment in NSCLC, however new trials would be needed.","1774":"Sphincter preservation for low rectal carcinoma must be evaluated with a plurifactoriel approach. Multicentric randomised studies are unable to demonstrate a relationship between complete tumoral response and conservative sphincteric rate. Intersphincteric resection technique is becoming a main factor to transform conservative indication. Complete tumoral response should not be the only purpose of future trials.","1775":"Breathing can lead to organ motions up to several centimeters. For radiotherapy of lung, these motions are generally taken into account by adding a specific margin around the target. Thus, treated volumes are often too large to allow for the high-dose values requested for local control. To manage respiratory motion, deep-inspiration breath-hold technique (DIBH) and gated radiotherapy are starting being used clinically. DIBH consists in asking the patient to perform breath-hold during the treatment and the image acquisition, DIBH level being measured by a spirometer. Gated radiotherapy consists in treating the patient at a certain phase of the free breathing. Linac is synchronized with the motion of a marker located on the patient chest. Planning images are obtained by a four-dimensional CT (4D-CT) using the same marker. We have assessed the value of these two methods. For lung treatment, compared to a standard treatment, toxicity reduction was mainly due to the lung total volume increase. It is therefore more significant for breath-hold approach. It is also due to the reduction of safety margins, which is similar for both methods. These two techniques, which have specific advantages and drawbacks, are used routinely at Curie Institute for a large proportion of lung patients, but also for some breast, liver or even Hodgkin disease treatments.","1776":"Using deformable registration methods from a phase two clinical study of air breath control during radiotherapy in patients suffering from severe respiratory insufficiency and non-small cell lung carcinoma. Between April 2002 and November 2005, 22 patients with severe respiratory insufficiency were treated with curative intent by conformal therapy combined with active breathing control. After a mean of follow-up of 22 months, the local control rate is 28% and the method is feasible despite the severe respiratory insufficiency. However the overall survival is still poor due to metastatic widespread. For the second part of the study, the clinical protocol was also used for two studies using deformable registration methods. In the first study, a deformable registration method has been developed in order to register several breath-hold 3D CT of the same patient acquired at several days of interval. It allowed quantifying the interfraction breath-hold reproducibility by analysing the resulting displacement field. For 6 patients, the breath-hold was effective, while for 2 patients, motion greater than 10 mm were detected. The second study aimed to simulate 4D images from 3D breath-hold images. Developing an ad-hoc methodology based on the interpolation of 3D dense deformation fields performed it. The approach has been validated with expert selected landmarks, with accuracy lower than 3 mm. ABC is feasible, even in case of severe insufficiency respiratory syndrome but metastatic widespread disease is still a major challenge even with an acceptable local control rate without serious side effects: regarding the deformable registration method. Such artificial 4D images could allow decreasing the dose need to acquire a full 4D image, to simulate irregular breathing pattern and to be used for 4D dosimetry planning. ","1777":"Recent publications have permitted to quantify the benefit of radiotherapy in the conservative treatment of soft tissue sarcoma of the limbs. The aim of this review is to focus on aspects of radiotherapy witch influence local control and functional outcome for early and late normal tissue damage. The evaluation of late effects is performed according to Soma-Lent (Subjective-Objective-Management-Analytic-Late Effects of Normal Tissues) classification. About complications, neurological complications are probably under estimated and are related to total dose of radiation therapy.","1778":"Induction chemoradiotherapy (CRT) may downstage locally advanced pancreatic tumors but secondary resections are unfrequent. However some responders' patients may benefit of a R0 resection. We report 18 resections among 29 locally advanced pancreatic cancers; 15 patients were treated with neoadjuvant 5-FU-cisplatin based (13) or taxotere based (2 patients) chemoradiotherapy (45 Gy), and 3 patients without histologically proven adenocarcinoma were resected without any preoperative treatment. The morbidity rate was 28% and the mortality rate was 7%; one patient died after resection (5.5%) and one died after exploration (9%). The R0 resection rate was 50%. The median survival for the resected patients was not reached and the actuarial survival at 3 years was 59%. Two specimens showed no residual tumor and the two patients were alive at 15 and 46 months without recurrence; one specimen showed less than 10% viable tumoral cells and the patient was alive at 36 months without recurrence. A mesenteric infarction was the cause of a late death at 3 years in a disease free patient (radiation induced injury of the superior mesenteric artery). The median survival of the 11 non-resected patients was 21 months and the actuarial survival at 2 years was 0%. When the number of the resected patients (18) was reported to the entire cohort of the patients with locally advanced pancreatic cancer treated during the same period in our institution, the secondary resectability rate was 9%. Preoperative chemoradiotherapy identifies poor surgical candidates through observation and may enhance the margin status of patients undergoing secondary resection for locally advanced tumors. However it remains difficult to evaluate the results in the literature because of the variations in the definitions of resectability. The best therapeutic strategy remains to be defined, because the majority of patients ultimately succumb with distant metastatic disease. ","1779":null,"1780":"The knowledge of the axillary involvement is a major prognosis factor for breast cancer and an important parameter for treatment decision. Nevertheless, two recent current medical situations have occurred in breast cancer, changing our management. First, with the development of mass screening and sentinel lymph nodes biopsies, we have to take treatment decisions based upon minimal lymph node involvement, with a clinical significance still poorly understood. Second, for the large tumors, potentially with lymph node involvement, we have to deal with tumor and lymph node under staging, after induction chemotherapy. We have to learn how to evaluate accurately those new parameters to treat the best way our patients.","1781":"In breast cancer patients, the incidence of involvement of the regional lymph nodes and the risk for developing a locoregional recurrence are highly influenced by several prognostic factors. A meta-analysis of the EBCTCG showed a reduction of about 70% of the locoregional recurrence rate with radiotherapy for all patients, independent of age, characteristics of the tumour or the administration of systemic treatment. At the same time, this meta-analysis confirmed that radiotherapy can lead to an increased risk for developing contralateral breast cancer and to an increase in the risk of non-breast cancer related mortality, mainly due to cardiac and pulmonary toxicity. Because of this, the net effect of regional radiotherapy will be strongly influenced by the individual risk factors of the patients and by the quality of the technical aspects of the radiotherapy. The thin line between the benefits of elective regional lymph node irradiation and the possible late toxicity for patients with early stage breast cancer is currently the subject of several prospective randomised trials, the results of which will only become available in several years. Moreover, recent developments in the field of novel prognostic factors will open completely new ways to be explored, which might give us new tools for estimating the individual benefit\/risk ratio for every single patient.","1782":"To analyse a new technique for prostate brachytherapy with permanent Iodine implants characterized by the use of a seed projector after a 3D dosimetric peroperative treatment planning (FIRST technique). 395 patients have been treated in France with this technique in six radiotherapy centres between November 2002 and December 2005 for a localized prostate cancer. Thirteen patients (3.3%) developped a urinary retention, and respectively 7.8 and 26.5% an acute RTOG grade 3 and 2 toxicity. The 6-weeks IPSS score was equal or lower to 15 in 73% with a 11 median IPSS value. A failure of the loading with the seed-projector, leading to a manual loading of the seeds, occurred in 9 patients (2.3%) in two centres, directly related to the loading procedure with the seed-projector in 5 cases. The median duration of the procedure was reduced by 30 minutes for the patients treated in 2005. This multicenter study establishes the feasibility of the routine use of a seed projector for permanent iodine 125 prostate implants with an initial tolerance similar to the best results published for other implants techniques. ","1783":"Radiofrequency ablation was initially used for treatment of liver primary and metastatic disease. Recently the technique has been used for treatment of kidney, bone, lung, and mammary neoplasms. Radiofrequency electrode is positioned in the target tumor under imaging guidance. For lung or bone tumors, computed tomography is the only method of guidance. Radiofrequency ablation of lung tumor is performed in order to cure the disease and consequently pre-imaging work-up must be equivalent t pre-surgical work-up. Today lung radiofrequency ablation is mostly performed in patients bearing less than 5 tumors and tumors smaller than 4 cm. In such a population of patients radiofrequency ablation has demonstrated a local efficacy of 92% at 9 months, with 95% and 87% for tumor smaller and larger than 2 cm, respectively. Survival benefit still remains unclear. Bone tumors are mostly treat for pain palliation. In a population of 45 patients with a minimal pain of 4 on a scale from 0 to 10, radiofrequency was able to provide a drop of at least 3 points in 84% of patients. Radiofrequency provides a minimally invasive cure of small tumors. It can also be used as a palliative tool.","1784":"Target localization has become increasingly important in the advent of IMRT, as treatment margins are reduced and target doses are increased with high-dose gradients outside this target volume. The in-room CT on rails-LINAC system allows CT imaging while the patient remains immobilized in the treatment position just prior to treatment. The anatomic inter- and intra-fractional variations can be therefore quantified during a course of treatment. The position of the tumour can be checked and corrected before the fraction. In case of modification of tumour shape, a re-planning of the treatment is also feasible. However, several issues remain: the integration with routine clinical treatment due to a lack of software tools, the frequency of imaging, and the cost-efficiency ratio. The clinical experience is yet very limited but CT-image-guided radiotherapy appears promising for prostate, brain and spinal tumours.","1785":"Imaging in cancer plays a capital role to guide the clinician in his choice of therapies. We will discuss the new techniques available to predict and evaluate treatment response in oncology. The method of reference to evaluate treatment response is based on the measure of lesion size. Functional imaging doesn't evaluate size, but rather a physiological or molecular feature, which is probably modified earlier in response to treatment. Dynamic contrast-enhanced functional imaging of microcirculation follows the biodistribution of a contrast agent and analyses tumour vascularization. Diffusion-weighted Magnetic Resonance Imaging differentiates free and restrained water molecules in tissues, reflecting tumor cellularity. Nuclear Magnetic Resonance spectroscopy is an application of MRI that yields information on the metabolic content of a tissue. It detects relative quantities of various molecules which differ in tumour compared to normal tissue. Positon-emission tomography using (18)FDG is a nuclear medicine technique which gives information on tissue metabolism. Captation of FDG is proportional to the proliferative activity and the number of viable cells in a tumour. Human studies concerning these techniques are still quite preliminary, and the medical community must determine their potential in clinical practice to evaluate treatment response in oncology.","1786":"Functional MRI is a technique of imaging which is developing fast as it allows non-aggressive evaluation of brain functions. Diffusion, perfusion and activation are each used to study brain responsiveness to a given task. As a pretherapeutic routine investigation, in brain tumours, it can be helpful as an additional tool to morphological MRI in evaluating the prognosis of patients.","1787":"The management of rare cancers is controversial. The role of adjuvant therapies, such as chemotherapy and radiation therapy remains unclear. The limited number of patients included in the studies cannot generally allow any consistent statistical analysis to determine either prognostic factors or the impact of surgery and adjuvant therapies on local control and long-term survival. The Rare Cancer Network is a multi-institutional cooperative group created in 1993 to initiate large retrospective studies on rare cancers with the aim of improving our knowledge in terms of management, outcome, and prognostic factors of such tumors. The network gathers more than 70 institutions from 21 countries. So far, 32 projects have been carried out. In this report we will discuss the most significant data provided by our group in several investigated diseases.","1788":"18FDG -PET is now usually included in the treatment strategy, for the staging or the diagnosis of recurrence. In lymphoma, PET is well documented for evaluation of tumour response. For solid tumours, despite good published results, the accuracy of PET has to be confirmed by large series of patients. A good interpretation of PET needs a SUV analysis. New radiotraceurs of the nuclear synthesis could certainly improve the accuracy of response evaluation by PET.","1789":"Good results obtained by the team from Boston increased the interest in pleuropneumonectomy for mesothelioma. Adjuvant high-dose hemithoracic radiation after surgical resection decreased the local recurrence rate from 35 to 13%. The high rate of peritoneal (26-31%), controlateral pleural and pericardial recurrences justify the routine practice of preoperative laparoscopy and controlateral thoracoscopy and a pleuropneumonectomy without pericardotomy and diaphragmatic resection. The diaphragm is lowered to facilitate radiotherapy. Chemotherapy may be performed postoperatively.","1790":"The advent of 3D conformal radiotherapy and intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) make possible the dose optimization to complex target volumes close to sane organs at risk. IMRT's introduction of numerous small radiation fields inherently increases delivery inaccuracies. As a consequence, the use of IMRT without precise localization of the tumor and sensitive structures, at both the planning and delivery stages, and the absence of continuous verification represent the most significant challenges to the implementation of IMRT in routine clinical use. Intensity modulated (or not) conformal radiotherapy delivery requires better precision in the definition of treatment volume, frequently if necessary. Helical tomotherapy has been designed to use CT imaging technology to plan, deliver, and verify that the delivery has been carried out as planned. The image-guided and intensity modulations processes of helical tomotherapy that enable this goal are described.","1791":"","1792":"Standard treatment of locally advanced cervical carcinoma is actually represented by concomitant chemoradiotherapy followed by brachytherapy since several randomised study results in 1999. Surgical resection after concomitant chemoradiotherapy for locally advanced cervical carcinoma is discussed without evidence of benefice on survival and because morbidity. The aim of this study is to discuss surgery after chemoradiotherapy in terms of rate of morbidity and residual tumor, rate of pelvic disease control, overall survival and disease-free survival.","1793":"The first step for treatment of bone metastases is to confirm the diagnosis, particularly if there is only one localisation, so as to exclude a primary bone tumour. Surgery and percutaneous injection of acrylic cement are both efficient to relieve pain. Their indications and timing have to be discussed in pluridisciplinary staff. Long bones metastases have to be nailed before pathologic fracture. If there is suspicion of hypervascularisation, the lesion has to be embolized before any procedure. Treatment of spinal metastases with neurological impairment is an emergency. Paraplegia may be a consequence within a few hours. They have to be treated in an orthopedic or neurosurgery department with the experience of posterior and anterior approach of the spine. Surveillance may be useful to diagnose these metastases before neurological impairment. Depending from the type of cancer, the chemo- and radiotherapy sensibility, the number of metastases, the condition of the posterior wall of the vertebra and the general condition of the patient, different surgical treatments may be possible going from complete resection of the lesion to percutaneous injection of acrylic cement. Conventional radiotherapy is associated to surgery. Satisfactory results of such treatments justify greater involvement of orthopaedic surgery team in multidisciplinary staff.","1794":"Lung cancer is lymphophile and may involve lymph nodes (LN) belonging to lung lymph drainage. LN metastases are figured within stations numbered 1 to 14. These stations are located along lymph vessels. The lymph vessels and the LN are forming together anatomical chains. Lymph vessels are valved and pulsatile and travel to the cervical venous confluence where they pour the lung lymph into the blood circulation. They may be totally or partly nodeless along their travel, anastomose with each other around the trachea, and connect with the thoracic duct within the mediastinum. Within the anatomical LN chains, LN are variable in number and in size from one individual to another. They may be absent from one or several stations of the international mapping. Stations are located along the anatomical chains: pulmonary ligament (9), tracheal bifurcation(8 and 7), right paratracheal (4R, 2R and 1), preaortic (5 and 6), left paratracheal (4L, 2L and 1). Station 3 is located on 2 differents chains (phrenic and right esophagotracheal). Station 10 are located at the beginning of the mediastinal lymph nodes chains. Each chain connects with the blood circulation, anastomoses with he neighbouring chains and behave as an own entity whatever the number of its LN. International station mapping misknowns this anatomy and occults the true pronostic value of lung lymph drainage.","1795":"Induction treatments in non-small cell lung cancer are usually discussed. Long-term survival after surgery and resecability are enhanced in locally advanced cancers. Morbidity and mortality observed after surgery limit the use of these treatments, despite they depend on many other factors: comorbidities in patient, smoking status, cancer staging, and type of surgery. Right pneumectomy enhances this risk more than left pneumectomy or other limited resections allowed by neoadjuvant treatments, especially in case of downstaging.","1796":"Optically guided ultrasound imaging has been used in our department since 2003 in order to implement an on line correction scheme in intensity modulated radiation therapy of prostate carcinoma. The corrections observed during the initial time period of the system (17 patients) are compared to those observed more recently (10 patients). Treatment margins are calculated. Overall systematic errors decreased between 2003 and 2006, and are presently statistically not different from zero. Random errors remain the same (max 4.3 mm). Proposed margins are 7 mm both in lateral and longitudinal direction and 8.4 mm in anteroposterior. Ultrasound can be used for on line correction of both positioning and internal organs motion errors and allows reduction of the margins between clinical and planning volume. ","1797":"To evaluate the accuracy of sentinel node biopsy for assessing the neck status for those patients with squamous cell carcinoma T1T2N0 of oral cavity. 55 patients were included in a prospective study between 2000 and 2003. 53 underwent a sentinel node biopsy (SNB) followed by an elective neck dissection (END). Pathological examination with stepped serial sectioning and immunohistochemistry of sentinel node (SN) has been compared with routine pathology examination of remaining END nodes. 12 patients had a positive SN. No false negative was found. Patient follow up on, at less of 3 years, did not show any node recurrence for those patients with negative SN. After that study, 44 patients had a SNB without END. 7 patients had a positive SN. Follow up showed a node recurrence for 3 patients. In two of these, pathological reexamination showed a micrometastase in SN. SN failure rate is less than 3% for those 99 patients. SNB is a liable procedure. Failure rate is the same as in END. We plan to use this procedure in orophyngeal tumors where it could be possible to reduce irradiation fields and treatment sequels for those patients with negative SN. ","1798":"The National French Federation of Comprehensive Cancer Centres (FNCLCC) initiated the update of clinical practice guideline for the management of patients with soft tissue sarcoma in collaboration with the French Sarcoma Group (GSF-GETO), specialists from French public universities, general hospitals and private clinics and with the French National Cancer Institute. This work is based on the methodology developed in the \"Standards, Options and Recommendations\" (SOR) project. To update SOR guidelines for the management of patients with soft tissue sarcoma previously validated in 1995. The methodology is based on a literature review and critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary group of experts who define the CPGsaccording to the definitions of the Standards, Options and Recommendations project. Once the guidelines have been developed, they are reviewed by independent reviewers. This article presents the updated recommendations for radiotherapeutic management. The main recommendations are: 1) irradiation before or after surgical treatment is the standard for soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity and uterine sarcoma; 2) no systematic irradiation should be done in case of retroperitoneal sarcoma. ","1799":"Conformal radiation therapy with or without intensity modulation is the standard treatment of localized prostate cancer and facilitates dose escalation. The implementation of three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy necessitates focusing on target volume delineation, dosimetry, reproducibility of treatment and quality control. Recently, ultrasound systems that allow direct daily visualization of the prostate have become available. This non-invasive technique can be used to correct both prostate organ motion and set-up error and leads to increase treatment accuracy.","1800":"The development of conformal radiotherapy techniques (CRT) and intensity modulated CRT requires an accurate delineation of target structures and organs at risk. Thus, additional information provided by anatomical and\/or functional imaging modalities can be used for volume of interest determination combined with traditionally used Computed Tomography imaging (CT): for instance, functional or morphological Magnetic Resonance Imaging (f MRI or m MRI) or Positron Emission Tomography (PET). A prerequisite to the simultaneous use of this information is image registration. Due to the differences between the images and the information they provide, a quality control of image registration process for radiotherapy is mandatory. The purpose of this article is to present the difficulties in implementing such controls and to show the necessity for a clinical validation on patient's images. The last part of this work presents the possible interest in using f MRI to help radio-oncologists in the treatment planning for gliomas associated to image coregistration and quality control considerations.","1801":"To evaluate survival and prognostic factors of 108 patients with clinically or mammographically detected ductal carcinoma in situ (DCIS), treated from 1980 to 1996 by complete local excision followed by external irradiation. The median age was 51 (range 37-80). All the patients underwent surgery consisting of a wide resection of the mammary gland harbouring the tumour. The surgical specimens were sent to the pathologists to get information on histology and margin clearance; all the slides were reviewed by one of us to assess the tumoral diameter. External beam therapy was delivered within 8 weeks after surgery. The prescribed irradiation dose was 50 Gy in 25 fractions to be given in 5 weeks. The median duration of follow-up was 93 months (range 40-173). There were nine patients with local recurrence (8.3%); three patients had local recurrence of DCIS and six patients developed invasive breast cancer. The treatment of local recurrence consisted of mastectomy with or without axillary dissection (eight cases) and quadrantectomy (one case). The 5-year and 10-year ipsilateral recurrence-free rate was respectively 92 and 89%. The 10-year cause specific survival was 100%. In univariate analysis, size&gt;or=10 mm, age&lt;45 years old and margin status were significant P=0,02, P=0,03, P=0,005; margin status was significant in multivariate analysis (P&lt;0,02). These results are in keeping with those of the literature. They could be improved by the mass screening campaign, which is going on since January 1990 among women aged 50-74 years. ","1802":"In the seventies, limb-sparing surgery and radiation therapy appeared capable of successfully treating the great majority of adult patients with soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities. No survival benefit could be demonstrated in the patients selected for amputation. Microscopically positive surgical margins are related to a greater risk of local recurrence, whereas overall survival is compromised by high grade and large tumor size. Presurgery multidisciplinary discussion, management in reference center and management within cancer network independently predict conformity to the clinical practice guidelines. Reoperation should be a planned part of definitive management whenever the initial surgical procedure was done without a histologic diagnosis or was not planned to be a wide excision. Soft tissue flap reconstruction facilitates therapy for patients with locally advanced tumors so that patients with larger tumors can undergo resection, limiting complications and limb sacrifice. Vascular reconstruction is a feasible option in case of involvement of major vessels. Isolated limb perfusion (ILP) with TNF and chemotherapy is an efficient limb-sparing neoadjuvant therapy for locally advanced limb soft tissue sarcomas. Efficacy and safety of low-dose TNFalpha could greatly facilitate ILP procedures in the near future.","1803":"Brachytherapy plays a fundamental role in the therapeutic approach of patients with stage I-IV cervical carcinoma. Technical modalities have evolved during the last decades: stepping source technology, imaging modalities development, specially IMN, treatment planning system integrating 3D images. Images from CT-Scan and MRI have contributed to a better knowledge of tumoral extension and critical organs. CT and\/or MRI compatible applicators allow a sectional image based approach with a better definition of tumour volume compared to traditional approaches. The introduction of 3D image based approach for GTV and CTV requires new definitions and a common language. In 2000, a working group within GEC-ESTRO was created to support 3D image based 3D treatment planning approach in cervix cancer BT. The task was to determine a common terminology enabling various groups to use a common language. Recommendations were described and proposed based on clinical experience and dosimetric concepts of different institutions. Two CTVs were described en relation to the risk for recurrence: high-risk CTV and intermediate risk CTV. In order to better define the role of such definitions and their potential impact on the complication incidence in patients with cervical cancer, a special French programme was developed. The aim of this programme is to study the incidence of the severe 2-year complication rate in two comparable patient populations: one population is treated using PDR brachytherapy with CT-Scan or MRI with the applicators in place allowing a 3D dosimetry with optimization, the second population is treated using standard X-rays radiographs without any delineation of the target nor optimisation. Each population arm includes 425 patients. A medicoeconomic assessment is performed, allowing a real cost of the most sophisticated approach compared to a historical dosimetric system.","1804":"Image-guided radiation therapy (IGRT) can be used to measure and correct positional errors for target and critical structures immediately prior to or during treatment delivery. Some of the most recent available methods applied for target localization are: transabdominal ultrasound, implanted markers with in room MV or kV X-rays, optical surface tracking systems, implantable electromagnetic markers, in room CT such as kVCT on rail, kilovoltage or megavoltage cone-beam CT (CBCT) and helical megavoltage CT. The verification of the accurate treatment position in conjunction with detailed anatomical information before every fraction can be essential for the outcome of the treatment. In this paper we present the on-board imager (OBI, Varian Medical Systems, Palo Alto, CA) that has been in routine clinical use at the Karolinska University Hospital since June 2004. The OBI has been used for on-line set-up correction of prostate patients using internal gold markers. Displacements of these markers can be monitored radiographically during the treatment course and the registered marker shifts act as a surrogate for prostate motion. For this purpose, on-board kV-kV seems to be an ideal system in terms of image quality. The CBCT function of OBI was installed in March 2005 at our department. It focuses on localizing tumors based on internal anatomy, not just on the conventional external marks or tattoos. The CBCT system provides the capacity for soft tissue imaging in the treatment position and real-time radiographic monitoring during treatment delivery.","1805":"We report the case of a 57-year-old man who presented with two local recurrences and metastatic dissemination of a papillary meningioma of the sphenoid 3 years after surgery. Treatment consisted in a combination of surgery for the local recurrence in the initial site, radiotherapy and chemotherapy for bone metastases. Evolution of the disease spread over 7.5 years. The literature relating metastatic meningiomas is reviewed; prognostic factors and main therapeutic protocols are discussed.","1806":"Respiration-gated radiotherapy offers a significant potential for improvement in the irradiation of tumour sites affected by respiratory motion such as lung, breast and liver tumours. An increased conformality of irradiation fields leading to decreased complications rates of organs at risk (lung, heart) is expected. Four main strategies are used to reduce respiratory motion effects: integration of respiratory movements into treatment planning, breath-hold techniques, respiratory gating techniques, and tracking techniques. Measurements of respiratory movements can be performed either in a representative sample of the general population, or directly on the patient before irradiation. The measured amplitude could be applied to a geometrical margin or integrated into dosimetry. However, these strategies remain limited for very mobile tumours, in which this approach results in larger irradiated volumes. Reduction of breathing motion can be achieved by using either breath-hold techniques or respiration synchronized gating techniques. Breath-hold can be achieved with active techniques, in which a valve temporarily blocks airflow of the patient, or passive techniques, in which the patient voluntarily breath-holds. Synchronized gating techniques use external devices to predict the phase of the respiration cycle while the patient breaths freely. Another category is tumour tracking, which consists of two major aspects: real-time localization of, and real-time beam adaptation to, a constantly moving tumour. These techniques are presently being investigated in several medical centres worldwide. Although promising, the first results obtained in lung and liver cancer patients require confirmation. This paper describes the most frequently used gating and tracking techniques and the main published clinical reports.","1807":"The Megavoltage cone-beam (MV CBCT) system consists of a new a-Si flat panel adapted for MV imaging and an integrated workflow application allowing the automatic acquisition of projection images, cone-beam CT image reconstruction, CT to CBCT image registration and couch position adjustment. This provides a 3D patient anatomy volume in the actual treatment position, relative to the treatment isocenter, moments before the dose delivery, that can be tightly aligned to the planning CT, allowing verification and correction of the patient position, detection of anatomical changes and dose calculation. In this paper, we present the main advantages and performance of this MV CBCT system and summarize the different clinical applications. Examples of the image-guided treatment process from the acquisition of the MV CBCT scan to the correction of the couch position and dose delivery will be presented for spinal and lung lesions and for head and neck, and prostate cancers.","1808":"The Cyberknife is an image-guided robotic radiosurgery system. The image guidance system includes a kilovoltage X-ray imaging source and amorphous silica detectors. The radiation delivery device is a mobile X-band linear accelerator mounted onto a robotic arm. Through a highly complex interplay between the image guidance system, an automated couch, and the high-speed linear accelerator, near real-time tracking of the target is achieved. The Cyberknife gained Federal Drug Administration clearance in the United States in 2001 for treatment of tumors \"anywhere in the body where radiation treatment is indicated.\" Because the Cyberknife system does not rely on rigid fixation of a stereotactic frame, tumors outside of the intracranial compartment, even those tumors that move with respiration can be treated with a similar degree of ease as intracranial targets. A description of the Cyberknife technology and a review of some of the current intracranial and extracranial applications are detailed herein.","1809":"In this paper the clinical introduction of stereoscopic kV-imaging in combination with a 6 degrees-of-freedom (6 DOF) robotics system and breathing synchronized irradiation will be discussed in view of optimally reducing interfractional as well as intrafractional geometric uncertainties in conformal radiation therapy. Extracranial cases represent approximately 70% of the patient population on the NOVALIS treatment machine (BrainLAB A.G., Germany) at the AZ-VUB, which is largely due to the efficiency of the real-time positioning features of the kV-imaging system. The prostate case will be used as an example of those target volumes showing considerable changes in position from day-to-day, yet with negligible motion during the actual course of the treatment. As such it will be used to illustrate the on-line target localization using kV-imaging and 6 DOF patient adjustment with and without implanted radio-opaque markers prior to treatment. Small lung lesion will be used to illustrate the system's potential to synchronize the irradiation with breathing in coping with intrafractional organ motion.","1810":"If surgery remains the cornerstone for the curative treatment of non-small cell lung cancer, failures are common especially for stage III disease and adjuvant treatment (chemotherapy or radiotherapy) may be justified. After the two meta-analyses, new trials have showed a moderate but significant benefit from cisplatin based chemotherapy. The role of radiotherapy is still controversial but from some clinical observations, a new trial using the modern radiation technology should address the question.","1811":"Epidural localization is a rare presenting sign of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. These tumours are classified in the majority of cases as large B cell lymphomas. Low grade lymphomas are rarely reported. We report a 43-year-old woman admitted for a total functional disability of the two lower limbs. Magnetic resonance imaging revealed a spinal epidural mass extending from D7 to D9. A laminectomy was performed. The histopathological study revealed a follicular lymphoma. The patient underwent a spinal irradiation and chemotherapy. Follow up evaluation at 16 months demonstrated no evidence of relapse. Our purpose is to describe the clinical features, the pathologic findings, the treatment and the prognosis of non-Hodgkin's lymphoma revealed by an epidural involvement.","1812":"Although never proven to be superior in a large, prospective randomized trial, surgical resection remains the treatment of choice for early stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). In stages IA, IB, IIA, IIB and resectable IIIA surgical treatment offers the best long-term prognosis when a complete resection can be performed. Standard operations include lobectomy, bilobectomy and pneumonectomy. Whenever possible, lobectomy is the procedure of choice. Lesser resections like segmentectomy or wedge excision are rarely indicated in primary NSCLC. Specific lung parenchyma saving operations include tracheo- and bronchoplastic procedures which are indicated in selected cases of centrally located NSCLC. Extended resections include removal of lung together with another organ or structure as thoracic wall, pericardium, diaphragm or superior sulcus. En bloc excision of the involved structure is advised. Accurate peroperative evaluation will determine the extent of resection and if possible, a pneumonectomy should be avoided because of its high mortality and morbidity rate. Surgical resection after induction therapy for early stage or locally advanced NSCLC is feasible, but is often more complex and carries a higher risk, especially when a right pneumonectomy has to be performed after induction chemoradiotherapy.","1813":"Giant cell tumors of the skull base are rare neoplasms. This report reviews two cases of patients presenting with aggressive giant cell tumors that were irradiated by a combination of photons and protons. Two females 29 and 14 years old were initially managed with one and three extensive surgical resections respectively. Radiation therapy was recommended in respect to tumor aggressiveness. Combined proton and photon radiation therapy was performed based on a three-dimensional planning, and delivered a total dose of 59.4 CGE to 65.2 CGE respectively, administered in 5 sessions per week of 1.8-2 Gy\/CGE (Cobalt Gray Equivalent). With 8 and 83 months follow-up, respectively, the youngest patient relapsed marginally 4 months post irradiation, while the second remained with NED. No complication developed in any of them. In conclusion, we have reviewed a total of 116 cases (114 previously published cases+2 new cases) and discuss the role and modalities of radiation therapy in the management of giant cell skull base tumors.","1814":"The objective of this retrospective study was to discuss the epidemioclinical criteria and the therapeutic results of metastatic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The current study concerned 95 patients with histologically proven nasopharyngeal carcinoma who were metastatic at diagnosis or who had developed late metastasis. We reviewed the epidemioclinical records of all the patients. Patients were treated with chemotherapy (BEC regimen: bleomycin, epirubicin and cisplatin or PBF regimen: bleomycin, 5-fluorouacil and cisplatin) and radiotherapy of pauci metastatic localizations (single or double) or bone metastasis with high risk of compression or fracture+\/-associated with locoregional radiotherapy for patients who were metastatic at diagnosis. Response was assessed according to the WHO criteria. Overall survival was calculated according to the Kaplan-Meier method. A long-term disease-free survival was defined from 36 months. There were 34 patients who were metastatic at diagnosis and 61 patients who had developed late metastasis. The mean age was 41.5 years (sex-ratio: 3.1). Bone metastases were the most frequent (83%). Objective and complete response rates were respectively 75% and 70%, and 32% and 16% for BEC and PBF regimens. Twenty-five patients received radiotherapy for pauci metastatic localizations, among whom 19 patients who were metastatic at diagnosis received locoregional irradiation. The overall survival probability was of 15% for three years. Eleven patients were long survivors (extremes: 36 and 134 months). Therapeutic results were comparable to those reported in other series using platin combination chemotherapy. Radiotherapy of metastasis yielded to long-term survival. ","1815":"","1816":"Spindle cells hemangioendotheloma generally reaches the extremities. Only one oropharyngeal localisation was described in the literature. We report the observation of a 41 years old patient who was operated twice for this localization. The patient presented in 2005 with a third recurrence with important local extension contraindicating surgical treatment. An external radiotherapy was carried out with a good local control of the lesion. In the light of this observation we will discuss physiopathology of this rare lesion and the various therapeutic options.","1817":"In 1996, a multicenter randomized study comparing after breast-conservative surgery, sequential vs concurrent adjuvant chemotherapy (CT) with radiation therapy (RT) was initiated (ARCOSEIN study). Seven hundred sixteen patients were included in this trial. After a median follow-up of 6.7 (4.3-9) years, we decided to prospectively evaluate the late effects of these two strategies. A total of 297 patients were asked to follow-up from the five larger including institutions. Seventy-two percent (214 patients) were eligible for late toxicity. After breast-conserving surgery with axillary dissection, patients were treated either with sequential treatment with CT first followed by RT (arm A) or CT administered concurrently with RT (arm B). In all patients, CT regimen combined mitoxantrone (12 mg\/m(2)), 5-FU (500 mg\/m(2)), and cyclophosphamide (500 mg\/m(2)), 6 cycles (day 1-day 21). In arm B, patients received concurrently the first 3 cycles of CT with RT. In arm A, RT started 3 to 5 weeks after the 6th cycle of CT. Conventional RT was delivered to the whole breast using a 2 Gy-fraction protocol to a total dose of 50 Gy (+\/-boost to the primary tumour bed). The assessment of toxicity was blinded to treatment and was graded by the radiation oncologist according to the LENT-SOMA scale. Skin pigmentation was also evaluated using a personal 5-points scoring system (excellent, good, moderate, poor, very poor). Among the 214 evaluated patients, 107 were treated in each arm. The two populations were homogeneous for patients', tumors' and treatment characteristics. Subcutaneous fibrosis (SF), telengectasia (T), skin pigmentation (SP), and breast atrophy (BA) were significantly increased in arm B. Twenty patients experienced grade superior or equal to 2 (SF) in arm B vs five in arm A (P=0.003). Twenty-five and seven patients showed grade superior or equal to 2 (T) in arm B and A, respectively (P=0.001). Forty-four and twenty patients showed grade superior or equal to 2 (BA) in arm B and A, respectively (P=0.0006). Thirty patients experienced grade superior or equal to 3 (SP) in arm B vs fifteen in arm A (P=0.02). No statistical difference was observed between the two arms concerning grade superior or equal to 2 pain, breast oedema, and lymphoedema. No deaths were caused by late toxicity. Following breast conserving surgery, the concurrent use of CT with RT is significantly associated with an increase incidence of grade 2 or greater late side effects. ","1818":"The rhabdoid cerebral tumors were first identified by Briner et al. in 1985. Their frequency was estimated to be 2.1% of those affecting children under 18 months. Such tumors are equally characterized by a critically and speedly mortal development. Their historical genesis is still of a controversial issue. The aim of the present study was to discuss the various anatomicoclinical and therapeutic aspects of these rare tumors. We report five cases diagnosed over a period of eight years (1997-2004) in the Laboratory of Anatomy and Pathological Cytology of the University Hospital of Sfax. The average age of patients was 20 years old, there were children under 14 years and 4 patients were male. Clinical symptomatology showed the predominance of intra-cranial hypertension syndrome. Radiography through magnetic resonance revealed a heterogeneous tumor process localized respectively on the spine (one case), the insula (one case), the temporofrontal lobes (two cases) and the medulla (one case). Histological examination of the tumors also showed a proliferation of giant cells with a hyaline-based cytoplasmic inclusion. These inclusions were positive for vimentin and keratin. An adjuvant radiotherapy treatment was prescribed for two patients. A recurrence of rhabdoid tumors occurred in two cases. All five patients died within eighteen months. The cerebral rhabdoid malignant tumor constitutes one of the most aggressive and life-threatening intracranial tumors. The optimal management of such tumors remains unknown. ","1819":null,"1820":"Ependymoma is rare glial tumour of the central nervous system and is considered to be low-grade. The lumbosacral location of spinal ependymoma is the most common. Prognosis of ependymomas is dependent on tumour location, histological subtype and differentiation, extent of the tumour and of the completeness of the surgical resection. One of the characteristics of this kind of tumour is to present the possibility of a seeding of the entire cerebrospinal axis, by the way of cerebrospinal liquid. We describe the case of a young male patient operated by incomplete resection of a lumbar ependymoma. Six months later, the patient's symptoms reappeared and an external radiotherapy at curative doses and chemotherapy were delivered. Evolution of the remaining tumour was diagnosed 6 years after at the primary site and operated by large incomplete resection. A second session of radiotherapy was therefore administered. Twenty-four years after this episode, cervical pain and gait troubles appear. Complete imaging study concluded to a cervical extramedullary intradural tumour and to the persistence of the primary lumbosacral tumour. Macroscopical complete resection of the cervical tumour was performed and pathological findings concluded to a metastasis of his lumbar ependymoma. External radiotherapy was delivered on this site with a total dose of 50 Gy. Eight years after this episode, the patient is alive without evidence of distant disease. The primary lumbosacral ependymoma is stable. Ependymomas are often recurrent at the primary site, but can seed on the entire cerebrospinal axis. Awareness of such aberrant tumoral behaviour, even after such a long disease free interval, may warrant more careful follow-up of patients with this diagnosis.","1821":"Between twenty and to forty percent of patients will develop an isolated PSA failure after a radical prostatectomy. Pelvic irradiation is a therapeutic option with curative intention. It is the best therapeutic option for young people with good prognostic factors. Combined radiation with hormonal or chemotherapy should be evaluated in patients with poor prognostic factors. For patients with a short life expectancy, hormonotherapy or a watch and see policy are acceptable options.","1822":"Purpose. - To analyse outcomes after interstitial brachytherapy of facial periorificial skin carcinomas. Patients and methods. - We performed a retrospective analysis of 97 skin carcinomas (88 basal cell carcinomas (BCCs), 9 squamous cell carcinomas (SCCs)) of the nose, periorbital areas and ears from 40 previously untreated patients (group 1) and 57 patients who had undergone surgery (group 2). The average dose was 55 Gy [50-65] in group 1 and 52 Gy [50-60] in group 2 (mean implantation times: 79 and 74 hours respectively). We calculated survival rates and assessed functional and cosmetic results de visu. Results. - Median age was 71 years [17-97]. There were 29 T1, 8 T2, 1 T3 and 2 Tx tumors in group 1. Tumors were&lt;2 cm in group 2. Local control was 92.5% in group 1 and 88% in group 2 (median follow-up: 55 months [6-132]). Five-year disease-free survival was better in group 1 (91% [75-97]) than in group 2 (80% [62-90]), P=0.23. Of the 34 patients whose results were re-assessed, eight presented pruritus or epiphora. One group 2 patient had an impaired eyelid aperture. Cosmetic results were better in group 1 than in group 2, with respectively 72% (8\/11) vs 52% (12\/23) of good results and 28 (3\/11) vs. 43% (10\/23) of fair results. Conclusion. - Brachytherapy provided a high level of local control and good cosmetic results for facial periorificial skin carcinomas that pose problems of surgical reconstruction. Results were better for untreated tumors than for incompletely excised tumors or tumors recurring after surgery.","1823":"","1824":"Orchiectomy with adjuvant radiotherapy of retroperitoneal paraaortic and ipsilateral iliac nodes is the standard treatment for localized testicular seminoma (I, IIA, IIB). Post therapeutic follow-up allows to detect local relapse and radio-induced second cancer. Nevertheless, evaluation of risk of second malignancy still remains difficult. We report 2 cases of rectal cancer after radiotherapy for testicular seminoma.","1825":"","1826":"Soft tissue sarcomas are rare and may be a source of problems for diagnosis and treatment. Four types of genetic disorders can be distinguished: translocations, gene amplifications, mutations and complex genetic imbalances. Detection of these disorders may help in diagnosis and in determining prognosis. Detection of specific translocation is recommended in synovial sarcoma, alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma or PNET diagnosis because of therapeutic consequences; in case of rarer histologic type (low grade fibromyxoid sarcoma, clear cell sarcoma, infantile fibrosarcoma...), it may confirm the diagnosis. In some cases, some translocations have a prognostic value (alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma) whereas it is discussed in others (synovial sarcoma). The techniques used to detect these translocations are very sensitive so it may be used to detect microscopical metastasis (bone marrow metastasis of alveolar rhabdomyosarcoma for example). Detection of MDM2 and CDK4 genes amplifications (FISH or quantitative PCR) may be sometimes useful in well differentiated and dedifferentiated liposarcomas diagnosis. Mutation detection of KIT or PDGFRA may help in GIST diagnosis and type of mutation is predictive of response to treatment. Study of complex genomic imbalances in sarcomas is not used in routine practice but remains useful in research.","1827":"In soft tissue sarcoma, surgical resection remains the cornerstone of therapy for localized disease. Quality of margins is very important to evaluate. In case of marginal or incomplete resection, a new enlarged surgical resection should always be discussed before administration of any adjuvant treatments. Many retrospective studies and 2 randomized studies (one of adjuvant brachytherapy and one of external beam radiotherapy) have shown that adjuvant radiotherapy after complete surgery reduces significantly the risk of local recurrence in extremity soft tissue sarcomas. Combination of surgery and pre- or postoperative radiotherapy has therefore become the standard treatment with a local recurrence rate &lt;or=25% and very few amputations. A recent randomized study has compared pre-op to postoperative radiotherapy. The results in terms of local control are similar in both arms (93 and 92% at 5 years) but the risk of early complications is higher in the preoperative arm and the risk of late sequela is higher in the postoperative arm. Surgical resection without radiotherapy may be considered after discussion at best within a multidisciplinary meeting, if surgical margins are considered satisfactory, in superficial, small tumours and low-grade. In retroperitoneal sarcomas, adjuvant radiotherapy is not a standard. It may decrease the risk of local recurrence but at the price of an increased gastro-intestinal toxicity. A randomized trial is warranted. Because of its rarity, and the risk of recurrence both local and metastatic, treatment should preferentially be discussed with a multimodality specialized approach.","1828":"Despite they represent an heterogeneous entity, the same protocols were applied to all subtypes of soft-tissue sarcomas until recently. Although doxorubicin and ifosfamide remain the cornerstone of therapy, their association yields enhanced response rates but has no obvious effect on survival. The benefit of adjuvant therapy is still matter of debate; however, it seems to improve relapse-free survival and might of particular interest for patients with high-grade tumours of the extremities. Yet, the major change occurring over the past few years is probably the development of subtype-specific regimens. Whether targeted therapies could provide additional benefit is a major concern but further studies are needed.","1829":"Leiomyosarcomas of diaphragm are exceptional. Since 1935 only eight cases have been published. We report a new case of a 18-year-old man who consulted for an abdominal mass. Ultrasonography revealed a kystic and septated mass measuring 157 mm of diameter. Tomodensitometry showed a sus-mesocolic and voluminous left tumoral mass wish was widely necrosed. The mass was displacing the stomach on the right. A widely surgical resection of tumour was performed. Diagnosis of leiomyosarcoma of diaphragm was performed by pathological study. The outcome was marked by tumour recurrence three months later. The patient died after six months. The review of literature show that prognosis of diaphragmatic leiomyosarcomas is poor.","1830":"","1831":"Chemotherapy of sarcomas includes two major drugs: doxorubicin, ifosfamide and a third, dacarbazine, whose effectiveness remains marginal. The current challenge consists in improving the combination of these drugs, in particular by modulating their amounts. New molecules of chemotherapy show their efficiency in sarcomas. Among those, one will note above all gemcitabine and ET-743, in some sub-types. Target therapies and antiangiogenic treatment have also begun to show results. It is advisable from now on to distinguish the different sub-type of sarcomas in order to assess cytotoxic activity.","1832":"The soft tissue sarcomas are a rare pathology and patient management complex. Good clinical practice should be delineated by rigorous recommendations. In case of suspicion of a sarcoma, precise assessment imagery must be carried out with a biopsy to allow the preparation of the surgical procedure. The surgical procedure should be extensive and complete to enable a macroscopic and microscopic resection. The adjuvant treatment could involve radiotherapy and chemotherapy whose indications should be specified within a multidisciplinary team. Unfortunately, recent studies showed no optimal management for majority of patients treated for sarcomas.","1833":"Traditional radiation treatment planning relies on density imaging such as Computed Tomography for anatomic information of various structures of interest including target and normal tissues. However, the difficulties to distinguish malignant from normal tissue on CT slides often leads to inaccurate outlining of the GTV and\/or to geographic misses. 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography (FDG-PET) has shown an increase in both sensitivity and specificity over CT in locoregional staging of patients with non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). The co registration of FDG-PET images to the data of the CT planning offers the radiation oncologist the possibility to include functional information into the target outlining. For the treatment of patients with NSCLC, it has been shown that the use of FDG-PET images: 1) modified the shape and volume of radiation fields in 22-62% of cases, mainly due to a better nodal staging and distinction of atelectasis from tumor and; 2) significatively reduced the interobserver and intraobserver variability. This paper reviews the results reported in the literature. Challenges and proposed solutions are discussed.","1834":"During the last half of century considerable research on radiosensitivity biomarkers has been published. However, to date there is no non-invasive marker of cellular radiosensitivity identified for clinical routinely use. In this review, the main functional and metabolic imaging isotopic techniques for tumor radiosensitivity that have been explored over the last years are being described. This indirect evaluation fall into 3 topics associated with tumor proliferation rate or apoptosis, tumor hypoxic fraction, neoangiogenesis and the intrinsic radiosensitivity of clonogenic tumor cells. The final objective of the radiosensitivity monitoring during radiotherapy would be to adapt treatment strategy for overcoming the identified radioresistance mechanism such as hypoxia by the addition of radiosensitisers for example. This would allow better tumor control rather than continue inefficient and costly treatment delivery, which in addition could compromise outcome.","1835":"Over the last fifteen years, pathology underwent significant changes in the field of soft tissue tumours. They were related to considerable advances in molecular biology and genetics. New data led to the revision of the WHO classification. Malignant fibrous histiocytoma is no longer considered as an entity. It has split up into several subgroups belonging to liposarcomas, leiomyosarcomas or undifferentiated sarcomas. Haemangiopericytoma underwent reappraisal and was put in the same category as solitary fibrous tumour. Many tools have improved. Immunohistochemistry performed with new antibodies had its specificity increased, and became appropriate for the prediction of therapeutic response in some cases, e.g. CD117 detecting mutations of the c-kit proto-oncogen in gastro-intestinal stromal tumours. Refinement of the techniques allows accurate diagnoses from core needle biopsies. Surgical specimens are collegially examined by surgeons and pathologists with special attention paid to resection margins. Although bound by some limitations, the grading system of the French Federation of Cancer Centers has currently remained the best predictor of metastasis-free survival and overall survival of patients. It is based on an assessment of three parameters: differentiation, amount of necrosis, and mitotic count of tumours. The pathologist sets up a diagnosis, and actively takes part in the prediction of the prognosis and therapeutic response. He is one of the major participants in decision making for multimodal treatment of sarcomas.","1836":"We report three cases of Hodgkin's disease (HD) involving the nasopharynx. Their clinical presentations, morphological and immunohistochimical features and their therapy modalities are discussed. The patients were aged 36, 41 and 77, presenting with increasing bilateral nasal obstruction in one case and a cervical mass in the two others. Histological study showed mixed cellularity type of HD in all cases. The Reed Sternberg cells expressed both of CD15 and CD30 in one case, and only one of them in the other cases. In one case, LMP1 was detected, CD20 and CD3 were not. HD of nasopharynx should be differentiated from EBV-associated lymphoproliferations. The treatment is based on radiotherapy that can be associated to neoadjuvant chemotherapy if nodes are involved.","1837":"For this review of surgery in soft tissue sarcoma, we reviewed literature and added our personal experience. In front of a soft tissue tumour, the major objective is to think it could be a sarcoma. Diagnosis actually is made by core needle biopsies, but sometimes a surgical biopsy is needed. Surgical resection is better defined since ten years and distinguishes resection R0 (in sano), R1 (microscopic residual disease) and R2 (macroscopic residual disease). Quality of resection is determined collegially by confrontation of surgical and pathological reports according recommendations of the French Sarcoma Group (FSG). The risk of local recurrence depends on resection-type and tumour grade. With the help of the surgical classification from FSG, local prognosis is better understood and treatment can be adapted to individual tumours. In experienced hands, local recurrence can be pushed down to near 10 against 20% formerly. Severe complications after sarcoma surgery occur in 14% of cases. Functional outcome studies have benefited from new scoring systems, which complete each other. Isolated limb perfusion is a method that could save limbs in some desperate situations. Due to rarity and treatment specifications, soft tissue sarcoma should be treated in specialised centres. ","1838":"Renal medullary carcinoma is an aggressive malignant tumour, recently reported in the literature. It is usually reported in the relatively young patients with drepanocytic trai. Histologically, the tumour is constituted by a tumoral proliferation with diffuse or glandular architecture and inflammatory stroma. The carcinomatous cells have plasmocytoid or rhabdoid aspect. We report a case of 40 years old man who presented macroscopic hematuria. Through this observation and the review of the literature we discuss the anatomoclinical and the prognostic aspects of this exceptional tumour.","1839":"The role of brachytherapy in the therapeutic strategy of soft tissue sarcomas has been difficult to assess due to the fact it has been during a long time institution-specific. However, the experience gained specially with low dose-rate treatments has allowed formulating guidelines for technical rules and patient selection. Brachytherapy used as an isolated treatment combined with surgery has proven to be effective in high-grade sarcomas, compared to surgery alone, in a unique randomized trial. Beside, a number of data have shown that the combination of brachytherapy and external beam irradiation could be superior to brachytherapy or external beam irradiation alone in the treatment of tumors with high-grade, or central location, locally advanced or on contact with neurovascular structures. Brachytherapy alone, combined with surgery, is of interest for conservative treatment of recurrent sarcomas occurring in previously irradiated areas. The occurrence of side effects remains acceptable if technical guidelines are followed, for surgery as well as for brachytherapy, using the most modern available treatment techniques. Brachytherapy should be at the moment an integrated part of the multidisciplinary treatment of soft tissue sarcomas.","1840":"Retroperitoneal sarcomas comprise approximately 15% of all soft tissue sarcomas and 50% of all retroperitoneal tumours. Helical CT of the abdomen and pelvis, with selective use of MRI will establish the extent of the tumour, its retroperitoneal location, the degree of necrosis, and the evidence of metastasis. A CT guided core needle biopsy is the optimal pre operative tissue sampling. A complete surgical resection is the mainstay of the treatment with a rim of normal tissue that often requires removal of adjacent organs. The 5-year probability of local control is approximately 50%. The role of adjuvant therapy is evolving and at present should not be used outside the investigational setting.","1841":"Adjuvant radiotherapy to the breast plays a significant role in preventing local failure in women treated for early stage breast cancer. This fact is supported by multiple clinical trials demonstrating that adjuvant radiotherapy decreases the risk of local recurrence and increases the rate of breast preservation, and actually the rules of adjuvant breast irradiation are clearly established. Sarcomas are a rare but recognized complication of radiation therapy for breast carcinoma, and are associated with poor prognosis. The first case of a bone sarcoma after radiation therapy of breast cancer was described by Beck in 1922. In 1948, Cahan et al. defined the criteria for diagnosis of radiation-induced sarcoma. Since then, some studies have reported the incidence of radiation-induced sarcoma after radiotherapy for different cancers. This article reports and discusses the incidence, management and treatment outcome of radiation-induced sarcomas occurring after radiotherapy for breast cancer in our institute. The incidence, histology, latency of appearance, genesis, their treatment and the prognostic factors of these rare tumors are discussed and the literature is reviewed.","1842":"After treatment of primary soft tissue sarcoma, a third of patients will develop local or distant (lung in 90% of cases) recurrence. For an individual patient, the issue of cancer recurrence is a binary event. However, when developing surveillance strategies for large groups of patients, knowledge of the risks (tumor biology, natural history of the disease), the benefits (potential efficacy of salvage therapy) and diagnosis test performances is necessary to formulate a rationale and resource effective follow-up algorithm.","1843":"After prostatectomy, radiotherapy is a potential curable treatment. From the surgery series, it is possible to identify all the localization at risk in case of biochemical relapse after prostatectomy. The target volume of irradiation has to be defined according to the pathological findings. The CTV is limited to the pelvic fascia laterally, to the anterior wall of the rectum behind. The inferior limit includes the anastomosis, and the superior is easier to define with the length of the prostatic gland. The inclusion of area of seminal vesicles and pelvic node areas should be discussed. The use of surgical clips on the anastomosis and image fusionning techniques including the preoperative imaging would help physicians to define the CTV's limits.","1844":"Soft tissue sarcomas are uncommon heterogeneous group of tumour derived from mesenchym. The most common location is the lower extremity, but they can occur in the upper extremity, and abdominal and chest walls. The first radiological evaluation may include plain films and ultrasonography in viewing to assess the probability of soft tissue sarcomas. MRI with contrast is the main modality to evaluate these lesions and choose which part of tumour must be biopsied. Computer tomography (CT) is secondary used to perform core needle biopsy and detect lung metastases. The role of PET begins to be more clear in case of need global assessment before radical surgery. A multidisciplinary approach is essential to perform rational treatment planning and avoid partial surgery.","1845":"In 2004, three new important laws were passed concerning radiotherapy services. The first two concerns the internal and external quality control of linear accelerators and the last concerns the role of the medical physicist, whose presence was made mandatory during the whole length of the treatments. These laws, which aim to improve the quality and the security of treatments, represent an increase in price that we have calculated, and which prevents them being implemented, as a joint study realised by the SFRO and the SFPM has shown. The cost of quality in radiotherapy requires investment in material and manpower and improvement in availability of the accelerators which entails a complete reorganisation of the services. Cost analysis is included. The difficulties in implementing these laws have also been evaluated and this evaluation already enables us to propose certain elements enabling us to go forward to globally improve the quality and security in radiotherapy.","1846":"During the 5 past national courses organised by the French society of radiation oncology (SFRO), three different types of survey were performed to analyse demography, motivations and quality of training of the young specialists. During the 5 past years, 50 radiation oncologists were training for the whole country (about 15 per year were graduated). A recent increase the number of young specialists is observed with a total number of 50 in 2000 to 75 in 2005. Nevertheless, the number of young specialists is dramatically insufficient and exposes for the future to an important demographic crisis. Analysis of motivations of choice for radiation oncology confirms the influence of a practical stage of oncology during the second cycle of the medical studies for 60% of the young specialists. Analysis of practical and theoretical training was performed according to the point of view and living experiences of the students. On the other hand, informations from teachers were less complete. Some needs are emphased as: 1) the quality of the follow during the training (importance of the recent implementation of a logbook); 2) importance of theoretical and practical training at the radiotherapy department; 3) help and incentive for research and scientific publication.","1847":"To assess the significance of S-phase fraction (SPF) and DNA ploidy evaluated by DNA flow cytometry as prognostic markers in stage I or II breast cancer. A series of 271 patients, treated by surgery, radiotherapy+\/-systemic therapy was analysed (median follow up: 64 months). Standardized flow cytometry cell preparation from frozen samples and consensus rules for data interpretation were followed. Three SPF classes were defined on the basis of tertiles after adjustment for ploidy. Four groups were defined based on combinations of DNA ploidy (DIP: diploid; ANEUP: aneuploid) and SPF: DIP and low SPF (DL, N=37), DIP and medium or high SPF (DMH, N=76), ANEUP and low SPF (AL, N=24), ANEUP and medium or high SPF (AMH, N=68). Local control rate (LCR), disease-free survival (DFS), metastasis-free survival (MFS), and overall survival (OS) were correlated with DNA ploidy, SPF, DL to AMH groups, T and N stages, SBR grading, age, and hormonal status on univariate and multivariate analysis (Cox model). On univariate analysis, DFS and LCR were higher for DIP tumours. High SPF values were associated with shorter DFS. LCR, MFS, DFS, and OS rates were significantly different with an increasingly poorer prognosis from DL to AMH. On multivariate analysis, groups DL to AMH, histological node involvement and T stage were independently associated with MFS, and DFS. In N- patients, DL to AMH remained independent for MFS and DFS. For SBR III tumours, MFS and OS were significantly different in DL to AMH groups. These results strongly support the use of combined evaluation of DNA ploidy and SPF as independent parameters in clinical trials for N- stage I and II breast cancer. ","1848":"Surgery is often not a treatment option in patients with hepatocellular carcinoma with the numerous limitations of liver transplantation or surgical resection due to coexisting cirrhosis in the later case. Non-surgical treatments deal with 3 types of methods: local ablation with curative purpose, transarterial treatments with many technical variants and systemic treatment. Local treatments rely on chemical or thermic agents to achieve ablation of liver lesions, which not exceed initially 3 cm in diameter. The use of radiofrequency ablation allows now larger limits. Intra-arterial treatment usually combines intra-arterial chemotherapy with embolisation of hepatic artery in a procedure called chemoembolisation. Its antitumoral effect mainly due to ischemia is well documented but the influence on survival remains controversial. Finally systemic treatments have yet to be demonstrated useful: new agents and new randomised trials are still needed.","1849":"The aim of this work is to study the epidemiological, clinical and evolutive characteristics of the erysipela in patients treated for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). Between January 1993 and June 2003, 212 patients were treated for NPC in the radiotherapy department of Sfax hospital. Twenty-two patients among them have presented an erysipela. A neoadjuvant chemotherapy was used for 16 patients with N2-N3 disease. Locoregional radiotherapy was delivered for all of patients. The mean age was 35 years (range: 10 and 69), sex-ratio was 1.2. The median delay between the appearance of erysipela and the end of the treatment was 16 months. The main localisation was the face. The main clinical manifestations were fever in 86% of cases and erythema in 77% of cases. Immediate evolution was favorable in all cases after antibiotherapy. Recurrences were observed in 45% in cases. Erysipela is a common skin infection readly found in patients with venous insufficiency. In our study we found a significant correlation between the frequency of erysipela and dystrophic complications. The incidence of erysipela in the face and cervical region after radiotherapy is unknown. ","1850":"Relapse after radical prostatectomy is strongly correlated with clinical stage, Gleason score and surgical margins. Adjuvant radiotherapy for high-risk group seems to be the best treatment and final results of EORTC will give definitive response. Regarding biological relapses, radiotherapy allows a cure rate of 50% if this treatment begins promptly after raising PSA. The role of concomitant hormonotherapy is still pending waiting for the results of the new AFU\/GETUG protocol.","1851":"Hepatocellular carcinoma is one of the most prevalent tumors worldwide and its incidence is increasing due to hepatitis C virus infection. Other etiologic factors are hepatitis B virus infection, alcoholic liver disease and hemochromatosis. This tumor mainly develops in cirrhotic livers that are true precancerous states. Although mechanisms of hepatocarcinogenesis remain badly known, some signaling pathways are frequently deregulated: inactivation of the p53 tumor suppressor factor in 25% of HCC, activation of the Wnt signaling and the telomerase immortalization enzyme in most of tumors. Hepatitis viruses play a direct oncogenic role by interaction between viral proteins and cellular ones, which control cell homeostasis, or by integration of hepatitis B virus genome into the host genome. Furthermore, hepatitis viruses play an indirect oncogenic role by chronic inflammation and hepatocyte regeneration related to viral hepatopathy. In a near future, a better understanding of virus-specific oncogenic mechanisms should allow us to set up innovative preventive and curative therapeutic strategies.","1852":"Adjuvant Radiotherapy has been shown to significantly reduce locoregional recurrence but this advantage is associated with increased cardiovascular and pulmonary morbidities. All uncertainties inherent to conformal radiation therapy must be identified in order to increase the precision of treatment; misestimation of these uncertainties increases the potential risk of geometrical misses with, as a consequence, underdosage of the tumor and\/or overdosage of healthy tissues. Geometric uncertainties due to respiratory movements or set-up errors are well known. Two strategies have been proposed to limit their effect: quantification of these uncertainties, which are then taken into account in the final calculation of safety margins and\/or reduction of respiratory and set-up uncertainties by an efficient immobilization or gating systems. Measured on portal films with two tangential fields, CLD (central lung distance), defined as the distance between the deep field edge and the interior chest wall at the central axis, seems to be the best predictor of set-up uncertainties. Using CLD, estimated mean set-up errors from the literature are 3.8 and 3.2 mm for the systematic and random errors respectively. These depend partly on the type of immobilization device and could be reduced by the use of portal imaging systems. Furthermore, breast is mobile during respiration with motion amplitude as high as 0.8 to 10 mm in the anteroposterior direction. Respiratory gating techniques, currently on evaluation, have the potential to reduce effect of these movements. Each radiotherapy department should perform its own assessments and determine the geometric uncertainties with respect of the equipment used and its particular treatment practices. This paper is a review of the main geometric uncertainties in breast treatment, due to respiration and set-up, and solutions proposed to limit their impact.","1853":"Low-dose brachytherapy for prostate cancer was actually proposed in the first years of the XXth century. Its modern version (iodin 125 or palladium 103 permanent implants) now benefits from some 15 years of experience in a few pioneer centers, with very satisfactory results in term of efficacy\/toxicity ratio. More recently, a high-dose rate (HDR) prostate brachytherapy technique has been introduced. Initially utilized essentially as a \"boost\" irradiation combined with external radiotherapy, it is now being proposed by some authors as a monotherapy for selected localized prostate cancers. Although sophisticated radiobiological models have been proposed to compare those two dose-rates, they are not considered to be valid and reliable enough to compare such different irradiation schemes (A low-dose rate irradiation lasting several months vs a few high-dose fractions given in a few days). When it comes to the implantation techniques, it seems that most of the technical problems which arose for both schemes have been solved, and that the experience of a given team is now much more important than the technique itself. Clinical results cannot be reliably compared so far, the follow-up of the patients treated by HDR brachytherapy being usually shorter, and the patients treated with HDR usually presenting with more advanced lesions. Radioprotection features are very different, with no accident reported for low-dose rate implants. For HDR no irradiation is given at all to the staff and family during a normal application, but one has to face the threat of manipulating high activity sources, with a few accidents or incidents reported in the literature. Financial studies show that for more than 20-30 patients treated in a year, HDR is more economical, although a decrease in the cost of the seeds could change the picture. In conclusion, for low-risk localized prostate cancer, it does not appear reasonable to give up using a low-dose rate technique, which proved to be both efficient and poorly toxic. This actually corresponds to the recent GEC-ESTRO recommendations. For the other patients, a dose escalation is appealing: this could be performed using brachytherapy (LDR or HDR), with or without hormonotherapy. Several trials are ongoing or will be activated very soon to try and answer.","1854":"Presently, radiotherapy is rarely an upfront treatment in patients with lymphomas. The modern evolution of radiation treatment calls for the development of therapeutic niches in which radiotherapy remains absolutely necessary. The development of new imaging techniques and their use in radiation planning systems along with new sophisticated radiation delivery techniques such as IMRT and respiratory gating should permit an increased accuracy an increased accuracy in the treatment of tumor masses and a decrease in late normal tissue complications.","1855":"Breast radiotherapy is still in progress. The target volumes - whole breast and lymph nodes - are usually located by clinical palpation and the use of bony landmarks. However computed tomography has allowed a better definition of the deep edge of the volumes and the calculation of 3D dose distributions. A survey of 194 centers has started in June 2005 in France. The questionnaire that was sent included questions about general techniques in breast radiotherapy. Preliminary results on 50 centers showed that patient anatomical data were in the vast majority acquired by a simulator-CT or a CT (for 92%). In the 50 departments, beam placement is done either directly at the simulator (20 centers), or on the TPS (16 centers). Virtual simulation software is used in 8 centers. In about 20% (11) radiotherapy departments, 3D target volumes are contoured and the beams adapted to their shapes.","1856":"To compare conventional 2D simulation and virtual simulation on 14 patients with breast cancer. Patients were simulated for treatment using standard procedure. They subsequently underwent CT scan in the treatment position. The CTV was defined as breast tissue. The PTV was obtained by adding a 3D margin of 1 cm around CTV. Organs at risk (lungs and heart) were outlined. Ballistics and dose distribution obtained with the two planning methods were compared. With conventional simulation, 95% of CTV received 95% of the dose prescribed. Virtual simulation significantly improved dosimetric coverage of PTV without increasing irradiation volume of lung and heart. In 2D simulation, using three slices allowed optimisation by adjusting wedge angle. The five-slice plan was a much better predictor of the maximum dose regions when compared to the three-slice plan. Using entire CT data didn't give any benefit. Variations in CTV delineation and PTV definition limit interest of virtual simulation. In classic simulation, a 5 CT slice-plan can be used to optimise dose distribution. ","1857":"RTOG and EORTC randomised phase III trials investigated combination of radiation therapy and hormonal treatment in locally advanced prostate cancer T2c-T4 N0-1 M0 (UICC 2002). Complete androgen blockade initiated 2 months prior to starting radiotherapy and stopped at the completion of radiotherapy vs radiation therapy alone, increased overall survival in patients with Gleason score 2-6. Adjuvant androgen suppression started at the end of the radiotherapy and continued indefinitely improved significantly overall survival of patients Gleason score 8 to 10. Complete androgen blockade in two months before and two months during radiation followed by 24 additional months of LHRH analogue alone improved overall survival of patients Gleason score 8-10 with respect to CAB alone. EORTC trial 22861 has shown that androgen suppression with LHRH analogue given during and for 3 years after external irradiation improved overall survival whatever the Gleason score. The role of hormonal treatment is currently assessed in localized prostate cancer (T1-2 N0) with poor prognostic factors: Gleason score 8-10, PSA&gt;20 ng\/ml.","1858":"Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is the most frequent primitive cancer of the liver. It mostly develops on cirrhotic livers. Orthotopic liver transplantation is the only treatment that definitively addresses both the metachronous occurrence risk of HCC and the underlying disease. Under Milan criteria, i.e. less than 3 nodules of 3 cm max in diameter, or 1 nodule of 5 cm maximum, OLT has been shown effective and provides with survival rates almost equal to those obtained with HCC free cirrhotic patients. In Rennes, 195 patients with early HCC on cirrhotic livers have been transplanted from January 1995 to June 2005. Global and disease free 8 years patient survival rates were 73 and 70%, respectively. These results were significantly altered when the recipient was female, the cirrhosis due to C virus and the patient of B blood group. Despite these excellent results, the principal limit to the application of transplantation for HCC remains the long period of time patients have to wait for a graft. During this period of time, growth of the tumour may drop the patient out of Milan criteria and subsequently from the waiting list. The role of chemoembolisation, liver resection and thermal ablation while the patient is waiting for a graft remains debatable.","1859":"Hypofractionation (i.e. the use of fewer higher fractional doses than usual) is not a new concept. It had actually been proposed in the early year of Radiotherapy by the German and Austrian specialists. In the seventy's, supported by the - wrong - hypotheses which gave birth to the NSD (Nominal Standard Dose), hypofractionation reappears. The consequential increase of late complications which was observed led the radiation oncologists to give up again using large doses per fraction, except for a few specific situations, such as palliative treatments. We are recently facing a new \"come-back\" of hypofractionation, in particular for breast and prostate cancers. In the case of breast cancer, the aim is clearly to look for more \"convenience\" for both the patients and the physicians, proposing shorter irradiation schedules including a lesser number of fractions. Some \"modestly\" hypofractionated schemes have been proposed and used, without apparently altering the efficacy\/toxicity ratio, but these results have been seriously questioned. As for prostate cancer, the situation is different, since in that case new radiobiological data are at the origin of the newly proposed hypofractionation schedules. A number of papers actually strongly suggested that the fractionation sensitivity of prostate cancer could be higher than the one of the tissues responsible for late toxicity (i.e the exact opposite of the classical dogma). Based on those data, several hypofractionated schemes have been proposed, with a few preliminary results looking similar to the ones obtained by the classical schedules. However, no randomised study is available so far, and a few recent radiobiological data are now questioning the new dogma of the high fractionation sensitivity of prostate cancer. For those two - frequent - cancers, it seems therefore that prudence should prevail before altering classical irradiation schedules which have proven their efficacy, while staying open to new concepts and proposing well-designed randomised trials in specific cases.","1860":"Brachytherapy with permanent implants is a validated method of treatment of prostate adenocarcinomas of favourable prognosis. Its technology is based on endorectal ultrasonography and on peroperative visualisation of the implant and the dose distribution. A strict selection of the patients is necessary before this localised treatment. An active collaboration between urologists, radiophysicists and radiation oncologists is necessary during all the process of selection, treatment and follow-up of the patients. An assessment of the carcinologic and functional results is necessary. Recommendations are formalized by a joint collaboration between members of the AFU and of the SFRO.","1861":"The cost of radiotherapy, which concerns 150,000 new patients yearly in France has been estimated 1700 euros per patients in this country, 50% lower than the European average. Economic evaluations of radiotherapy have related the cost of either curative or palliative treatment to the medical outcome. For lung, rectal, breast cancer and bone metastases of prostate cancer, radiation therapy prolongs life by an estimated 6 to 10 months. The cost effectiveness ranges from 5,000 to 25,000 euros per life year gained.","1862":"While some patients presenting with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) benefit from curative therapies (transplantation, surgery, percutaneous ablation), others are only candidates for palliative options such as chemoembolization or symptomatic care. Although conventional external-beam radiotherapy of the liver is regarded as little efficient and potentially toxic in cirrhotic patients, 3-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (CRT), by decreasing the amount of normal liver included in the radiation portal, allows dose escalation to occur without increasing the risk of radiation-induced hepatitis. This trial was designed to assess the efficacy and tolerance of CRT for small-size HCC in cirrhotic patients. Prospective phase II trial including stage A\/B cirrhotic patients with small-size HCC not suitable for curative treatments; CRT consisted in a standard fractionation radiation, with a total dose of 66 Gy. Twenty-seven patients were included, 15 of whom had previously been treated for HCC; mean age was 68. Among the 23 assessable patients, 18 (78%) presented with complete response, 3 (13%) with partial response, and 2 with no response. Acute complications occurred in 24 patients, and were mainly acceptable (grade 1\/2: 22 patients, grade 3\/4: 11 patients, 4 (15%) of whom had clinical and\/or hematological toxicities). Only 2 (9%) grade 3\/4 clinical and\/or hematological late toxicities are reported. CRT is a non-invasive curative technique highly suitable for small-size HCC in cirrhotic patients; further investigations are needed to compare it to the other available treatments, and to integrate it into the curative therapeutic algorithm of HCC. ","1863":"Incidence of malignant pleural mesothelioma will rise until 2030-2040 because the elapsed time between exposure and diagnostic is up to several decades. Prognosis remains very poor with median survival less than one year and five-year survival not exceeding 5%. As compared to 1999, standart treatment adds chemotherapy with cisplatin and pemetrexed to local radiotherapy for prevention of local seeding after invasive diagnostic procedures. Despite various growth factors and their receptors are involved in malignant mesothelioma, first clinical trials of targeted therapies reported poor results. Multimodality therapy with extrapleural pneumonectomy and radiation therapy (+\/-chemotherapy) can be of benefit in subgroups of patients but it cannot be recommended in a routine approach. As compared to bronchial carcinoma, inclusion of patients in clinical trials (using intensity-modulated radiation therapy) is the only way to somewhat improve results.","1864":null,"1865":"Purpose of radiation treatment after conservative surgery for breast cancer is improvement of long-term local control rate and reduction of heart and pulmonary toxic events for women with long life expectancy. Breast irradiation with intensity modulation might be promising, as results of treatment planning (dose-volume histogram and normal tissue complication probability) showed. Project of our study is to evaluate the advantage of each following techniques: wedged plans, electronic compensation and intensity modulation.","1866":"Chondrosarcoma is a malignant tumor relatively rare on the larynx, and raises diagnostic and therapeutic difficulties. Its diagnosis often requires the recourse to a radiological, endoscopic and anatomopathologic confrontation. Its treatment is exclusively surgical. It is based on broad excision sometimes mutilating and requires in this kind of localization a multidisciplinary collaboration between ORL, vascular surgeon and radiotherapy. In the light of a new very conclusive observation and data of the literature, we wanted to give a progress report on the clinical and therapeutic positions of the various authors.","1867":"We describe a case of a young woman with a history of an aplastic anaemia in which pelvic radiotherapy was used successfully in the management of a recurrent and inoperable endometriosis. The use of therapeutic pelvic or ovarian irradiation in endometriosis may be considered, when surgical and medical treatments have been exhausted and have failed.","1868":"In 1983, Walsh introduced anatomical radical retropubic prostatectomy. With the surgical modifications that preserve neurovascular bundles, excellent cancer control can be achieved, while preserving erectile function and urinary continence in most appropriately selected patients. Since them, radical prostatectomy has become the most common treatment for clinically localized prostate cancer. Treatment results following radical prostatectomy will most likely continue to improve in the future as early detection is more widely practiced.","1869":"A retrospective study to re-assess the indications for postoperative radiation therapy in squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx staged N0 after gross resection. Between January 1975 and December 2000, 166 patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the larynx were treated by total laryngectomy with or without neck dissection. Surgery was completed by external radiotherapy delivering 45 to 65 Gy to the tumour bed and 45 to 50 Gy to cervical lymphatic chains. Minimal follow-up was 36 months and median follow-up was 98 months. The rate of nodal recurrence was 6% (median time for relapse was 9 months). The survival rates at 1, 2, 3 and 5 years were 93.5, 84, 80 and 69% respectively, with a 8 year 3 month median survival. The univariate analysis showed 4 parameters, which significantly increased the risk of local recurrence: the medical necessity for immediate tracheotomy, the subglottic involvement, the involvement of the whole larynx and the presence of lymphatic embols in the neck dissection. There was no statistically significant difference between the patients with or without a neck dissection. Fifty-nine secondary cancers were observed, 15 of them occurring in the head and neck area. The late complications consisted of cervical subcutaneous fibrosis (7%), oesophageal stricture (4%), oeso-tracheal fistula (l%), hypothyroidism (3%), bone necrosis (1%). Prophylactic cervical radiotherapy in laryngeal cancers resulted in 6% cervical node recurrence rate. This value may represent the maximal rate to accept if one would favour new therapeutic strategies based on restricted indications for radiotherapy. ","1870":"Despite a follow-up too short to allow a relevant assessment of the HIFU efficacy in terms of definitive cure of localized prostate cancer, the last published results from the European multicentric study and from Gelet may consider the HIFU treatment as a valuable alternative option for well differentiated tumors, with an initial PSA&lt;15 ng\/ml, in men with a life expectancy more than 5 years. The main advantages of the HIFU treatment are its low morbidity, the option for repeated HIFU treatment, the possible treatment of patients who previously underwent prostate resection, the early local control with biopsies and, if needed, radiotherapy may be performed after HIFU, without increased morbidity.","1871":"Adenoid cystic carcinomas in the trachea are rare, but represent around 40% of all tracheal tumours. Other intrathoracic localisations include the carena or proximal airways. Adenoid cystic carcinoma's growth rate is slow so that it is frequently diagnosed at an advanced stage. Pathological identification may be difficult. Treatment in limited tumours is based upon surgical resection often combined to radiotherapy because of close surgical margins. Radiotherapy dose may vary between 45 and 65 Gy according to margins status. Five-year survival rates of 65-80% have been reported after surgery or surgery and postoperative radiotherapy. Among inoperable patients treated with exclusive radiotherapy for tracheal tumours (including adenoid cystic but also squamous cell carcinomas of poorer prognosis), the recommended delivered dose should be over 60 Gy. Five-year survival rate in these very heterogeneous series may vary between 12 and 27%. Local or metastatic recurrences may occur very lately. They are considered chemo-resistant and targeted therapies may prove to be effective in the future.","1872":"Thymomas and thymic carcinomas are rare and slow-growing tumors, which develop within the anterior mediastinum. Thymomas are often associated with autoimmune disorders and most particularly myasthenia gravis. The treatment of choice remains a complete surgical resection. Postoperative radiotherapy is often combined in case of invasive thymoma invading into adjacent organs. Postoperative radiotherapy in stage II with invasion into capsule has been more controversial lately. In inoperable locally advanced, or metastatic thymic tumors, neoadjuvant cisplatin-based followed by surgery and radiotherapy has given interesting results in the past years.","1873":"In the following review of the literature, the reasons and consequences of a tendency to the increase of the delay between the diagnosis and the first irradiation session will be studied. The duration of the delay varies according to the protocol of treatment, which itself depends on the tumour. Moreover, all types of radiotherapy are concerned by the increase in delay. A retrospective study enables to determine for a given series of similar tumours and treatments the mean duration of delay and find the excessive duration. The increase of delay phenomenon exists in different countries. We know that before irradiation the tumour grows according to its biological characteristics and the TNM initial determination will no longer be true. On the other hand, effective treatments such as chemotherapy and hormone therapy are increasingly used alone, before or in combination with radiotherapy. Consequently, the classical timing of radiation therapy could be modified often delayed. It is difficult to consider that successive treatments are a real increase of delay and compare its results with previous data from radiotherapy alone. We will study its impact in three types of tumours, including tumours of head and neck, of the breast and prostate, which are the most widely reported. The consequences of prolonged delay are not easily evaluated: one of the more important parameters is the possible modification of the stage of tumour. This phenomenon is not restricted to the studied types of tumours. We will try to find possible ways of reducing abnormal delays before irradiation.","1874":"Conformal radiation therapy has now to be considered as a standard treatment of localized prostatic adenocarcinomas. Using conformational methods and intensity modulated radiation therapy requires a rigorous approach for their implementation in routine, focused on the reproducibility of the treatment, target volume definitions, dosimetry, quality control, setup positioning. In order to offer to the largest number of patients high-dose treatment, the clinicians must integrate as prognostic factors accurate definition of microscopic extension as well as the tolerance threshold of critical organs. High-dose delivery is expected to be most efficient in intermediary risks and locally advanced diseases. Intensity modulated radiation therapy is specifically dedicated to dose escalation. Perfect knowledge of classical constraints of conformal radiation therapy is required. Using such an approach in routine needs a learning curve including the physicists and a specific quality assurance program.","1875":"The prognosis of glioblastoma remains extremely poor. Clinical research has been very active for thirty years, and has explored all the concepts developed in the laboratories of radiobiology. Radiosensitisation of hypoxic tumours, hyperfractioned radiotherapy, external beam radiotherapy plus stereotactic radiosurgery or brachytherapy boost, and intensity modulated radiation therapy failed to improve the results of the treatment of these patients. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy has just obtained a new success in the treatment of glioblastoma. The addition of temozolomide to radiotherapy resulted in a statistically significant survival benefit with minimal acute additional toxicity. The challenge remains to improve clinical outcomes further, and some new research pathways are open.","1876":"To report a retrospective study concerning the impact of fused 18F-fluorodeoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) images on three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT) planning for patients with non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). One hundred and one patients consecutively treated for stages I-III NSCLC were studied. Each patient underwent CT and FDG-hybrid PET for simulation treatment in the same radiation treatment position. Images were coregistered using five fiducial markers. Target volume delineation was initially performed on the CT images and the corresponding FDG-PET data were subsequently used as an overlay to the CT data to define target volume. FDG-PET identified previously undetected distant metastatic disease in 8 patients making them ineligible for curative CRT (one patient presented some positive uptakes corresponding to concomitant pulmonary tuberculosis). Another patient was ineligible for curative treatment because fused CT\/PET images demonstrated excessively extensive intrathoracic disease. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was decreased by CT\/PET image fusion in 21 patients (23%) and was increased in 24 patients (26%). The GTV reduction was &gt; or = 25% in 7 patients because CT\/PET image fusion reduced pulmonary GTV in 6 patients (3 patients with atelectasis) and mediastinal nodal GTV in 1 patient. The GTV increase was &gt; or = 25% in 14 patients due to an increase of the pulmonary GTV in 11 patients (4 patients with atelectasis) and detection of occult mediastinal lymph node involvement in 3 patients. Among 81 patients receiving a total dose &gt; or = 60 Gy at ICRU point, after CT\/PET image fusion, the percentage of total lung volume receiving more than 20 Gy (VL20) increased in 15 cases and decreased in 22 cases. The percentage of total heart volume receiving more than 36 Gy increased in 8 patients and decreased in 14 patients. The spinal cord volume receiving at least 45 Gy (2 patients) decreased. After multivariate analysis, one single independent factor made significant effect of FDG\/PET on the modification of the size of the GTV: tumor with atelectasis (P = 0.0001). Conclusion. - Our study confirms that integrated hybrid PET\/CT in the treatment position and coregistered images have an impact on treatment planning and management of patients with NSCLC. FDG images using dedicated PET scanners with modern image fusion techniques and respiration-gated acquisition protocols could improve CT\/PET image coregistration. However, prospective studies with histological correlation are necessary and the impact on treatment outcome remains to be demonstrated. ","1877":"This article reviews the concept of selectivity in peritumoral microscopic disease to be included in the Clinical Target Volume (CTV) for elective treatment for oral cavity and oropharyngeal squamous cell carcinoma, using the local tumoral spread. The objective of the present article is to present a procedure for the delineation of the target volumes, required for an appropriate application of 3-DCRT and IMRT for head and neck cancers. These propositions are for the delineation of microscopic peritumoral target volumes when external beam irradiation is required. CTVs are illustrated on CT sections.","1878":"The objective of this paper is to give some practical landmarks for the delineation of target volumes and organs at risk in Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy for Nasopharyngeal Carcinoma. This delineation, drawn from anatomo-clinical data, natural history of the disease and radiological pre-treatment evaluation, seems to be easier to define than the delineation of other head and neck cancer localisations (oropharynx and oral cavity for example). Experience inside national and international cooperative groups should tend to standardize this initial and fundamental step of Nasopharyngeal Conformal Radiotherapy.","1879":"The quality of treatment that one can realize today in conformal radiotherapy, can be reached only if one has access to 3D imaging allowing a precise determination of the volume of the organs at risk and of the GTV. For this reason, one has access to anatomical imaging, CT or MRI, and functional and metabolic imaging, PET or SPECT imaging. CT gives the electronic density of the tissues, which is essential to ensure a very precise calculation of dose distribution. Its insufficiency in the visualization of the tumour and some anatomical structures makes necessary the registration of these images with MRI of which distortions are sufficiently weak to be usable in radiotherapy. The registration will be usable only if images of each modality are realised with the patient in treatment position, except for brain, where only CT, on which is based the registration, must be done in treatment position. The images registration is also called images fusion by some authors. Others consider fusion of images as a way to display registered images on a screen, specially for CT images and PET, and MRI and SPECT. Nevertheless, the fusion of images is a function offered by some softwares. It allows obtaining a single volume of voxels from those of the registered images (CT and MR images). This volume is not usable in radiotherapy because it keeps only partially the contributions of the CT scan images and the MRI. At least, if one wants to visualize the active parts of a tumour or to make the difference between fibrosis and tumour left or recurrence after radiotherapy or chemotherapy, it is necessary to use PET or SPECT. To define correctly the CTV using these images, one must realize the anatomical localization of the metabolic abnormalities, which they highlight with a registration based on CT or MRI. The difficulties to obtain the registration of these images led the manufacturer to propose mixed machines allowing realizing, at the same time, a CT imaging and a PET or a SPECT imaging with the patient in treatment position.","1880":"This work proposes to study the anatomoclinical, therapeutic and evolutionary characteristics of the malignant tumours of the nasal cavities. This study focuses exclusively on the malignant tumours strictly of the endonasal variety (excluding tumours from the olfactive placode and those extending to the paranasal cavitie). These tumours are not common not often studied in the literature and their is not codified (classification, treatment). A new classification of the malignant tumours (strictly endonasals varieties) is presented in this study. This is a retrospective study of 21 malignant tumours of the nasal cavities selected between January 1989 and December 2001. The handling of these tumours rests on a tripod diagnosis: nasal endoscopy-imagery-biopsy. The following parameters are studied: epidemiological, histopathological, clinical, therapeutic and evolutionary. The average age of our population is 52,4 years with a male sex ratio of 1,3. The nasal obstruction is the principal revealing sign (82%) followed by the epistaxis (14,2%). The septal tumours are the most frequent (10 cases). The histopathological results of our study show the prevalence of the epithelial tumours: epidermoid carcinoma (8\/21), adenocarcinoma (2\/21) malignant melanoma (2\/21). The non-epithelial varieties are dominated by lymphomas (NLH) (8\/21). The surgery plays a dominant role in the treatment of these tumours. Most of the tumours were operated on, usually transfacially and often with postoperative radiotherapy. The endoscopic surgery was not valided. Our results show on the one hand the gravity of certain tumoral varieties: malignant melanoma, lymphomas(NHL) and on the other hand the overall unfavourable forecast of these tumours with a mortality rate of 42,8%. The malignant tumours of the nasal fossae, in particular in the specific context of this study (strict endonasal tumours) are rare and their handling is not codified. They are dominated by the epithelial malignant varieties, in particular in their septal localizations. The evolutionary profile is dominated by the loco regional recurrence. The forecast of these tumours is overall bad according to the tumoral stage, especially the histopathological varieties. ","1881":"Ovarian metastasis as first dissemination site of a lung adenocarcinoma has not been described in the literature. We report the case of a 61-year-old woman who had a pneumectomy for a centrally located lung adenocarcinoma, which was discovered on a routine chest X-Ray. During the follow-up, a Positron Emission Tomography (PET)-Scan showed a hypercaptation in the pelvic region. Abdominal CT-scan confirmed the presence of a mass which was compatible with a primary ovarian tumor. The patient underwent a hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy. Pathology reported an adenocarcinoma. Immunohistochemical staining revealed cells expression for Thyroid Transcription Factor 1 (TTF-1), cytokeratin 7 (CK-7) and focally cytokeratin 20 (CK-20). Clinical course, pathological and immunohistochemical data concluded to the diagnosis of ovarian metastasis of the lung adenocarcinoma. In conclusion, in the differential diagnosis of an ovarian metastasis, clinicians should not forget the lung as primary site since epidemiologic data of lung cancer in women show progressive incidence.","1882":"The analysis of the impact of breast and uterus cancer and their treatments on sexual function remains a tricky approach, especially due to some difficulties of communication between patient and medical staff. Some cultural, social, physiological and psychological considerations can change the evolution of sexual function during and after cancer treatment. For breast cancer, mastectomy or conservative approach, as well as radiotherapy and chemotherapy, can induce a modification of body image, femininity, power of seduction and sexuality. For uterus cancer, radio-surgical treatments can induce local (shrinking or vagina dryness,...) or general (early menopause) modifications leading to a decrease of sexual relations. The present analysis of the literature gives a better knowledge of the sexual function troubles according to the type, stage and treatment of the cancer as well as the context in which it appears, especially in regard to personal, family (couple relation before the disease occurrence), social and cultural considerations. A critical point is to introduce, as soon as possible, in the therapeutic program, a global approach including side effects on sexual function and to analyze very carefully the own ability of the patient to manage the difficulties occurring during the treatment.","1883":"To study the impact of fused (18)F-fluoro-deoxy-D-glucose (FDG)-hybrid positron emission tomography (PET) and computed tomography (CT) images on conformal radiation therapy (CRT) planning for patients with esophageal carcinoma. Thirty-four patients with esophageal carcinoma were referred for concomitant radiotherapy and chemotherapy with radical intent. Each patient underwent CT and FDG-hybrid PET for simulation treatment in the same radiation treatment position. PET-images were coregistered using five fiducial markers. Target delineation was initially performed on CT images and the corresponding PET data were subsequently used as an overlay to CT data to define the target volume. FDG-PET identified previously undetected distant metastatic disease in 2 patients, making them ineligible for curative CRT. The Gross Tumor Volume (GTV) was decreased by CT and FDG image fusion in 12 patients (35%) and was increased in 7 patients (20.5%). The GTV reduction was &gt;or=25% in 4 patients due to reduction of the length of the esophageal tumor. The GTV increase was &gt;or=25% with FDG-PET in 2 patients due to the detection of occult mediastinal lymph node involvement in one patient and an increased length of the esophageal tumor in the other patient. Modifications of the GTV affected the planning treatment volume (PTV) in 18 patients. Modifications of delineation of GTV and displacement of the isocenter of PTV by FDG-PET also affected the percentage of total lung volume receiving more than 20 Gy (VL20) in 25 patients (74%), with a dose reduction in 12 patients and a dose increase in 13 patients. In our study, CT and FDG-PET image fusion appeared to have an impact on treatment planning and management of patients with esophageal carcinoma related to modifications of GTV. The impact on treatment outcome remains to be demonstrated. ","1884":"It has been suggested that urethrography used for localization of the prostate apex may cause a systematic cranial displacement of the organ. Our objective was to use CT-CT image registration to identify if a clinically relevant systematic shift occurs in the position of the prostate and seminal vesicles following retrograde urethrography. Patients were scanned twice at the time of simulation. They were imaged supine, bladder empty. Scan resolution was 512x512 with 5 mm cuts. After the first CT sequence, with the patient still on the CT couch, an urethrogram was performed. The patients were then re-scanned. The image sets were registered through the use of external skin fiducials. A single author reviewed x, y and z-axis displacement. Z-axis motion of the prostate was also assessed by having three blinded radiation oncologists mark the cranial limit of the prostate on all 104 image sets. Fifty-two pairs of CT scans were analyzed for post-urethrogram organ displacement. The mean x axis displacement of the prostate was 0.016 mm (P=0.8), the mean y-axis displacement was 1.3 mm anterior (P&lt;0.001). Mean z-axis displacement of the prostate, using the blinded assessments, was a 1.35 mm cranial shift (P&lt;0.0001). Analogous shifts were identified for the seminal vesicles. Our results suggest a small cranial and anterior displacement of the prostate and seminal vesicles following retrograde urethrography. ","1885":"Optimal management of intracranial germinomas remains controversial. Focal irradiation to the primary tumor followed by prophylactic craniospinal radiotherapy represents the traditional treatment resulting in excellent long-term survival but potential late effects. To decrease late effects related to extensive fields of radiotherapy, combined chemotherapy and irradiation has been tested with reduced volumes and doses of radiation therapy. We report our experience about four patients successfully treated by neoadjuvant chemotherapy with carboplatin and etoposide followed by radiotherapy delivering 26 to 36 Gy to the whole brain and 36 to 50 Gy to the initial tumor volume.","1886":"Tumors of salivary glands arise mainly from the parotid gland. Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is mandatory not only to localize precisely the tumor within the gland but also to differentiate between benign and malignant neoplasms, in competition with cytology in fine-needle aspiration biopsy. Tumors without risk of transformation, such as adenolymphoma, are not systematically operated on. Indications of roentgenotherapy and irradiation volumes depend on histologic type, localisation and size of the tumor.","1887":"","1888":"To evaluate retrospectively the anatomical definition of target volumes in the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas of the limbs and to study the radiation dose in the local control and toxicity. Seventy-seven patients were consecutively treated for primary soft tissue sarcoma of the extremity with limb sparing surgery and external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) in the same institution. The median follow up was 56 months (17-89 months). Fifty-two patients (67%) had clear microscopic surgical margin (R0 resection), 23 (30%) had histologically positive microscopic margin (R1 resection), 2 had a macroscopic residual disease (R2 resection). An anatomical definition of target volumes has been realised. The mean dose was 50 Gy in 25 or 28 fractions; 23 patients received a boost restricted to the tumor bed: 13 with EBRT, 10 with brachytherapy (BRT). Thirty-four patients had an adjuvant chemotherapy. The overall 5 year local relapse rate was 10%. Seven local relapses were described, five of the high-grade tumours, and five in patients with positive margin. In univariate analysis, quality of surgery shows a significant effect for local control. By using LENT-SOMA scale for late toxicity, a significant difference was found for neurological complications for patients receiving a boost. The results of the series validate the concept of anatomical definition of the initial target volume. A boost should be realised for positive margin tumors and may be for high-grade tumors. Neurological toxicity must be considered for the evaluation of the prescribed dose. ","1889":"Development and availability of multislice CT modifies quickly procedures for diagnostic and pretherapeutic explorations. This new technology provides many advantages such as: to reduce time of examination and to facilitate exploration of larger anatomical volumes, to reduce partial volume effects, to enhance the ratio signal\/noise, to improve intravascular concentration of contrast product and then to better identify arterial or venous phases. Use of multislice CT for exploration with respiratory gating is also discussed. On the other hand, multislice CT requires new requirements as medical time occupation and handling of important number of images. Active collaboration between radiologists and radiation oncologists is needed to define new acquisition modalities and practical ways of co-interpretation.","1890":"The purpose of this article is to propose a building model to delineate Clinical Target Volume in laryngeal cancers (squamous cell carcinoma). This model uses histological knowledge about the spread of laryngeal cancers. Firstly is described the spread, depending on primary location and anatomic structures. Then illustrated examples on Computed Tomography are provided. This delineation approach appears to be useful with 3D-CRT and IMRT for adapting dose delivery to the complex spread of laryngeal cancer.","1891":null,"1892":"Gliomas are the most frequent tumors of the central nervous system of the adult. These intraparenchymal tumors are infiltrative and the most important criterion for definition of GTV and CTV is the extent of infiltration. Delineation of GTV and CTV for untreated and resected glioma remains a controversial and difficult issue because of the discrepancy between real tumor invasion and that estimated by CT or MRI. Is particularly helpful a joint analysis of the four different methods as histopathological correlations with CT and MRI, use of new modality imaging, pattern of relapses after treatment and interobserver studies. The presence of isolated tumor cells in intact brain, oedema or adjacent structures requires the definition of two different options for CTV: i) a geometrical option with GTV defined as the tumor mass revealed by the contrast-enhanced zone on CT or MRI and a CTV with an expanded margin of 2 or 3 cm; ii) an anatomic option including the entire zone of oedema or isolated tumor cell infiltration extending at least as far as the limits of the hyperintense zone on T2-weighted MRI. Inclusion of adjacent structures (such as white matter, corpus callosum, subarachnoid spaces) in the CTV mainly depends on the site of the tumor and size of the volume is generally enlarged.","1893":"","1894":"Rhabdomyosarcoma of the salivary glands is rare. Tumours develop mostly in children and young patients but can be diagnosed in older people. We report three new cases in women 7, 14 and 75 years old. Tumefaction of the parotid region and facial paralysis were the principle clinical symptoms. Two patients underwent a total parotidectomy and radiotherapy. The third patient had a locally advanced tumour and received chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. Loco-regional recurrence was observed in all cases and median survival was 12 months. Rhabdomyosarcoma of the salivary glands is locally aggressive. Treatments include surgery and radiotherapy. The role of chemotherapy remains to be discussed.","1895":"Primary signet ring cell carcinoma of urinary bladder is a rare tumor; accounting for approximately 0.24% of all bladder malignancies. In this study, we report a case of a 58-year old man who consulted for complaints of gross hematuria, the bladder biopsy showed signet ring cell carcinoma; the exploration of gastrointestinal tract did not reveal any other tumor localizations. A total cystoprostatectomy was performed followed by radiotherapy. The aim of this study is to determine the anatomoclinical, therapy and evolution characteristics of this rare tumor.","1896":"1\/ To evaluate the incidence of hypothyroidism following radiotherapy in the management of breast and nasopharyngeal carcinomas, 2\/ to define the role of a systematic post therapeutic screening. From January 1996 through March 2001 a systematic evaluation of the clinical and the biological thyroid function was performed on a cohort of 84 patients that received supraclavicular irradiation. Selected patients had either a mammary (37 cases) or a nasopharyngeal (47 cases) carcinoma. Initial work up included thyroid inspection and palpation, and biological tests: serum FT4 and TSH levels, radioimmunochemistry, completed by dynamic thyroid stimulation, using TRH, in case of border line low T4 or isolated high TSH levels. Tests were repeated every three months the first year, and then every six months. Replacement therapy with L Thyroxin was administered in case of hypothyroidism. All selected patients had a normal function initially. With a mean two years follow up (1-5 years), 24 patients (29%) experienced hypothyroidism, half of whom (13 cases) being purely biological. Five patients (11%), with a nasopharyngeal carcinoma, presented also with associated pituitary failure. Clinical symptoms were minor or mild in all cases. Hypothyroidism was detected at a mean 21 months follow up. In 2 patients, hypothyroidism disappeared spontaneously within 6 months. Possible predictive factors were evaluated: age of the time of radiation, gender, percentage of irradiated thyroid, total dose, dose per fraction, tumour type and chemotherapy. Only age appeared significantly correlated with thyroid dysfunction (range: 10-30 years, P=0.002). Hypothyroidism is a frequent and certainly underestimated complication following radiotherapy of the neck. In such patients, a systematic clinical and biological evaluation every three months the first year, and then every six months until five years is recommended. ","1897":"The \"Standards, Options and Recommendations\" (SOR) project, started in 1993, is a collaboration between the Federation of French Cancer Centres (FNCLCC), the 20 French regional cancer centres, and specialists from French public universities, general hospitals and private clinics. The main objective is the development of clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of health care and the outcome of cancer patients. The methodology is based on a literature review and critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary group of experts, with feedback from specialists in cancer care delivery. To update the SOR recommendations for the use of radiation therapy in the management of patients with osteosarcoma. This work was performed in collaboration with the French society against cancers in children and adolescent (SFCE). Data have been identified by literature search using Medline (from January 1992 to October 2003). In addition several Internet sites were searched in October 2003. The 3 mains standards are: 1) local and exclusive curative irradiation is not indicated as primary treatment for osteosarcoma or for local and operable recurrence, except for lesion in inaccessible sites or if the patient refuses surgery; 2) local and prophylactic adjuvant irradiation is not indicated for the treatment of osteosarcoma after chemotherapy (neoadjuvant and\/or adjuvant) and complete macro or microscopic surgery, except for non-operable R1 or R2 surgical resection; 3) whole-lung prophylactic irradiation is not indicated in non-metastatic osteosarcoma. Systemic metabolic radiotherapy for pain treatment, using samarium-153 ethylenediaminetetramethylene phosphonic acid (Sm-153-EDTMP) can be offered to patients with painful metastatic osteosarcoma or in case of recurrent bone sites inaccessible to local therapies (surgery, external irradiation). ","1898":"","1899":"We report in this publication three cases of mucous malignant melanoma of the nasal fossae. The nasal mucous malignant melanoma creates a unilateral obstructive and hemorrhagic tumour, readily septal or situated on the external wall of the nasal fossae (inferior and middle turbinates). The diagnosis established by the clinical examination (pigmented forms) is confirmed by the anatomopathological examination--thanks in particular to its tinctorial affinity for Fontana-Masson colouring. The immunohistochemistry reinforces the diagnosis in the presence of any achromic varieties or those simulating an undifferentiated tumour or neurinoma. Modern imagery (CT Scan, IRM) is impossible to circumvent for a precise loco-regional assessment, an essential preliminary to the therapeutic protocol--mainly of radiosurgical type. Chemotherapy (deticene) remains in force in the metastatic forms. Specific therapies are being evaluated (immunological-hormonal therapy). The forecast of the mucous malignant melanoma remains pejorative with a 10 to 40% survival rate of five years. The improvement of the forecast depends on an early diagnosis, an evolutionary locoregional assessment as complete as possible with an adapted and multidisciplinary choice of therapies (surgery, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, hormonal therapy).","1900":"A 61-year-old male patient suffering from squamous cell carcinoma of the lower lip developed pemphigus vulgaris two months after exposure to radiotherapy. Skin lesions were initially localised to the face and neck and later extended over other skin areas. The eruption are improved with glucosteroid therapy, which were stopped after six months. Pemphigus induced by radiotherapy is rare, latency before the onset of the vesiculobullous eruption is variable. Clinical, histological and immunological characteristics are similar to those of other types of pemphigus.","1901":null,"1902":"Local-regional radiation therapy is one of the major therapeutic means in the management of breast cancer. Three questions however arise from the important advances achieved in this domain in the past years. The first question concerns the possibilities to identify and overcome the radioresistance of a subset of tumours. The second question is how to recognize women likely to benefit from adjuvant radiation therapy, and therefore to diminish treatment indications in other groups. Finally, the third question is how to identify subjects at high risk for long term injury following breast irradiation, in order to adapt techniques and indications in such populations. The major advances of breast cancer molecular genetics in the past years should provide clinicians with tools to answer these important questions. In this paper, we review the molecular germline (BRCA1, BRCA2, ATM, ...) and somatic (p53, tyrosine kinase receptors, as well as actors of cell cycle, signal transduction, apoptosis, DNA repair ...) main bases of breast cancer radiosensitivity. Recent methods of exploration of the genetic background of both the host and the tumours (gene and protein expression profiles) are also reviewed as major tools of breast cancer management in the next few years.","1903":"The development of several new anti cancer agents has been made possible because of recent significant achievements in our global understanding of cancer biology. These new \"targeted\" agents selectively inhibit targets necessary for tumor cell growth and viability with little toxicity to normal cells compared to conventional cytotoxic agents. So far, the efficacy of many of these new promising agents when used alone treatment remains limited, it is likely that the optimal use of these agents could be obtained in combination with conventional agents such as radiation therapy. The potential benefit of these targeted therapies combined with irradiation seems important. They might offer the advantage of increasing the tumor response to radiation with no or little increase in normal tissue damage. Therefore, these new types of chemo-radiation approaches might respect the normal tissue versus tumor cell \"therapeutic ratio\". These approaches can be sub divided in three sub groups: 1) Therapeutics targeting selectively one tumor related biochemical activity such as EGFR inhibitors. These approaches are efficient but one mutation of the target might render them inefficient. 2) Therapeutics directed against a widely expressed target. This is the case for anti Insulin Growth Factor-1 (IGF1R) interventions: IGF1R inhibition seems to specifically alter tumor cell viability with a minimal effect on normal cells viability. 3) Strategies which are not targeted against the tumor but the microenvironment, especially angiogenesis. This type of approaches seems to be applicable independently of tumor intrinsic biologic related factors.","1904":"Nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) are very different from other head and neck cancers because of their specific multifactorial etiology and their geographic distribution. Epstein-Barr Virus (EBV) is implicated in oncogenesis of NPC in association with genetic alterations such as inactivation of the p16\/Ink4, p19\/ARF, RASSF1 or Blu genes. Tumoral tissues include a very abundant characteristic lymphoid infiltrate. Inflammatory cytokines are produced by both malignant and infiltrating cells. There is no efficient immune response against the tumor. On the opposite, infiltrating lymphocytes might play a role in tumor development. Serological methods and detection of circulating viral DNA are expected to become useful for early detection of relapse and on a longer term for primary screening. NPC are often diagnosed at a late stage because patients may remain asymptomatic for a long time. Computed tomography (CT scan) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) are complementary for the initial evaluation. Positron emission tomography (PET) is efficient for the evaluation of treatment efficiency and detection of relapses. Treatment is based on radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Their optimal use needs to be evaluated by phase III trials but positive results have been obtained by concomitant association of radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Targeted therapies are being studied with strategies based on disruption of viral latency, use of replicative adenoviruses or anti-tumor vaccination.","1905":"EGFR is overexpressed and is associated with a poor prognosis in head and neck cancer. Among the biological and cellular effects resulting from EGFR targeting in head and neck cancer there is the capacity to restore apoptotic capacities. Other experimental results put into evidence that DNA-repair activity was reduced by the application of EGFR targeting agents. This context was in favor of a research oriented towards combination between anti-EGFR drugs and cytotoxic agents, particularly irradiation. Supra-additive cytotoxic effects have been observed at the experimental level when combining anti-EGFR drugs with irradiation in head and neck cancer. These experimental data were recently confirmed at the clinical level in locally advanced head and neck cancer.","1906":"Intensity-modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) for head and neck (HN) tumors refers to a new approach to the whole treatment procedure from patient immobilization to beam delivery. Implementation of IMRT thus requires knowledge of setup uncertainties, adequate selection and delineation of target volumes based on clinical examination and optimal imaging modalities, appropriate specification and dose prescription regarding dose-volume constraints, and ad hoc quality control of both the clinical and physical aspects of the whole procedure. A large number of issues still need to be resolved and\/or further refined, such as the optimal selection and delineation of the target volume in particular, with the introduction of functional imaging, and a better integration of improved dose distribution into the fractionation strategy. IMRT is associated with a potentially increased incidence of carcinogenesis, although in the HN area this risk is relative to the intrinsic risk of co-morbidity and secondary cancer associated with the patient's lifestyle. Currently, the implementation of IMRT into routine clinical practice for HN cancers may not be a straightforward matter, and should probably be restricted to selected patients and selected institutions with adequate resources and experience. This review emphasizes the above aspects and provides some recommendations for the future use of IMRT in patients with HN tumors.","1907":"Larynx preservation in advanced pharyngolaryngeal cancers has been a major challenge in clinical research over the past two decades. Subtotal surgery (endoscopic laser surgery, supracricoid partial laryngectomies and hemilaryngopharyngectomies) has allowed reducing the indications of the so-called \"mutilating\" surgery. On the other hand, the modification of fractionation has notably improved the results of definitive irradiation (but most probably for supraglottic tumors). The main clinical research has been carried out with either sequential or concurrent chemo-irradiation. Induction chemotherapy followed by irradiation in good responders or by surgery in poor responders allowed to preserve the larynx in around half the cases without deleterious impact on overall survival. Concurrent chemo-irradiation trials suggested that the larynx preservation rates could be increased but overall survival remained unchanged and mucositis was a notable side effect. The next step could be the combination of induction chemotherapy followed by concurrent chemo-irradiation in good responders. Finally, the place of new drugs (taxanes, targeted therapies) is to be explored in this context.","1908":"Carcinoma of the upper aerodigestive tract (oral cavity, oropharynx, hypopharynx, nasopharynx, larynx) are frequent tumors for which surgery and\/or radiotherapy are the main therapeutic agents. The main results of meta-analyses based on the collection of individual patients data are reported: 1) The meta-analysis on chemotherapy, regrouping data of nearly 11,000 patients issued from 63 randomized trials showed an absolute benefit of 4% at five years in overall survival, in favor of chemotherapy (P&lt;0.0001). Most of the benefit was seen with concomitant radiochemotherapy, however with a relatively large heterogeneity in this subgroup of trials. An update of this meta-analysis was performed including 24 additional trials, which confirmed the magnitude of the benefit due to concomitant chemotherapy (8% at 5 years). 2) The meta-analysis on larynx preservation, using induction chemotherapy in larynx and hypopharynx carcinomas. No significant difference was seen between the control arm with total laryngectomy and the larynx preservation approach. 3) The meta-analysis on chemotherapy in nasopharynx carcinomas, from the data of 11 randomized trials including 2722 patients, and comparing the radiotherapy to radio-chemotherapy (1979-2001). The results showed an absolute benefit of 6% at five years in overall survival, in favor of chemotherapy (P&lt;0.0001). Most of the benefit was seen with concomitant radiochemotherapy. 4) Finally, a meta-analysis on altered fractionated RT, compared to conventional RT in 15 randomized trials regrouping 6515 patients. The results showed a small but significant improvement in favor of altered fractionated RT for overall survival and local control with an absolute benefit at five years of 3 and 6%, respectively.","1909":"Oncologic cervicofacial surgery and plastic surgery have had a common evolution over the last 50 years where progress erasing from one was beneficial to the other one. We review here the historical evolution of these specialties and present the state of the art of plastic surgery in the field of cervicofacial oncology.","1910":"Positron emission tomography (PET-scan) is a well-established imaging modality in oncology. Using FDG, PET has also a wide range of applications in head and neck tumors for diagnosis, staging, monitoring of response to therapy, and detection of relapse. After a short technical introduction, the current indications of PET-FDG in head and neck tumors are reviewed. Present and future developments of PET are twofold: the use of new tracers for protein synthesis, cellular proliferation or detection of hypoxia etc., and the introduction of metabolic imaging as a adjunct to CT and MRI to determine target-volumes in radiation treatment planning. However, it has to be emphasized that a thorough clinical validation of the methods used is mandatory before their implementation in routine practice.","1911":"Head and neck carcinomas, i.e. oral cavity, pharynx and larynx cancers, are frequent among men in France. They are mostly squamous-cell carcinomas. The main risk factors are alcohol and tobacco, and their effects are multiplicative. In France, alcohol and tobacco consumptions are decreasing in the male population leading to decrease in head and neck carcinoma incidence and mortality. The best way to prevent head and neck carcinoma is the reduction of alcohol and tobacco consumption.","1912":"Between May 2002 and May 2004, eight French comprehensive cancer centres did a prospective nonrandomized study including 200 patients, 100 with cancer of the prostate and 100 with head and neck cancers. Half of each patient group was treated by IMRT and the others by RTC 3D. This clinical study was associated with an economic study and a physics study. We report here the first results. For the clinical study, the analysis of the data of the first 88 patients irradiated for a prostatic cancer shows that 39 received RTC and 49 IMRT with a mean dose of 78 Gy at the ICRU point at 2 Gy per fraction. For H&amp;N tumours, the preliminary analysis was done on the 87 first patients with a mean follow-up of 11.5 months (2 to 25 months) and a median of 8.4 months for the IMRT groups and 13.2 months for the RTC group. The economic study was done on the first 157 patients included during the first 18 months: 71 treated by RTC (35 for H&amp;N and 36 for prostate) and 86 treated by IMRT (38 for H&amp;N and 48 for prostate). The assessment of the direct costs was realized by a micro-costing technique. The physical study compared dose distributions for both techniques and has created quality control recommendations. Clinical studies of the acute reactions do not show any difference between groups, but we want to point out the short follow-up and the relatively high dose delivered to cancers of the prostate. The physics study demonstrates that IMRT is technically feasible in good clinical conditions with high quality assurance, a good reproducibility and precision. Dosimetric data show that IMRT could certainly spare organs at risk more than RTC for H&amp;N tumours. The direct costs of \"routine\" treatments for H&amp;N tumours were 4922 euros for IMRT versus 1899 euros for RTC and for the prostatic cancers 4911 euros for IMRT versus 2357 for RTC. ","1913":"New drugs aiming at the development of targeted therapies have been assayed in combination with ionizing radiation over the past few years. The rationale of this concept comes from the fact that the cytotoxic potential of targeted drugs is limited, thus requiring concomitant association with a cytotoxic agent for the eradication of tumor cells. Conversely a low level of cumulative toxicity is expected from targeted drugs. Most targeted drugs act through inhibition of post-translational modifications of proteins, such as dimerization of growth factor receptors, prenylation reactions, or phosphorylation of tyrosine or serine-threonine residues. Many systems involving the proteasome, neoangiogenesis promoters, TGF-beta, cyclooxygenase or the transcription factor NF-kappaB, are currently under investigation in hopes they will allow a control of cell proliferation, apoptosis, cell cycle progression, tumor angiogenesis and inflammation. A few drugs have demonstrated an antitumor potential in particular phenotypes. In most instances, however, radiation-drug interactions proved to be strictly additive in terms of cell growth inhibition or induced cell death. Strong potentiation of the response to radiotherapy is expected to require interaction with DNA repair mechanisms.","1914":"Gemcitabine is pyrimidine analog which has demonstrated antitumoral activity in a variety of solid tumors. Laboratory studies demonstrating that gemcitabine is a potent radiosensitizer led to a variety of trials combining radiation and gemcitabine. In the clinic, phase I-II studies are still trying to determine the optimal dose and schedule which could be use in daily clinical practice. This review summarizes the mechanisms of interaction between radiotherapy and gemcitabine and presents several therapeutic schemes for each tumor location.","1915":"Taxanes (paclitaxel and docetaxel) stabilized microtubules against depolymerization, and inhibit their function. Their radiosensitizing properties have been discovered more than 10 years ago; they synchronized tumor cells in G2\/M phase, the most radiosensitive portion of the cell cycle. Other radiosensitizing mechanisms have been also discussed, as reoxygenation, promotion of radio-apoptosis and antiangiogenic cooperation. Many phase I and II studies have been performed, essentially in bronchus and head and neck carcinomas. In lung cancer, paclitaxel was delivered weekly at a dose of 60 mg\/m2. Many studies combined cisplatin or carboplatin with paclitaxel, demonstrating that this combination is feasible and efficient. Only one phase III trial was reported; after two cycles of chemotherapy for inoperable lung cancers, radiotherapy was delivered, with or without paclitaxel radiosensitization: a benefit in disease-free survival was observed for the combination arm. In head and neck carcinomas, conomitant association of cisplatin, paclitaxel and radiation was feasible and showed promising results. Clinical trials with docetaxel are in progress.","1916":"Since its discovery by Rosenberg in 1965, cisplatin and its derivatives have appeared as the most important chemotherapeutic agents, particularly for their radiosensitizing properties and their clinical use with radiation. In spite of numerous preclinical and clinical studies, optimal schedules of platin and radiotherapy combination have to be defined. The first part of this overview will describe biological mechanisms of interaction between radiation therapy and platinum derivatives. The second part will report the major clinical impact of their association.","1917":"Surgery remains the cornerstone treatment for pancreatic adenocarcinoma. However, 5% to 20% of tumors only are regarded as resectable, and, among them, only few benefit from an histological complete resection, major survival parameter. These data explain the overall poor prognosis of this disease, with a respectively 20% and 5% 1- and 5-year survival rates. These results justify an adjuvant or neoadjuvant therapeutic approach, mainly based on concurrent chemoradiation, with and without surgery. This paper reviews the different therapeutic approaches of non metastatic pancreatic adenocarcinoma.","1918":"The resection rate for pancreatic adenocarcinoma is only 10%. Curative resection remains the most important factor determining outcome for resectable pancreatic adenocarcinoma. Since 1990, an improvement on survival rate was observed, but the reasons are unclear: this improvement may be related to a more effective patient selection, more radical resection or adjuvant treatment strategies. The value of more radical resection remains open to debate, despite the negative results of two recent randomized trials with standard versus extended lymphadenectomy. The overall five-year survival rate after resection is still about 10% to 20%; these poor results emphasized the need for a best patient selection, the research of new preoperative prognostic factors, and randomized trials of neoadjuvant or adjuvant treatments.","1919":"The oropharynx includes the base of tongue, tonsil pillars, soft palate, lateral and posterior wall of the hypopharynx. Tumors involving each part of these areas are often treated by external beam radiation therapy. The development of conformal approaches and the implementation of intensity modulated radiation therapy, combined with accurate definition of target volumes, endorsed by the international community, allows to propose guidelines for definition of target volumes. First of all imaging acquisition for dosimetry is reminded. For tumors involving the base of tongue and vallecula, early superficial tumors should be distinguished from tumors involving the muscles, indicating an increased margin defining the clinical target volume around the tumor to 1.5 cm. Tumors developed in the posterior wall of the hypopharynx should include constrictor muscles of the pharynx inside of the CTV. Tonsil carcinomas should be treated with a 1.5 cm margin around the tumor in the three dimensions. In spite of modern imaging, external beam treatment of tumors developed in the soft palate and in palatine arch remains difficult. The high rate of nodal involvement of these tumors and significant rates of bilateral extension have to be taken into consideration. Accurate criteria have been available to integrate a probability of bilateral extension in oropharyngeal tumors. It should be analyzed according to the size of the tumor and the rate of extension in the base of the tongue and in the palatine arch.","1920":"The oropharynx is a complex anatomical area gathering different subsites. Optimal treatment of oropharyngeal carcinoma remains still controversial. In early stages, surgery and radiation therapy are known to provide comparable oncologic results. Till recently, advanced tumors were best treated using primary radical surgery followed by postoperative radiotherapy, but new \"organ sparing\" approaches like concurent chemoradiotherapy seem now able to challenge primary surgery with a better functional outcome. This paper is focused on the role of primary surgery for cancer of the base of tongue and the lateral wall of the oropharynx. The surgical indications and the various surgical approaches are debated including advantages, disadvantages and tumor resections allowed by each of them respectively. Before to be considered, suitable oncologic surgery for oropharyngeal cancer should tackle 5 issues: complete resection of the tumor, adequate exposure, function preservation, minimal morbidity and simplicity of technique. During the past decade, significant advances have been observed in reconstructive surgical procedures through the use of microvascular free flaps routinely, which allows a more functional restoration of surgical defect. Current therapeutic strategy for oropharyngeal carcinoma should be settled not only following disease-free survival results but also the functional outcome of each treatment modality respectively.","1921":"Technical radiotherapy progress drive the practices towards increasingly more precise irradiations. The recent developments of the various imaging methods and specialized software made more controls possible. The fields of investigations relate to the quality assurance of the irradiation, the reproducibility of positioning, the movements evaluations and real time dosimetry. Radiotherapy finds, in the images exploitation, a strong potential in improving quality treatments, however it is conditioned by the implementation of ambitious programs, time consuming, but essential to grant the precision of virtual simulations and the daily practice. If all the existing technical devices and software offer higher tools than the current practices, the recommendations can be limited to the insurance of a sufficient precision and reproducibility of the whole treatments. It is thus fundamental to be able to filter the errors, the systematic deviations and to control the statistics of positioning and movements. Each radiotherapy department must apply an adapted program to each site and exploit the imaging chain to maintain its results.","1922":"ICRP (International Commission for Radiological Protection) Committee 3 (\"Radioprotection in medicine\") is currently finalizing two recommendations about Brachytherapy. The first text, from Task Group (TG) 53, is focussing on the prevention of high-dose-rate brachytherapy accidents. It reminds the reader of the 500 accidents\/incidents which have been reported so far in the literature, and reports in details on some representative accidents. Building on those data, the text gives general and specific recommendations, aiming at reducing both the frequency and the severity of those accidents. The second text, from Task Group 57, considers the radiation safety aspects of brachytherapy for prostate cancer using permanently implanted sources. For this topic, no severe accident has never been reported so far. However, some radioprotection problems arose, due to the dose received from the patients, to migrating seeds and to cremation. The text presents recommendations specifically addressing those issues.","1923":"The EQUAL-ESTRO laboratory was set up in 1998 to perform external audits of radiotherapy beams for all the European centres. Until the end of the year 2003, it was funded by EC projects. The external quality control is based on measurements performed with thermoluminescent dosimeters (TLD) sent by postal mail to the participating centre in order to be irradiated on axis in reference conditions and in conditions close to clinical conditions for photon and electron beams. The EQUAL-ESTRO laboratory also started in 2002, a new TLD control allowed to check the dosimetry of complex clinical fields for photon beams with multileaf collimator (MLC). New geometric and dosimetric checks have also been developed for brachytherapy. The participating centre irradiates TLDs (7LiF: Na, mg, Ti, TLD 937 [Philitec]) in water at a dose of 2 Gy, calculated with the TPS used clinically, following the EQUAL-ESTRO protocol. Since the beginning of the activities, 46% of the French radiotherapy centres and 55% of the European radiotherapy centres applied to participate to the EQUAL quality control programme. In France, the EQUAL-ESTRO laboratory checked, from 1998 and June 2004, 283 photon beams, 180 electron beams and 61 photon beams with MLC. For all the French beams checks, the following results have been observed: for the photon beams, the results show that about 1% of the measured doses in the reference conditions on axis have been detected outside the tolerance level (deviation between the measured dose and the stated dose &gt; +\/- 5%) after a first or a second check. For points checked in photon beams with wedge filter, 2.5% of the beams checked show a deviation &gt; +\/- 5% after a first or a second check. For the electron beams, the check has been set up in January 1999. For the 180 electron beams checked, 5% of the measured doses in the reference conditions have been found outside the tolerance level (&gt; +\/- 5%). These results show clearly the importance of the quality control in radiotherapy in the frame of an external audit. This audit should now be a part of a quality assurance programme in the radiotherapy centres in addition to the internal quality control as planned in the French law (02\/03\/2004) concerning the external quality control conditions of the radiotherapy treatment units. ","1924":"The IAEA\/WHO TLD programme has been in operation for 34 years. In this period the calibration of approximately 5200 high-energy photon beams in over 1300 radiotherapy hospitals in 115 countries worldwide was checked. Of these, 18% of the audits were performed in Eastern and South-Eastern Europe. There are large contrasts in the region; while the results are very good for most countries, a few countries struggle with basic problems in dosimetry. The hospitals operating radiotherapy services without qualified medical physicists or dosimetry equipment have poorer results than those properly equipped and staffed. Only about 2\/3 of TLD audit participants in Eastern Europe have the appropriate dosimetry equipment. To achieve consistency of the audit results within Eastern and South-Eastern Europe, strengthening of radiotherapy infrastructure in a few countries would be necessary.","1925":"The coregistration of planning CT and 18F-fluoro-deoxy-2-glucose (FDG) positron emission tomography (PET) with patient in the same treatment position is the principally well-established tool for improving the target coverage defined and the target planning volume to treat the metabolic target volume. Most of the interest in the coresgistred CT\/PET images on volume delineation has focused on conformal radiation therapy of non-small cell lung cancer. In spite of technical difficulties related to the target volume displacements, and the sensitivity and the specificity of FDG-PET images &lt; 100%, the target volume delineation is significantly changed by the coregistration of FDG-PET images and planning CT by either reduction of the radiation volume (excluding atelectasis or mediastinal lymph node) or the increasing of mediastinal lymph node involvement. Image fusion technique reduces the interobserver variability in target volume delineation. Furthermore, after induction chemotherapy image fusion leads to improve the patient management by detecting locoregional progression disease or the presence of metastatic disease. Other anatomic tumor sites are going to investigate such as: head-and-neck cancer, gynecologic cancer, oesophageal cancer, anal cancer, Hodgkin's disease, and non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. The impact on treatment outcome remains to be demonstrated.","1926":"The question of larynx preservation is central in the management of patients with a carcinoma of the larynx or hypopharynx, especially to preserve the main functions of the larynx. In early stages (T1-earlyT2) Larynx preservation can generally be obtained with partial surgery or radiotherapy. Some other approaches such as exclusive chemotherapy require further investigations. In locally advanced and infiltrating larynx\/hypopharynx carcinomas, (advancedT2-T3), several ways have been used to preserve the larynx including exclusive radiotherapy which can be improved by modified fractionation and acceleration. The efficacy of radiotherapy can be also markedly increased by adding concomitant cisplatin based chemotherapy, as reported recently in a large randomized trial. An alternative approach consisted in using induction chemotherapy (cisplatin-5FU) and followed by a local treatment adapted to the response to chemotherapy. The combined analysis of 3 such randomized trials (GETTEC, Veteran et EORTC) showed that this approach has to be used with caution, and could be safer in good responders to induction chemotherapy. Finally, larynx preservation is generally not proposed in patients with deeply infiltrating tumors and or tumor invading the cartilage or soft tissue in the neck (T4).","1927":"Anaemia is frequent in cancer and may increase tumour hypoxia that stimulates angiogenesis. However, erythropoietin is a hypoxia-inducible stimulator of erythropoiesis which seems to improve quality of life in cancer patients. Two recent phase III randomized studies showed negative results using erythropoietin in head and neck cancer patients and in metastatic breast cancer patients with impaired specific survival. In vitro and in vivo experiments have provided erythropoietin-receptor expression in endothelial cancer cells including malignant tumours of the breast, prostate, cervix, lung, head and neck, ovary, melanoma, stomach, gut, kidney etc. Biologic effect of erythropoietin and its receptor linkage induces proliferation of human breast cancer and angiogenesis and may limit anti-tumour effect of cancer treatment, in part, by tumour vascularization improvement. In addition, the use of exogenous erythropoietin could be able to favour tumour progression by improving tumour oxygenation and nutriment supply. If erythropoietin receptor were functional in human cancer, the assessment of erythropoietin receptor expression on tumour cell may help to select patients benefiting from exogenous erythropoietin. However, the relationship between erythropoietin receptor expression, tumour growth and exogenous erythropoietin, requires more studies. The results of recent clinical trials suggest that using erythropoietin should be avoided in non-anemic patients and discussed in patients receiving curative therapy.","1928":"External beam radiation therapy has changed dramatically during the past decade. Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy (IMRT) represents one of the most important technical advances. IMRT allows dose escalation with potential improvement in local control and less toxicity to normal tissues. It's also a radical change in practice for the physicist but particularly for the radiation oncologist. In this article, we have been described the physical and technical principles of IMRT. Indications are reviewed and aiming to summarize the published data. At last, importance of rigorous and reproducible quality assurance procedures should be emphasized and reminded. The potential clinical applications of IMRT are broad and continue to expand but enthusiasm for IMRT does not have to mask reality. Undesired or even potentially dangerous results may occur and no clinical data are currently available to support its use. More long term data and prospective controlled trials are required to confirm the clinical benefits of IMRT.","1929":"Salivary duct carcinomas are scarce tumour developed mainly in the male in the 6th or 7th decades of their life. Authors report two new cases developed 43 and 60 years-old in females. Because this tumour was localised, a radical treatment associating surgery and radiotherapy was performed. Follow-up were 115 and 137 months, and the two patients remain free of disease. These two cases were opportunity to discuss literature data.","1930":"EGF-receptor (EGFR) is a transmembrane protein, which was implicated in the progression of many epithelial cancer types. Its activation induce some transduction pathways inside the cell, and contribute to many cellular processes as cell proliferation, inhibition of apoptosis and angiogenesis. Monoclonal antibodies directed against EGFR or small molecules inhibiting its tyrosine-kinase function could block all these pathways. By modulating these cellular functions, these molecules enhance the antitumor activity of ionizing radiation. Several mechanisms have been discussed (alteration od DNA damage repair, facilitation of apoptosis, inhibition of tumour repopulation) and justify the current clinical trials combining these drugs and radiotherapy.","1931":"Head and neck tumors represent very interesting targets for IMRT techniques because of the complex shape of the structures and the organs at risk close by. The use of this kind of techniques requires a quality assurance protocol. The physicists of the GORTEC group shared their experience to define some recommendations in order to draw up a QA protocol. The dosimetric verification of the treatment plans (in terms of absolute and relative dose), the control of the reproducibility of the patient positioning and the use of a record and verify system to control the different parameters form the main parts of these recommendations. Each chapter comprises a description of the different methods, recommendations concerning the equipment, the adopted tolerances, the frequency of controls. At the end of each chapter, a table summarizes the main actions to carry out. These recommendations will allow to harmonize our practices whatever the softwares and the accelerator that are being used. They will simplify the task of the teams that wish to implement IMRT for head and neck tumors.","1932":null,"1933":null,"1934":"Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is based on a methodology called inverse planning. Starting from dosimetric objectives, constraints of optimization are fixed and given to the inverse planning system, which in turn calculates the modulated intensity to apply to each beam. Since the algorithms allow the constraints to be violated, the results of optimization may differ from the initial dosimetric objectives. Consequently, the user is compelled to adapt the choice of the constraints according to the type of modulation and until satisfactory results are found. The purpose of this work is to present our experience in the choice of these constraints for prostate cancer treatments, as we moved from conformal radiotherapy to IMRT. Treatments were performed with a Varian 23EX linac and calculations were realized with the Varian CadPlan-Helios planning system. The approach used for the first 12 patients treated at institut Curie with IMRT from June 2002 was analysed. The treatment always consisted of a combination of conformal radiotherapy with and without intensity modulation. Results showed that, a larger fraction of the treatment performed with IMRT induced a better sparing of the organs at risk for the same homogeneous dose distribution to the target volume. Apart from the dose-volume constraint for the rectum, a fixed set of constraints, slightly more restrictive than the dosimetric objectives, could be used for all patients. Compared with conformal radiotherapy, the conformation factor for IMRT increased up to 16%. A specific study was undertaken in view of treatments completely performed with IMRT. The optimal technique consisted in performing separated IMRT plans for the two target volumes, the prostate volume and the prostate plus seminal vesicles volume respectively. Another satisfactory possibility was to define new constraints on two separated planning target volumes, prostate and seminal vesicles. This last approach is now routinely implemented for our IMRT patients. ","1935":"\"The Standards, Options and Recommendations\" (SOR) project, started in 1993, is a collaboration between the Federation of French Cancer Centers (FNCLCC), the 20 French regional cancer centers, and specialists from French Public Universities, General Hospitals and Private Clinics. The main objective is the development of clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of health care and the outcome of cancer patients. To elaborate clinical practice guidelines for patients with stomach adenocarcinoma. These recommendations cover the diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of these tumors. The methodology is based on a literature review and critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary group of experts, with feedback from specialists in cancer care delivery. The Standards, Options and Recommendations are thus based on the best available evidence and expert agreement. Adjuvant radiation therapy alone is not a standard treatment for patients with stomach adenocarcinoma. Adjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy is not a standard treatment for patients with stage II or III stomach adenocarcinoma R0, with Dl or D2 lymphadenectomy who have undergone surgery. Following surgical resection, adjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy should be proposed to patients without denutrition with a lymphadenectomy &lt; Dl (fewer than 15 lymph nodes examined) and those with T3 and\/or N+ tumours following the protocol used in the MacDonald trials (SWOG-9008) (Level of evidence B1). Adjuvant concomitant chemoradiotherapy can be administered to patients without denutrition with DI or D2 lymphadenectomy and with involvement of regional lymph nodes (N2 or N3). ","1936":"NF-kappaB (Nuclear Factor-kappaB) was described for the first time in 1986 as a nuclear protein binding to the kappa immunoglobulin-light chain enhancer. Since then, NF-kappaB has emerged as an ubiquitous factor involved in the regulation of numerous important processes as diverse as immune and inflammatory responses, apoptosis and cell proliferation. These last two properties explain the implication of NF-kappaB in the tumorigenic process as well as the promise of a targeted therapeutic intervention. This review focuses on the current knowledge on NF-kappaB regulation and discusses the therapeutic potential of targeting NF-kappaB in cancer in particular during radiotherapy.","1937":"The aim of this work was to establish the acquisition, calculation and 3D compensator manufacturing optimum parameters. This methodology is based on virtual simulation and 3D dosimetry. The material used is a helicoidal CT (PQ 5000-Marconi), a virtual simulation system (AcQsim version 4-Marconi), a Treatment Planning System (Dosigray), a linear accelerator Saturne 43 (Varian, CGR), an automated milling system for compensator filters (Autimo 2.5 D-HEK), a water tank phantom (wellhofer) and an homogeneous phantom with simple patterns in order to simulate the obliquity surface of patient body. The compensator was composed by granulate tin because this material ensures a good profile modulation. The compensation plane has been calculated at 80% to dose profile. The compensator thickness profile has been calculated with different acquisition (slice thickness, pitch factor), calculation (attenuation coefficient, bixel) and fabrication parameters (drill diameter, specification of milling system). After this preliminary study, we have defined the optimum parameters for the compensator realization. We have observed that the slice thickness, bixel size and drill diameter are the parameters that mainly affect the profiles homogeneity. The choice of parameters with smaller dimensions S = 3 mm; B = 3 mm, F = 3 mm, improve the profiles homogeneity. Though, for manufacture times compatible with the clinical routine, the selected parameters are S = 5 mm, B = 6 mm and F = 6 mm. Compensator can be used for any type of Linac. However, one must pay attention on their realization and their positioning on the beam central axis. ","1938":"To investigate the reduction of irradiated small bowel volume with intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) planning in rectal cancer and to asses the variability of the irradiated small bowel in the conventional planning as in the IMRT planning (IMPlan) by obtaining weekly CT scans. Twelve patients with rectal cancer had treatment planning CT scans of the pelvis with small bowel contrast obtained for planning and once a week during treatment (65 CT scans total). The scans were registered using the bony structures. The clinical target volume (CTV), small bowel, large bowel and bladder were outlined on each slice. The first CT scan was used for IMPlan and conventional three-field planning (ConPlan), which were then applied to the CT scans obtained during therapy. The median value among patients of the mean volume over a patient's scan of small bowel irradiated &gt; or =95% was 112 cm3 (standard deviation (SD): 31 cm3) for the ConPlan and 42 cm3 (SD: 17 cm3) for the IMPlan. The median total bladder volume was 148 cm3 (SD: 130 cm3). There was a good correlation between the volume of irradiated small bowel and the bladder volume for IMPlan with &lt;50 cm3 irradiated small bowel and ConPlan with &lt;150 cm3 (p = 0.002). The use of IMRT led to a potentially clinically meaningful reduction in the volume of small bowel irradiated, even when accounting for small bowel motion. A full bladder was of greatest benefit in individuals with the smallest volume of small bowel in the treatment field. ","1939":"Early glottic carcinomas can be treated with radiotherapy or surgery with similar local control rates but with better functional results with radiotherapy. The aim of this study was to analyze the results of our experience of exclusive radiotherapy. From 1975 to 2001, 155 patients with Tis, T1 and T2 glottic carcinomas were treated with exclusive radiotherapy. Prognostic factors of survival, local control and larynx-preservation rates were analyzed in uni and multivariate analyses. Median prescribed dose was 65 Gy in 44 days. Overall survival was 75% for the whole group, 75% for Tis, 85% for T1a, 72% for T1b, 59% for T2. Specific survival was 88% for the whole group, 75% for Tis, 94% for T1a, 90% for T1b, 69% for T2. Disease-free survival was 68% for the whole group, 75% for Tis, 77% for T1a, 51% for T1b, 58% for T2. Laryngeal preservation rate was 85% (133\/155). Twenty-nine (29\/155, 18%) patients developed a local relapse within 31 months. Out of the 10\/86 (12%) T1a-Tis relapses, 7\/10 patients underwent total laryngectomy and 79\/86 larynx were preserved (92%). Out of the 8\/22 (36%) T1b relapses, 4\/8 patients underwent total laryngectomy. Out of the 11\/47 (23%) T2 relapses, 8\/11 patients underwent total laryngectomy. Increased overall treatment time, tumor stage, sub-glottis extension were associated with poorer local control. Second malignancies remain a major problem in the outcome of this population. Radiotherapy remains an efficient option in the treatment of early glottic carcinomas providing a high local control rate with excellent functional results in laryngectomy-free patients. This strategy should be discussed according to the tumor stage, feasibility of conservative surgery and patient's preferences. ","1940":"To analyse the management and clinical outcome of patients treated for a first isolated local recurrence of soft tissue sarcoma (trunk or extremities) and to identify prognosis factors. This is a retrospective study of 83 adult patients treated between 1980 and 1999. Mean tumor size was 6 cm. Most sarcomas were located in extremities (N =74), were deep (N =60), and proximal (N =53). Thirty involved nerves or vessels. Histologic subtypes were mainly grade 2 (42%) or 3 (36%) histocytofibrosarcomas (49%) and liposarcomas (20%). Surgical treatment of recurrences consisted in wide excision (32 cases), marginal resection (46 cases), five patients requiring amputation. Final results were R0 (N =33), R1 (N =47) or R2 (N =3) resection. Beside surgery, six patients received neoadjuvant and seven others adjuvant chemotherapy. Twenty-three patients received postoperative external beam radiotherapy (EBRT) (mean dose 55 Gy) and 26 interstitial (192)Ir low dose rate brachytherapy (BCT) (mean dose 45 Gy for BCT alone, 22 Gy when associated with EBRT), 19 patients being re-irradiated. Mean follow up was 59 months. Thirty-seven (45%) tumors relapsed, 62% locally as first event. Nineteen patients developed secondary distant metastases. Multivariate analysis showed only tumour depth (P =0.05) and re-resection for primary R1 resection for the recurrence (P =0.018) being independent prognosis factors for tumour control, radiotherapy (EBRT and\/or BCT) being significant in univariate analysis (P =0.05). Overall survival rate was 73, 54, and 47% at respectively 3, 5 and 10 years, and was 65, 35 and 32% after a further local recurrence. Multivariate analysis showed trunk (P =0.0001) or inferior extremity locations (P =0.023), symptomatic (P =0.001), high grade (P =0.01), deep (P = 0.01) tumours, and the occurrence of a further local failure (P =0.004) as unfavourable characteristics for overall survival. Because of the high relapse rate in this series, a first isolated local recurrence of STS increases mainly the risk of a subsequent local relapse. Quality of local treatment for the first local relapse is decisive. When a conservative treatment is feasible, it should combine surgical resection and radiotherapy, brachytherapy being the best suited in previously irradiated patients. Efforts have to be pursued to increase quality of the treatment of primary tumours, at best performed in centers that have expertise in this field. ","1941":"","1942":"","1943":"Occurrence of basal cell carcinoma (BCC) following radiotherapy for tinea capitis is well known. The aim of this study was to specify the clinical and histological features of these BCC seen in 33 patients (1995-2000). Twenty seven men and six women were diagnosed with BCC. The age of onset varied between 32 an 62 years. Radiotherapy was received between 5 and 17 years of age. The interval between irradiation and the onset of carcinoma varied between 21 and 51 years. Total number of lesions was 55. Forty percent of BCC occurred on the occipital area, the number varied from 1 to 5 and the size from 2 to 45 mm. Clinically, the nodular type was found in 51% of cases. Pigment was present in 64% of cases. Histological study showed a nodular aspect in 76% and pigmentation in 63% of cases. Nodular and pigmented type were the predominant BCC occurring after radiotherapy for tinea capitis in our series. In the literature, BCC are the most frequent carcinomas occurring after radiotherapy (70-100%). Pigmentation was not described in other series. The nodular histological form was the most frequent.","1944":"The dystrophic form of hereditary epidermolysis bullosa is associated with an increased frequency of squamous cell carcinoma. We report a new case. An 18-year-old patient, carrying a Hallopeau Siemens hereditary epidermolysis bullosa, presented a subcutaneous nodular lesion, for 1 year that ulcerated and budded with inguinal lymphadenopathy. The histological study led to the conclusion of a well differentiated squamous cell carcinoma. The patient was treated surgically. Tumor and metastatic lymph nodes were excised. A radiotherapy was decided but the postoperative course was fatal due to an infection and to a deterioration of her general condition. Squamous cell carcinoma frequently occurs on the cicatricial lesion of hereditary epidermolysis bullosa and usually affects males with recessive hereditary epidermolysis bullosa. Metastases are frequent, precocious and multiple. The treatment may be surgical. The particularities of our observation are the young age of patient and the localization.","1945":"We report on a squamous cell carcinoma of the tongue in a 20-year-old woman with co-infection of the tumor with human papilloma virus type 18 and Epstein-Barr virus. To our knowledge, this is the first case of co-infection in carcinoma of the tongue to be reported. We review the present data and theories concerning viral oncogenesis of oral carcinomas.","1946":"External postoperative radiation therapy for retroperitoneal sarcoma is an example of treatment using large fields for complex shaped volumes of irradiation. Prescribed dose is limited by tolerance of adjacent organs at risk (OAR). From a recent case treated by conventional conformal radiotherapy (3D-CRT), we evaluate the benefit of five theoretical IMRT plans. Criteria used are calculated from DVH related to delineated PTV and OAR. IMRT should permit to enhance the prescribed dose without increasing dose in the OAR (especially residual kidney, spinal cord and small bowel). This theoretical study show the feasibility of a dose escalation from a treatment dose of 45 Gy delivered by 3D-CRT up to a planning dose of 54 Gy calculated by IMRT with: for the PTV: an improvement of the dose homogeneity about 5% (range 2-6%) and moreover the coverage factor (CF) about 13% (range 9-16%); for the OAR: an improvement of the protection factor (PF) about 20% (range 11-24%); and thus an improved conformity index (CI = CF x PF) about 25% (range 15-32%).","1947":"Since many years, Brachytherapy (BT) appears to play an important role in the treatment of many solid tumors. For breast cancer, BT is usually used as boost after postoperative external beam radiation therapy. In certain circumstances, BT can be used as sole radiation technique focalized on the tumor bed or more rarely, as second conservative treatment in case of local recurrence for woman refusing salvage mastectomy. Boost BT is most often applied via an interstitial technique while the dose rate can vary from low to high dose rate through pulse dose rate. All of those boost techniques were published and some of them compared the results obtained with BT and external beam electron therapy. The analysis of the published phase II and III trials was not able to show significant differences between the two boost techniques in term of local control as well as late skin side effects. However, we noted that the patients who received BT boost presented a higher risk of local recurrence compare to those treated with electron therapy, due to age, margin status or presence of extensive intraductal component. Only a phase III trial randomizing BT boost vs electron therapy boost could show a possible improvement of local control rate in the BT arm; however, this trial should enroll patients with a real high risk of local recurrence in order to take benefit from the dosimetric advantages of BT.","1948":"Constraint definitions in intensity modulated radiation therapy is a key point factor during the treatment planning process. In literature some data are available about dose constraints and volumes according to the tissue architectures. Following ICRU recommendations, organs at risk organized in a parallel structure could receive an acceptably small proportion of high dose component. Mean dose and dose volume histogram is a most convenient tool for incorporating such constraints. Organs described as a serial structure are supposed to receive less than the given maximum dose, directly linked to the occurrence of complications. Dmax is the best way to describe such events. These constraints are new tools in radiation therapy, available for optimizing the dose distribution in target volume, sparing the organs at risk to protect the organ function or at least decreasing the late functional damages like xerostomia. It is necessary to define with accuracy gross target volumes and clinical target volume with available radio-anatomical guidelines before introducing current constraints on each volume in the inverse dosimetry. The management of these constraints remains under the responsibility of the clinicians. A permanent compromise has to be chosen between homogeneity of the dose distribution in the target volume and the probability of preserving functions of organs at risk.","1949":"To evaluate the influence of skull base bone (SBB) abnormality showed by MRI on prognosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC). From March 1993 to December 1998, 122 NPC patients received prime radiotherapy treatment. All of them were proved pathologically and checked by magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Every patient received radiation through conjoint facio-cervical field and conventional dose-fractionation schedules. The total dose to the primary tumor was 60-75 Gy (median, 70 Gy). The Kaplan-Meier method, the Log-rank test and the Cox regression model were used to evaluate the significance of prognostic factors on NPC patient survival. The overall median survival period was 50 (6-92) months, and the 1, 3 and 5 year-survival rates were, respectively, 99.2%, 87.9%, and 73.3%. The 1, 3, and 5 year-survival rates of abnormality and normality of the SBB on MRI were 98.9%, 87.2%, 71.9%, and 100.0%, 89.8%, 77.0%, respectively (P = 0.4233). Gender, age, head pain, SBB abnormality, cranial nerve palsy, cervical lymphadenopathy and primary tumor extent were analyzed with the Cox regression model and SBB abnormality on MRI did not prove to have statistical significance (P = 0.6934). According to the analysis of regrouping, patients with SBB abnormalities &gt; or =2 sites have a worse prognosis (P = 0.0427). Then, the above seven factors are analyzed by Cox regression model and the result had statistical significance (P = 0.0385). The SBB abnormality on MRI is of no obvious influence on prognosis of NPC. However, when SBB abnormality sites were &gt; or =2, there is obvious statistical significance on the prognosis. ","1950":"Many observations on potential inadequate coverage of tumour volume at risk in advanced cervical cancer (CC) when conventional radiation fields are used, have further substantiated by investigators using MRI, CT or lymphangiographic imaging. This work tries to obtain three dimensional margins by observing enlarged nodes in CT scans in order to improve pelvic nodal chains clinical target volumes (CTVs) drawing, and by looking for corroborative evidence in the literature for a better delineation of tumour CTV. Eleven consecutive patients (seven males, four females, mean age 62 years, range 43-78) with CT diagnosis of nodal involvement caused by pathologically proved carcinoma of the cervix (n = 2), carcinoma of the rectum (n = 2), carcinoma of the prostate (n = 2), non-Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 2), Hodgkin lymphoma (n = 1), carcinoma of the penis (n = 1) and carcinoma of the corpus uteri (n = 1) were retrospectively reviewed. Sixty CT scans with 67 enlarged pelvic nodes were reviewed in order to record the more proximal structures (muscle, bone, vessels, cutis or subcutis and other organs) to each enlarged node or group of nodes according to the four surfaces (anterior, lateral, posterior and medial) in a clockwise direction. A summary of the observations of each nodal chain and the number of occurrences of every marginal structure on axial CT slices is presented. Finally, simple guidelines are proposed. Tumour CTV should be based on individual tumour anatomy-mainly for lateral beams as it results from sagittal T2 weighted MRI images. Boundaries of pelvic nodes CTVs can be derived from observations of enlarged lymph nodes in CT scans. ","1951":"Margin status is regarded as a major prognostic factor for local recurrence after breast conservative treatment. Margin definition in the literature is not always clear and precise. The impact on the therapeutic management may be quite different. This paper presents the radiotherapeutic attitude according to a survey realized in the twenty French cancer centers. The surgical practice in terms of margins status is appraised. The radiotherapist attitude in terms of boost's modulation is specified.","1952":"To study the number of migrating seeds, the anatomical site of migration and possible predictive parameters of migration, after prostate cancer brachytherapy using a loose-seed (I125) implantation technique. The charts of the 170 patients consecutively treated by the Institut Curie\/Hospital Cochin\/Hospital Necker Group between September 1, 2001 and August 31, 2002, were analysed. All seeds having migrated to the lungs and seen on the chest X-ray systematically performed at 2 months, have been recorded, as well as the seeds lost by the urines (after sieving) or in the sperm (condom). Among 12,179 implanted seeds, 44 were found to have migrated (0.36%). Most of the migrating seeds (32\/44; 73%), were found in the lungs. Overall, one or several seed migrations were observed in 35 patients (21% of the total number of patients in this series). In the majority of cases (77%), only one seed migrated. A significant relationship (P = 0.04) was found between the number of migrating seeds and the number of implanted ones (or with the prostate volume, but those two parameters were closely linked in our series). More specifically, a significant relationship (P = 0.02) could be demonstrated between the number of seeds implanted at the periphery of the prostate and the number of seeds migrating to the lungs. The percentage of migrating seeds observed in this series is low, actually one of the lowest found in the literature when using the loose-seed technique. There was no clinical consequences and the loss of-usually-only one seed is very unlikely to alter the quality of the dose distribution. However, the predominance of pulmonary migrations in our series led us to slightly modify our implantation technique. We now try to avoid too \"peripheral\" seed implantations, due to the risk of migration towards the periprostatic veins, and subsequently to the lungs.

The main objective is the development of clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of health care and the outcome of cancer patients. The methodology is based on a literature review and critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary group of experts, with feedback from specialists in cancer care delivery. To update the Standards, Options and Recommendations clinical practice guidelines for the use of recombinant erythropoietin (epoietin alpha and beta darbepoietin-alpha, EPO) in the management of anaemia in oncology for patient undergoing radiotherapy. The working group identified the questions requiring up-dating from the previous guideline. Medline and Embase were searched using specific search strategies from January 1999 to October 2002. Literature monitoring was performed to identify randomised clinical trials published between October 2002 to November 2003. In addition several Internet sites were searched in October 2002. There is no standard attitude for use of rHuEPO in patients undergoing radiotherapy. There is no evidence to support use of rHuEPO in patients with ENT cancer receiving radiotherapy alone. In patients undergoing curative radiotherapy, it is recommended to correct anaemia under I Og\/dL using transfusion rather than rHuEPO. When the haemoglobin concentration is between 12g\/dL and 14g\/dL initial use of rHuEPO can be an option under certain conditions for radiochemotherapy if the risk of anaemia is high with the chemotherapy regimen used. Anaemic patients should be included in clinical trials to clarify the impact of rHuEPO in terms of local control of the tumour and survival. ","1954":"Combining radiation and hormone therapy has become common clinical practice in recent years for locally advanced prostate cancer. The use of such concomitant therapy in the treatment of breast disease has been very infrequently reported in the literature, but such an application seems justified given the common hormonal dependence of breast cancer and the potential synergetic effect of these two treatment modalities. As adjuvant therapy, tamoxifen is the key drug in the hormonal treatment arsenal, providing a significant improvement in both local control and global survival rates. Aromatase inhibitors are currently being evaluated in this setting, and initial results are promising. In vitro, tamoxifen does not seem to offer a protective effect against radiation. In clinical use, the few available published studies confirm the superiority of the association of radiation with tamoxifen as opposed to radiation therapy alone in decreasing local recurrences of surgically removed breast tumors. Toxicity associated with such concomitant therapy includes mainly subcutaneous and pulmonary fibroses. However, subcutaneous fibrosis and its cosmetic impact on the treated breast are frequently described side effects of radiation therapy, and their incidence may actually be reduced when tamoxifen is associated. The evidence is less controversial for pulmonary fibrosis, which is more common with the concomitant therapy. The association of radiation and aromatase inhibitors has as of yet rarely been reported. Letrozole (Femara) has a radiosensitizing effect on breast-cancer cell lines transfected with the aromatase gene. Clinical data assessing this effect in vivo are not available. The FEMTABIG study (letrozole vs. tamoxifen vs. sequential treatment) did not specify the sequence of radiation and hormonal therapy. The ATAC study comparing the adjuvant use of anastrozole (Arimidex) and tamoxifen does not provide any information on the number of patients receiving radiation concomitant with the hormonal treatment, and in addition also does not specify the sequence of radiation and hormonal treatment. The TEAM study compared exemestane (Aromasine) and tamoxifen, but specified that hormonal treatment follow the completion of radiation therapy.","1955":"Retrospective analysis of patients treated by preoperative brachytherapy for endometrial carcinoma. From 1973 to 1994, 780 consecutive patients with a clinical stage I-II endometrial carcinoma were treated with brachytherapy followed by surgery and pelvic irradiation if necessary. Tumour was staged according to 1979 UICC classification. There were 462 T1a, 257 T1b, and 61 T2, 62% were well differentiated. Brachytherapy consisted in one low dose rate endocavitary application. Sixty grays were delivered on the reference isodose. Surgery consisted in a TAH\/BSO (Piver II) and was performed 6 weeks later. Nodal pelvic irradiation was indicated in case of unfavourable pathological prognostic factors. Median follow up was 122 months. Five year survival rates were: 84% for overall survival, 86% for survival without recurrence, 92.8% for local control, and 3.8% for late complications. Pronostic factors were age, stage, differentiation, grade and postoperative extension. Multivariate analysis showed only age, differentiation and postoperative extension to be independent prognostic factors. If for stage 1, initial surgery has now replaced preoperative brachytherapy in most cases because it allows to identify initial prognostic factors, preoperative brachytherapy remains the most interesting option for stage 2 endometrial carcinomas.

Between December 1991 and October 2001, 42 patients (pts) with bulky cervical carcinomas stage IB2 (11 pts), IIA (15 pts), and IIB (16 pts) with 1\/3 proximal parametrial invasion. Median age was 45 years (range: 24-75 years) and clinical median cervical tumour size was 5 cm (range: 4.1-8 cm). A clinical pelvic lymph node involvement has been observed in 10 pts. All patients underwent preoperative external beam pelvic radiation therapy (EBPRT) and concomitant chemotherapy during the first and the fourth radiation weeks combining 5-fluorouracil and cisplatin. The pelvic dose was 40.50 Gy over 4.5 weeks. EBPRT was followed by low-dose-rate uterovaginal brachytherapy with a total dose of 20 Gy in 17 pts. After a rest period of 5-6 weeks, all pts underwent class II modified radical hysterectomy with bilateral lymphadenectomy. Para-aortic lymphadenectomy was performed in eight pts without pathologic para-aortic lymph node involvement. Twenty-one of 25 pts who had not received preoperative uterovaginal brachytherapy underwent postoperative low-dose-rate vaginal brachytherapy of 20 Gy. The median follow-up was 31 months (range: 3-123 months). Pathologic residual tumour or lymph node involvement was observed in 23 pts. Among the 22 pts with pathologic residual cervical tumour (&lt;0.5 cm: nine pts; &gt;or=0.5 to &lt;or=1 cm: three pts; &gt;1 cm: 10 pts), seven underwent preoperative EBRT followed by uterovaginal brachytherapy vs. 15 treated with preoperative EBRT alone (P = 0.23). Four pts had pathologic lymph node involvement, three pts had vaginal residual tumour, and four pts had pathologic parametrial invasion. The 2- and 5-year overall survival rates were 85% and 74%, respectively. The 2- and 5-year disease-free survival (DFS) rates were 80% and 71%, respectively. After multivariate analysis, the pathologic residual cervical tumour size was the single independent factor decreasing the probability of DFS (P = 0.0054). The 5-year local control rate and metastatic failure rate were 90% and 83.5%, respectively. Haematological effects were moderate. However, six pts had grade 3 acute intestinal toxicity. Four severe late complications requiring surgical intervention were observed (one small bowel complication, three ureteral complications). Primary concomitant chemoradiation followed surgery for bulky operable stage I-II cervical carcinomas can be employed with acceptable toxicity. However, systematic preoperative uterovaginal brachytherapy should increase local tumour control. ","1957":"To evaluate our updated data concerning survival and locoregional control in a study of locally advanced non inflammatory breast cancer after primary chemotherapy followed by external preoperative irradiation. Between 1982 and 1998, 120 patients (75 stage IIIA, 41 stage IIIB, and 4 stage IIIC according to AJCC staging system 2002) were consecutively treated by four courses of induction chemotherapy with anthracycline-containing combinations followed by preoperative irradiation (45 Gy to the breast and nodal areas) and a fifth course of chemotherapy. Three different locoregional approaches were proposed, depending on tumour characteristics and tumour response. After completion of local therapy, all patients received a sixth course of chemotherapy and a maintenance adjuvant chemotherapy regimen without anthracycline. The median follow-up from the beginning of treatment was 140 months. Mastectomy and axillary dissection were performed in 49 patients (with residual tumour larger than 3 cm in diameter or located behind the nipple or with bifocal tumour), and conservative treatment in 71 patients (39 achieved clinical complete response or partial response &gt;90% and received additional radiation boost to initial tumour bed; 32 had residual mass &lt;or=3 cm in diameter and were treated by wide excision and axillary dissection followed by a boost to the excision site). Ten-year actuarial local failure rate was 13% after irradiation alone, 23% after wide excision and irradiation, and 4% after mastectomy (p =0.1). After multivariate analysis, possibility of breast-conserving therapy was related to initial tumour size (&lt;6 vs. &gt;or=6 cm in diameter, p =0.002). Ten-year overall metastatic disease-free survival rate was 61%. After multivariate analysis, metastatic disease-free survival rates were significantly influenced by clinical stage (stage IIIA-B vs. IIIC, p =0.0003), N-stage (N0 vs. N1-2a, and 3c, p =0.017), initial tumour size (&lt;6 vs. &gt;or=6 cm in diameter, p =0.008), and tumour response after induction chemotherapy and preoperative irradiation (clinically complete response + partial response vs. non-response, p =0.0015). In the non conservative breast treatment group, of the 32 patients with no change in clinical tumour size after induction chemotherapy, the 10-year metastatic disease-free survival rate was 59% with only one local relapse. Arm lymphedema was noted in 17% (14 of 81) following axillary dissection and in 2.5% (1 of 39) without axillary dissection. Cosmetic results were satisfactory in 70% of patients treated by irradiation alone and in 51.5% of patients after wide excision and irradiation. Despite the poor prognosis of patients with locally advanced non inflammatory breast cancer resistant to primary anthracycline-based regimen, aggressive locoregional management using preoperative irradiation and mastectomy with axillary dissection offers a possibility of long term survival with low local failure rate for patients without extensive nodal disease. On the other hand, the rate of local failure seems to be high in patients with clinical partial tumour response following induction chemotherapy and breast-conserving treatment combining preoperative irradiation and large wide excision. ","1958":"To validate the use of water as contrast agent for the delineation of the small intestine on the planning CT of external beam in patients treated with conformal radiotherapy for gynaecological tumours. From March to September 2003, 20 patients received an external irradiation for a gynaecological carcinoma (13 with cervix carcinoma, seven with endometrial carcinoma) in the radiotherapy department of the Centre G.F. Leclerc of Dijon. The protocol of opacification of the small intestine consisted in administration of a \"negative\" contrast agent: water. The protocol commonly used for the bladder filling, i.e. absorption of 500 cm(3) of water from 60 to 30 min before the CT-scan, was applied for the evaluation of the visualisation of the small intestine in the 12 first patients (group I). For the last eight patients (group II), the absorption of the same amount of water was fractionated, every 10 min within half an hour before the start of the examination. The small bowel identification was possible in 100% of cases without any need of administration of a \"positive\" contrast agent. In overall, the identification of the small intestine was considered as easy in 14 patients (70%) and as difficult in two patients (10%). In group I, the delineation was considered as easy in 50% of cases, moderately easy in 33% of cases and none easy in 17% of cases. Conversely, no difficulty was encountered for the definition of the small bowel in all patients of group II. Water is an efficient \"negative\" contrast agent for the differentiation of the small bowel from the colon on the planning abdomino-pelvic CT. Nevertheless, the delineation was really made easier only when the fractionated protocol of water absorption within half an hour before CT was used. ","1959":"To report preliminary results of a prospective study of intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT) for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma (HNC) with bilateral irradiation of the neck. At the Alexis Vautrin Cancer Center, 23 patients have been treated with IMRT for HNC since January 2002-August 2003. The first 10 patients with a minimum follow-up of 3 months were analyzed. All tumors were oropharyngeal. There were four females and six males, with a mean age of 50 years (range 39-66). Stages were I-II in eight and III-IV in two. CTV1 was microscopic disease and N0 neck (prescribed dose : 50 Gy) and CTV2 was macroscopic disease and the volume at risk (prescribed dose: 66-70 Gy). PTV were CTV + 5 mm. Patient's immobilization consisted of a five-point head neck shoulder thermoplastic mask. Set-up verifications were done by semi-automatically matching portal images and digitized reconstructed radiographs. IMRT used dynamic multileaf collimation. Five patients (group A) received 50 Gy IMRT (two post-operative and three with a brachytherapy boost with a mean dose: 27.5 Gy), and five patients (group B) received 66-70 Gy IMRT (four post-operative). Acute and late normal tissue effects were graded according to the RTOG-EORTC radiation morbidity scoring criteria. With a median follow-up of 7.4 months (range 3-18.5), no patient died or had loco-regional relapse. The displacements were &lt;4 mm in 98% cases. CTV1 and 2 received 95% of the prescribed dose in 100% of the volume. On average the mean dose to the contralateral parotid was 25.5 Gy for group A vs. 31 Gy for group B (P = 0.09). Mean doses &lt;26 Gy were obtained in three of five patients in group A vs. zero of five patients in group B (P = 0.04). Acute skin toxicities were grade 1 in five patients, grade 2 in four and grade 3 in one. Acute mucositis cases were grade 1 in three patients, grade 2 in five and localized grade 3 in two. At 3 months, 50% of the patients had a grade 0-1 late xerostomia. The 26 Gy dose limit constraint to the contralateral parotid was easier to satisfy when IMRT was prescribed at a maximum dose of 50 Gy. Acute toxicity is low. The displacements in the mask indicate that it is possible to define the PTV as CTV + 4 mm. This reduction should decrease the mean dose to the parotids. At 3 months, a 50% rate of grade 0-1 late xerostomia encourages the hope of a very low rate at 2 years. ","1960":"","1961":"Medical images are of great importance in radiotherapy, which became a privileged application field for image processing techniques. Moreover, because of the progression of the computers' performances, these techniques are also in full expansion. Today, the recent developments of the radiotherapy (3DCR, IMRT) offer a huge place to them. Effectively, they can potentially answer to the precision requirements of the modern radiotherapy, and may then contribute to improve the delivered treatments. The purpose of this article is to present the different image processing techniques that are currently used in radiotherapy (including image matching and segmentation) as they are described in the literature.","1962":"Goal of radiotherapy is to treat patient with the best therapeutic ratio, i.e. the highest local control and the lowest toxicity rates. The conformal approach, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy or intensity-modulated radiotherapy, is based on imageries, up-dated 3-D treatment planning systems, immobilization systems, restricted quality assurance and treatment verification. The aim is to ensure a high dose distribution tailored to the limits of the target volume, while reducing exposure of normal tissues. The evaluation tools used for optimizing treatment are the visual inspection of the dose distribution in various planes, and the dose-volume histograms, but they do not fully quantify the conformity of dose distributions. The conformal index is a tool for scoring a given plan or for evaluating different treatment plans for the same patient. This paper describes the onset and evolution of conformal index and his potential application field.","1963":"","1964":"In the conservative management of breast cancer, radiation therapy delivering 45 to 50 Gy to the whole breast, in 4.5 to 5 weeks, followed by a booster dose of 10 to 20 Gy is the standard of care. Based on the numerous studies which have reported that the local recurrences occurs within and surrounding the primary tumor site and in order to decrease the treatment duration and its morbidity, partial breast irradiation using several techniques has been developed. Partial irradiation may be considered as an alternative local adjuvant treatment for selected patients with favorable prognostic factors. Using external beam radiation therapy, the 3D-conformal technique is appropriate to deliver the whole dose to a limited volume. In UK, an intraoperative technique using a miniature beam of low energy of x-ray (50 Kv) has been developed (Targit). Milan's team have developed an intraoperative electrons beam radiotherapy using a dedicated linear accelerator in the operative room. In USA and Canada the MammoSite has been advised for clinical use in per-operative brachytherapy of the breast. These two last techniques are currently compared in phase III randomised studies to the standard whole breast irradiation followed by a tumour bed booster dose. In this review we will focus on the MammoSite technique and will describe the per-operative implantation procedure, radiological controls ad dosimetric aspects.","1965":"After breast-conservative surgery, radiation therapy delivered to the whole breast to 50 Gy with an additional boost of 10 to 16 Gy is the standard of care. Based upon data showing that the vast majority of the recurrences occur within and surrounding the original tumor site and in order to reduce the morbidity of whole breast radiotherapy and to give the treatment in a shorter time, partial breast irradiation has been developed by several institutions. Partial breast radiotherapy is given by intraoperative radiotherapy (photons or electrons), or brachytherapy (low dose rate or high dose rate) or external radiotherapy using 3D conformal radiation therapy. This is a review of the literature data on this topic.","1966":"Margin and histological size of ductal in situ carcinoma or intraductal component of an infiltrative carcinoma are important prognostic factors to predict presence\/absence as well as amount of residual tumor burden. Their evaluation requires standardized pathological analysis. These factors should be interpreted in clinical and radiological context.","1967":"Breast MR imaging and PET allow physiopathological tissular approach of breast tumors through tumoral angiogenesis. All these series published agreed in the high sensitivity of breast MRI for detecting invasive breast cancers whereas the sensitivity varies from 60 to 85% in detecting ductal carcinoma in situ. However, its specificity reported varies between 60 and 97%, mainly due to some entities such as fibroadenomas and fibrocystic disease. Clinical indication are the diagnosis of local relapses, the evaluation of pre-operative chemotherapy, the diagnosis of an isolated axillary lymphadenopathy, pre-operative evaluation of breast cancer and follow up of breast prothesis.","1968":"Concomitant radiotherapy (5FU-MMC) was proved to be useful in locally advanced anal canal carcinoma. Nevertheless, it remains 30% of failures after this conservative treatment. The tolerance and efficiency of a neoadjuvant chemotherapy (5-FU-CDDP) were validated by a phase II trial including 80 patients, which obtained 73% of colostomy free survival and 70% of relapse free survival at 3-year follow-up. Its usefulness is studied in an ongoing phase III trial, as well as the dose escalation of the boost, from 15 Gy to 25-25 Gy. The results of the 101 first included patients are studied by an intermediate analyze. In July 2003, 222 patients were enrolled by 33 investigating centres out of the 350 planned patients until the end of the trial in December 2004.","1969":"Since 1980, curative-intent radiation therapy of epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal is the standard first line treatment. The combined concomitant chemotherapy and radiation therapy is presently established for locally advanced tumors more than 4 cm in length and\/or with nodal involvement. We report the Tenon hospital experience since 1972 concerning the long term results after radiation therapy, the modifications of the radiation technique, and the evolution of treatment strategy.","1970":"Thirty-five patients with clinically N0 cancers of the canal anal, 33 epidermoid carcinomas et 2 melanomas were histologically staged with inguinal sentinel lymph node biopsy (ISN). With the combined technique, blue dye and radiocolloid the ISN was identified in 100% of the cases. The ISN was invaded in 7 cases\/33 for epidermoid tumors and 2\/2 for melanomas. After 18 months of follow-up, no inguinal recurrence could be seen in ISN pN0 cases. In conclusion, ISN biopsy is a reliable procedure to stage anal canal cancers. It should prevent unnecessary prophylactic inguinal irradiation for pN0 ISN. Inguinal irradiation is only indicated in pN1 ISN.","1971":"Among the different possibilities to check the accuracy of the treatment delivered, only in vivo dosimetry ensures the precision of the dose delivered to the patient during the treatment. In 1970-1980, Ruden assessed the use of thermoluminescent dosimetry to perform in vivo measurements at Radiumemmet in Stockholm. Straightforward in its principle but demanding in its implementation, thermoluminescent dosimetry has largely been used. Today, thanks to the work of Rikner, the use of semiconductor detectors allows the general implementation of in vivo dosimetry. Tomorrow, we will use electronic portal imaging device to verify the geometrical patient setup and the dose delivery at the same time. Its implementation remains complex and will need the development of algorithms to compute exit dose or midplane dose using portal in vivo dosimetry. First clinical results show that portal imaging is an accurate alternative for conventional in vivo dosimetry using diodes.","1972":"Radiotherapy is generally considered as the standard treatment for most testicular seminomas. However, there have been substantial changes in the management of these tumours over the past few years. In early seminoma, there is a trend towards a decrease in treatment intensity or even towards therapeutic abstention (i.e. surveillance); whereas in advanced cases, combination chemotherapy is taking over from radiotherapy. In stage I, where cure rates are almost 100%, the limiting of the lymph node area to be irradiated and decrease of the dose to 20-25 Gy was followed by very low long-term toxicity rates, and a very small risk of infertility, without compromising the overall prognosis. Surveillance is an acceptable alternative to postoperative radiotherapy. However, the risk of nodal relapse is around 18-20%. With surveillance, the frequency and duration of follow-up is increased in comparison to the same with postoperative radiotherapy, with higher cost. In stage IIa, radiotherapy remains the standard but recent studies have shown that limiting the nodal volume to the paraortic area is justified as in stage I. In stage IIb and higher, combination chemotherapy is almost always given. However, the association between carboplatin and radiotherapy represents an efficient and well-tolerated alternative. Late tissue damage and the risk of decrease in fertility are minimized with novel radiotherapeutic approaches. However, the occurrence of second cancers in the long term is a matter of concern. It is possible though, that patients with seminoma have a tendency per se to develop second cancers. The prognosis of cryptorchid seminoma and of HCG-producing seminoma has been the subject of controversy but recent large studies have demonstrated that stage for stage, the cure rates are similar to those of other seminomas.","1973":"Germ-cell tumors of the testis are rare tumors of the young adult. Half of them are seminoma. The majority of patients have disease limited to the testis. Radiotherapy still remains the standard treatment of these patients. Almost all patients are cured by orchidectomy and radiotherapy on the lomboaortic area extended to homolateral iliac area. The dose is 24 to 30 Gy in a standard fractionation. Different studies are ongoing to reduce the irradiation field (omission of the pelvic irradiation), to decrease irradiation dose (to 20 Gy). Other treatment options are strict surveillance and adjuvant carboplatin based chemotherapy. None of these options are standard treatments. A strict attention must be directed on controlateral germ-cell tumors and second cancers.","1974":"Hyperthermia between 40 and 45 degrees C is now recognized to radiosensitive tumors locally increasing local control. The more recent technological progress show the possibility of heating at depth while controlling temperature by opened NMR. In Germany and Netherland, hyperthermia is a standard treatment for cervix carcinomas and for some sarcomas. Many on going clinical trials has been recently opened and a European network of excellence \"Eurotherm\" is proposed. More recently thermo-sensitive liposomes has been proposed in the US for carrying and targeting not only chemotherapeutics agents but also gene therapies. In France, these deep heating techniques are not applied. Today, only microwave superficial hyperthermia, thermo ablation using either radiofrequencies or high focussed ultrasound, and loco regional heating by intraperitoneal perfusion or by external circulation for tumors of the extremities, are in clinical evaluation. Is appears suitable to define clinical French teams, that could evaluate the clinical use of deep heating by the more recent developed techniques.","1975":"During more than a half of century, numerous compounds have been tested in different models against radiation-induced cataract. In this report, we will review the radioprotectors that have been already tested for non-human crystalline lens protection. We will focus on the most important published studies in this topic and the mechanisms of cytoprotection reported in vitro and in vivo from animals. The most frequent mechanisms incriminated in the cytoprotective effect are: free radical scavenging, limitation of lipid peroxidation, modulation of cycle progression increase of intracellular reduced glutathion pool, reduction of DNA strand breaks and limitation of apoptotic cell death. Amifostine (or Ethyol) and anethole dithiolethione (or Sulfarlem), already used clinically as chemo- and radioprotectants, could be further tested for ocular radioprotection particularly for radiation-induced cataract.","1976":"The STIC 2001 and STIC 2002 projects intend to allow the implementation and the assessment of Intensity Modulated Radiation Therapy in France. IMRT is an innovative technique in which the high-dose radiation volume conforms to an accurately defined target volume with less morbidity to the surrounding normal tissues. The main medical objectives of the projects are (1) to improve the therapeutic index while decreasing acute toxicity and late sequelae (mainly xerostomia and acute mucite for head and neck tumors), which allows an increase in the radiation dose to the tumor and then a better tumor control; (2) to propose a salvage treatment to patients who locally recurred in previously irradiated sites; (3) to determine the optimal treatment guidelines for a safe use of the technique in clinical routine. Our projects also aim at comparing IMRT and 3D conformal treatments on the one hand (STIC 2001), and IMRT and conventional treatments on the other hand (STIC 2002), with regard to costs. As a matter of fact, the use of IMRT is presently limited in France because its implementation requires high investment and personnel costs. The seventeen French Regional Cancer Centres involved in the two projects intend to study the additional cost of the use IMRT in comparison with the use of standard techniques, which appears to be a step for a wide use of this technique in France. Each of the studies is two-year prospective, and includes patients with head and neck tumors treated with a curative intend (post operative or exclusive treatments for STIC 2002 and STIC 2002), and patients with a prostate cancer (STIC 2001).","1977":"Progresses of the three-dimensional imageries and of the software of planning systems makes that the radiotherapy of the tumours of brain and the base of skull is increasingly precise. The set-up of the patients and the positioning of the beams are key acts whose realization can become extremely tiresome if the requirement of precision increases. This precision very often rests still on the visual comparison of digital images. In the near future, the development of the automated systems controlled by robots should allow a noticeable improvement of the precision, safety and speed of the patient set-up.","1978":"State-of-the-art robotized systems developed for surgery are either remotely controlled manipulators that duplicate gestures made by the surgeon (endoscopic surgery applications), or automated robots that execute trajectories defined relatively to pre-operative medical imaging (neurosurgery and orthopaedic surgery). This generation of systems primarily applies existing robotics technologies (the remote handling systems and the so-called \"industrial robots\") to current surgical practices. It has contributed to validate the huge potential of surgical robotics, but it suffers from several drawbacks, mainly high costs, excessive dimensions and some lack of user-friendliness. Nevertheless, technological progress let us anticipate the appearance in the near future of miniaturised surgical robots able to assist the gesture of the surgeon and to enhance his perception of the operation at hand. Due to many in-the-body articulated links, these systems will have the capability to perform complex minimally invasive gestures without obstructing the operating theatre. They will also combine the facility of manual piloting with the accuracy and increased safety of computer control, guiding the gestures of the human without offending to his freedom of action. Lastly, they will allow the surgeon to feel the mechanical properties of the tissues he is operating through a genuine \"remote palpation\" function. Most probably, such technological evolutions will lead the way to redesigned surgical procedures taking place inside new operating rooms featuring a better integration of all equipments and favouring cooperative work from multidisciplinary and sometimes geographically distributed medical staff.","1979":"Respiration-gated radiotherapy offers a significant potential for improvement in the irradiation of tumor sites affected by respiratory motion such as lung, breast and liver tumors. An increased conformality of irradiation fields leading to decreased complications rates of organs at risk (lung, heart...) is expected. Respiratory gating is in line with the need for improved precision required by radiotherapy techniques such as 3D conformal radiotherapy or intensity modulated radiotherapy. Reduction of respiratory motion can be achieved by using either breath hold techniques or respiration synchronized gating techniques. Breathhold techniques can be achieved with active, in which airflow of the patient is temporarily blocked by a valve, or passive techniques, in which the patient voluntarily breath-hold. Synchronized gating techniques use external devices to predict the phase of the respiration cycle while the patient breaths freely. These techniques presently investigated in several medical centers worldwide. Although promising, the first results obtained in lung and liver cancer patients require confirmation. Physical, technical and physiological questions still remain to be answered. This paper describes the most frequently used gated techniques and the main published clinical reports on the use of respiration-gated radiotherapy in order to evaluate the impact of these techniques.","1980":"The dose-response relationship is a fundamental basis of radiobiology. Despite many clinical datas, difficulties remain to demonstrate a relation between dose and local control: relative role of treatment associated with radiation therapy (surgery, chemotherapy, hormonal therapy), tumor heterogeneity, few prospective randomized studies, uncertainty of local control assessment. Three different situations are discussed: tumors with high local control probabilities for which dose effect is demonstrated by randomized studies (breast cancer) or sound retrospective datas (soft tissues sarcomas), tumors with intermediate local control probabilities for which dose effect seems to be important according to retrospective studies and ongoing or published phase III trials (prostate cancer), tumors with low local control probabilities for which dose effect appears to be modest beyond standard doses, and inferior to the benefit of concurrent chemotherapy (lung and oesophageal cancer). For head and neck tumors, the dose-response relationship has been explored through hyperfractionation and accelerated radiation therapy and a dose effect has been demonstrated but must be compared to the benefit of concurrent chemotherapy. Last but not least, the development of conformal radiotherapy allow the exploration of the dose response relationship for tumors such as hepatocellular carcinomas traditionally excluded from the field of conventional radiation therapy. In conclusion, the dose-response relationship remains a sound basis of radiation therapy for many tumors and is a parameter to take into account for further randomized studies.","1981":"The endometrial carcinoma is the third most common cancer in women. The endometrioid adenocarcinomas represent 75% to 80% of the pathologic sub-types, and 90% of the lesions are stages I or II at diagnosis. The treatment strategies are based upon surgery and radiotherapy, but the respective place of external irradiation and vaginal cuff brachytherapy is not strictly established. The role of the pelvic lymphadenectomy and the role of chemotherapy for aggressive histologies or locally advanced diseases remain also controversial issues. The question \"which radiotherapy for which patient?\" is still a current question, however, the answers we will bring do not permit yet to remove all uncertainties.","1982":"The majority of patients with newly diagnosed invasive breast cancer require adjuvant treatment after surgery with radiation, chemotherapy, and hormonal treatment. This article reviews the important topic of treatment sequencing in breast cancer to optimally integrate all the adjuvant treatments.","1983":"Initially, preoperative chemotherapy had three aims, to improve the overall survival by an early exposure to systemic therapy, to evaluate in vivo the efficacy of chemotherapy and to monitor post-operative treatment, and to increase the rate of breast-conserving treatments. Eight randomised trials have been published. The general consensus about the results of these trials is that neoadjuvant chemotherapy did not improve overall survival, in comparison with an adjuvant treatment. Clinical and especially pathological complete response rates were correlated with the outcome of the patients and could be considered as an independent prognostic factor. Primary chemotherapy is a powerful tool to study the predictive factors, especially biological factors, of chemosensitivity. However, the usefulness of this approach to adjust post-operative treatments remains to be demonstrated. Finally, primary chemotherapy slightly increased the rate of breast conserving treatments, but is accompanied by a small increase in the risk of local recurrence. To propose a conservative treatment to a woman initially not suitable for a lumpectomy needs clear information about this enhanced risk.","1984":"In breast cancer, radiation therapy improves local control rate and survival. When chemotherapy and radiation are indicated the sequencing of the two treatments is still controversial. Several studies have suggested that adjuvant radiotherapy could be safely delayed until adjuvant chemotherapy was completed. Other studies, most of them retrospective, pointed out that a delay in the initiation of radiotherapy to give chemotherapy first, will result in a increased rate of local recurrence. Concomitant administration of the two treatments is an alternative. Pilot studies have suggested the feasibility of simultaneous administration using selected regimen as CMF or FNC. A randomized phase III trials has been conducted to compare sequential treatment with chemotherapy first and radiation versus concomitant treatments. Preliminary results of this study are presented.","1985":"It is well known that the conservative reference treatment of infiltrative carcinoma of the breast, after en bloc complete excision, should be completed by irradiation of the whole breast delivering 50 Gy in 25 fractions. The discussion related to the validity and the procedures of delivery of the boost of the tumor bed has to be adjusted with our knowledge of specific prognostic factors of local recurrence. Through the two phase III randomized trials published in the literature, the young age of the patient, palpable tumor and negative receptor to progesterone may be recognized as statistically linked to a higher risk of local recurrence. Tumor size and palpable tumor remain unquestionable factors of bad prognosis. The true level of significativeness of age remains controversial as well as peri-tumoral characteristics such as ductal carcinoma in situ. Treatment technique should be rigorous either in terms of prescription of external radiation therapy or for the boost. They have a major impact on the cosmetic result and the fibrosis rate. Improvement of the results is expected through careful analysis of genic and molecularly prognostic factors of the tumor in order to select patients amenable to this type of technique.","1986":"Sentinel lymph node biopsy is a major diagnostic procedure in breast cancer surgery. Although adopted worldwide, its routine practice has not been validated yet. This article proposes a review of national and international controlled clinical trials whose aims are definitely to answer remaining unsolved questions.","1987":"Breast-conserving treatment for breast cancer combines lumpectomy, axillary nodes treatment and radiotherapy of the breast. Conservative surgery and radiotherapy is now the standard treatment for unifocal, non inflammatory tumors, less than 3 cm in diameter. The widespread use of mammographic screening leads to a significant increase in the proportion of non palpable breast carcinomas, and has contributed to increase the proportion of breast conserving treatments. Neoadjuvant treatments (chemotherapy, radiotherapy and hormonotherapy) can also extend the indications of breast conservation to breast carcinomas larger than 3 cm. Furthermore, in the last ten years, new surgical procedures (sentinel node biopsy, oncoplastic surgery, minimal invasive surgery) have been developed, increasing the surgical possibilities. After a learning phase to establish new standards for these procedures, all these techniques are now part of our standard surgical apparel, thus extending the possibilities of breast conserving surgery.","1988":"The increasing incidence of DCIS during the past 20 years needs a continuous evaluation of the treatment strategies and a multidisciplinary decision process. The management of the DCIS remains a challenging issue in 2003. Mastectomy should still be considered as the reference treatment which is able to guarantee cure in almost all cases, whereas breast conserving surgery followed by radiation therapy is associated with 7-10% of local recurrence. However, the increasing knowledge of the predictive factors of the local recurrence allows to propose a conservative treatment strategy to a large amount of patients, without negative impact on their prognosis. This review presents the arguments that permit to justify the reasoned choice of the different therapeutic options according to the clinico-pathological situations.","1989":"In 2004, breast cancer screening will be effective in France. This evolution has a strong impact on our mammographic practice that becomes a real mission of public health. Digital mammography, compared to screen-film mammography, provides the same results for the detection of breast cancer, computer-aided detection systems represent the most relevant application of this technology at this time. The setting up of a quality control will allow the introduction of this technology in screening during 2004. Percutaneous imaging-guided procedures are now currently used for the diagnosis of nonpalpable breast lesions and allow the selection of patients for surgery. These procedures have emphasized the need for a multidisciplinary approach of the patients. Indications of MRI have not changed because of its moderated specificity and no relevant development of interventional-guided procedures. Work on standardization of radiological reports and assessment categories goes on. This classification is already applied for mammography, and new classifications for lesions detected by ultrasound or MRI will be published by the American College of Radiology (Breast Imaging Reporting and Data System, 4th edition, available in 2003).","1990":"","1991":"- To identify predicting factors of local control and survival after isolate local failure by statistical analysis of the data after breast-conserving treatment for early breast cancer. - In time of local failure, mean age was 54.7 years old, mean tumor size was 19.3 mm and recurrence was more often infiltrating ductal carcinoma (88%). Local recurrence was unifocal in 44 cases and localised outside of the site of the primary tumorectomy in 35 cases. Local failure treatment was a radical mastectomy or parietectomy (53 patients). Hormonotherapy was delivered in 36 patients and chemotherapy was delivered in 26 patients. Mean follow-up was 62 months. - Fifteen patients developed second local recurrence in a mean time of 36 months. Five years local control rate was 68% after the first local failure. Surgery treatment (non-conservative surgery vs. conservative surgery) was the only factor which influenced local control. Six patients developed homolateral axillary and\/or supraclavicular node recurrence. Twelve patients underwent metastasis in a mean time of 36 months after the first local recurrence. Five years metastasis free survival rate was 80%. Peritumoral vascular invasion in time of the first local failure increased metastasis risk and node recurrence. Second local failure did not alter metastasis free survival. - Peritumoral vascular invasion in time of the first local failure decreased node and metastasis free survival. Surgery should be radical, but the place of chemotherapy and hormonotherapy was not definite. ","1992":"- Between 1983 and 1992 a total of 55 patients suffering from prostate cancer were treated with pions (pi-mesons) at the Paul Scherrer Institute in Villigen, Switzerland. This form of therapy was used at only three centers world wide on 245 patients with this diagnosis. Since the last project in Vancouver, Canada, was closed in 1994, this form of therapy has been relegated to the realm of history. - In a retrospective analysis, the data of 49 of the 55 patients, that was qualified for evaluation was brought up-to-date and evaluated. Median and mean age at the time of therapy was 65 years. Advanced stage tumors were overly represented, in respect to T-stages (35\/49 stage T3 and T4) and differentiation (11\/49 G1). The treatment volumes were between 67 and 1330 cm(3), and the mean delivered dose was 32.2 pion-Gray. Survival probability, the probability of metastases and the local control rate were calculated according to Kaplan-Meier. - Seven of the 49 patients had already been diagnosed with metastatic disease before treatment began, 16 developed metastases during the follow-up observation period. Local control after 2 years was 89%, and after 5 years 83%. The survival rate after 2 years was 87%, and 66% after 5 years, excluding non-tumor related deaths. The rate of late toxicity was acceptable. - Seen in retrospect, pion treatment of prostate carcinoma proved to be an effective form of therapy with a low rate of late toxicity. But, in comparison to the possibilities offered by modern conventional radiation therapy, this method would certainly not be today's first choice. ","1993":"- The induction of malignant diseases is one of the most concerning late effects of ionizing radiation. The topic of this study deals with skin tumors developed in the irradiated areas in children given X-ray therapy for tinea capitis. - All patients with malignant tumors of the scalp referred to Salah Azaiz Institute between 1970 and 2001 have been questioned in order to determine if there had been a prior X-ray irradiation for tinea capitis, its modality, and its consequences. The first scalp irradiation goes back to 1922 and the last was performed in 1963. - Ninety-eight patients with 150 radio-induced cancers of the scalp following irradiation for tinea capitis are reported (1.5 lesion per patient). The patients were irradiated in various hospitals and dispensaries throughout the country. Eighty-one patients (82%) had only one session of radiation. The average age at irradiation was 12 (+\/-6) years, the latent period for radiation-induced skin cancers was 36 (+\/-14) years. In 61 patients (62%), the scalp appeared normal and in 38% radiodermatitis was noted. Patient age at diagnosis of malignancy varied from 20 to 83 years with an average of 47 years. Basal cell carcinomas (125 cases) and spinocellular carcinomas (16 cases) were the most common, three other cases of annexial tumors, two malignant non-Hodgkin's lymphomas and four melanoma lesions are also present. Radiotherapy was used for the treatment of 74 patients (alone in 42 and associated with surgery in 32 patients); 14 patients had exclusive surgical excision. - Basal cell carcinomas are the most frequent tumors arising on chronic radiodermatitis. In spite of the long latency period, patients' young age at irradiation explained the occurrence of these cancers at a relatively young age. Literature review is suggesting recessive mutation of tumor-suppressor genes as the characteristic abnormality in radio-induced cancer.

Treatment planning included an inverse-planning approach, and the desired beam intensity profiles were delivered by dynamic multileaf collimation. All patients received the entire treatment course with IMRT to a prescribed dose of 78 Gy. All IMRT treatment plans were compared with a theoretical conventional three-dimensional conformal radiation therapy (3D-CRT). Acute lower gastro-intestinal (GI) and genito-urinary (GU) toxicity was evaluated in all patients and graded according to the Common Toxicity Criteria for Adverse Events version 3.0 (CTCAE v. 3.0). A relationship between dose volume and clinical toxicity was evaluated. - Ninety-five percent of the PTV2 received more than 76 Gy using IMRT or 3D-CRT with no difference between both methods. The dose-volume histogram mean obtained for the PTV2 was not different between IMRT and 3D-CRT. IMRT improved homogeneity of the delivered dose to the PTV2 as compared with 3D-CRT (7.5 vs 9%, respectively). Ninety-five percent of the PTV1 received 5 Gy more using IMRT with protection of the bladder and the rectum walls. The benefit was considered below 75 and 70 Gy for the wall of the bladder and the rectum, respectively. Grade 2 GI and GU toxicity was observed in four (25%) and five (31%) patients, respectively. No grade 3 toxicity was observed. There was a trend towards a relationship between the mean rectal dose and acute rectal toxicity but without statistical significant difference (P =0.09). - Dose escalation with IMRT is feasible with no grade 3 or higher acute GI or GU toxicity. Examination of a larger cohort and longer-term follow-up are warranted in the future. ","1997":"","1998":"Seminoma accounts for about 40% of germ cell tumours of the testicle. In this retrospective analysis, we review literature concerning management of stage I seminoma. Between March 1987 and April 2001, 65 patients with stage I pure testicular seminoma received adjuvant radiotherapy with a 25 MV linear accelerator. Median age was 33 years. Testicular tumour has been found on the right testis in 39 patients and on the left one in 24 patients. Patients have been treated using an anterior-posterior parallel pair and have received 20-25 Gy in 10-14 fractions. The target volume consisted of paraaortic, and paraaortic + homolateral iliac lymph nodes in 17 and 46 patients, respectively. Acute toxicity was mainly digestive, 38% of patients presenting nausea and vomiting. Median follow-up time was 37 months. All patients are alive in complete remission. Because of good radio-sensitivity of seminoma, radiotherapy is regarded as standard adjuvant treatment (5 years relapse rate: 3-5%). Acute toxicity is dominated by moderate gastro-intestinal side effects. Secondary neoplasia represents one of the worst possible long-term complications of therapy. Waiting for ongoing randomised trials, the modern literature for seminoma reflects a trend toward lower radiation doses (20-25 Gy) and smaller treatment volumes (paraaortic field). Adjuvant chemotherapy with two courses of carboplatin, might be equivalent to radiotherapy but must be investigated in randomised trials. A surveillance policy is one of the other management options less recommended. ","1999":null,"2000":"To retrospectively assess the efficacy of post-mastectomy re-irradiation for local relapse of breast cancer. Twenty patients, initially treated by conservative surgery and radiotherapy (50 Gy in 25 fractions over 5 weeks) were treated from 1998 to 2001 for a local relapse by salvage mastectomy and re-irradiation (either electron or photon beams). Mean age was 53 years (31-71). Reasons for re-irradiation were that the local relapses were inflammatory (4 pts), multifocal (5 pts), cutaneous (5 pts), involved the nipple (3 pts) or because the surgical margins (either muscle or skin) were involved (3 pts). The median dose of re-irradiation was 45 Gy (33-65) in 15 fractions over 33 days. Mean follow-up was 48 months (5-97). Fifteen patients remained free of a second local recurrence and 10 were still alive, without metastasis. Neither the dose of re-irradiation nor the irradiated surfaces were prognostic factors of local control (P = 0.877 and P = 0.424). Five patients developed radiation-induced pneumonitis without functional respiratory impairment. The incidence of pneumonitis seemed to be related to the biological dose of re-irradiation (P = 0.037). Other late complications occurred such as pigmentation changes (12 pts), telangiectasia (8 pts), chondritis (2 pts), parietal fibrosis (7 pts), rib fractures (4 pts), severe pain (11 pts) and lymphedema (2 pts). The increase in biological equivalent dose was highly statistically linked with the occurrence of disabling pain (P = 0.0123). Parietal re-irradiation achieves good and lasting local control with an acceptable rate of acute complications but with a risk of disabling late sequelae such as severe pain. ","2001":"The first part of our work has focused on the relationship between tumor volume and tumor control. Indeed, it is well known that the importance of irradiated volume could be a main parameter of radiation-induced complications. Numerous mathematical models have described the correlation between the irradiated volume and the risk of adverse effects. These models should predict the complication rate of each treatment planning. At the present time late effects have been the most studied. In this report we firstly propose a review of different mathematical models described for volume effect. Secondly, we will discuss whether these theoretical considerations can influence our view of radiation treatment planning optimization.","2002":"Neutrons have radiobiological characteristics, which differ from those of conventional radiotherapy beams (photons) and which offer a theoretical advantage over photons to fight radioresistance by the differential relative biological effect of them between normal and tumour tissues. Neutron therapy beneficed of great interest between 1975 and 1985. Many of phase III trials were conducted and indications have been definitively deducted of them. After briefly describing the properties of neutron beams, this review discusses the indication of neutron therapy on the basis of the clinical results. Salivary, prostate tumours and sarcomas are the main indications of neutron therapy. In concern to the prostate cancers, other alternative treatments reduce the neutron therapy field. For sarcomas, the lack of randomised trials limits the impact of the interest of neutrons. For other tumours, the ratio benefice\/risk of neutron therapy is inferior to these obtained with photons and they could not be considered like classical indications.","2003":"Protons have physical characteristics, which differ from those of photons used in conventional radiotherapy. Better shielding of critical organs is obtained by using their particular ballistic (Bragg peak and lateral narrow penumbra). Some indications as ocular melanoma, chordoma and chondrosarcoma of the base of skull are now strongly accepted by the radiation oncologist community. Others are still in evaluation: meningioma, locally advanced nasopharynx tumor and paediatric tumors. The aim of this review is to present the clinical results of a technic which seems \"confidential\" because of the rarety and the cost of equipments.","2004":"Brain metastases from cervical cancer are extremely rare. We report on two patients who developed cerebellous metastases following uterine cervical cancer. The interval between diagnosis of the primary cancer and diagnosis of brain metastasis was 8 months. The main complaint was symptoms of increased intracranial pressure and cerebellous syndrome. Surgical excision of the brain lesion followed by radiation therapy was performed in the first case. The second patient received palliative radiation therapy. The first patient died 8 months after diagnosis. The second patient is alive 2 months after diagnosis.","2005":"Angiocentric lymphoma of the face is a rare malignancy. During 11 years, only two patients were treated for a lymphoma of the face. The first patient, 31-year-old, had an angiocentric lymphoma of the nasal cavity, the second patient, 40-year-old, had an angiocentric lymphoma of the nasopharynx and the maxillary sinuses, with an extension the hard palate. According to the Ann Arbor classification, the disease was stage IEab and stage IIEbb, respectively. The first patient was treated by chemotherapy alone (COP regimen) and the second patient underwent combined chemotherapy (CHOP) and radiotherapy. The follow-up was marked by progression of the disease 7 and 9 months after the end of the treatment in the two cases. For the angiocentric lymphoma, treatment based on radiotherapy or chemotherapy alone or combined does not often provide local control and the overall survival rate does not exceed 40% at 5 years.","2006":"Central nervous system leiomyosarcomas are extremely rare, however, they became more frequent among immunodeficient patients, either in a patients infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), or after organ transplantation. The data of the literature indicate that the infection by Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) plays a causal role in the development of these tumours but its precise role in the oncogenesis remains unresolved. We report a new case of EBV associated leiomyosarcoma of the left cavernous sinus occurring after renal transplantation. The epidemiological, clinical, pathological and therapeutic characteristics of these tumours are discussed.","2007":null,"2008":"The thyroid dysfunction after radiotherapy has led to evaluate the dose received by thyroid during nasopharynx and breast carcinoma irradiation. This evaluation was facilitated by in vivo dosimetry. The aims of this work were to evaluate the thyroid dose and to compare released dose at the reference point in the two localizations. A total of 30 patients were evaluated: 18 patients with nasopharynx carcinoma and 12 patients with breast carcinoma were included in the final analysis. In the first group, the total thyroid but the isthmus was irradiated. On the other hand, in the second group, only one thyroid lobe was included into the target volume. All patients have been treated by gamma rays of cobalt 60 and the thyroid absorbed dose was measured by semiconductor dosimeters (Scanditronix DPD6). These dosimeters were calibrated in the same geometric conditions of the irradiation. The measured absorbed dose of the thyroid parenchyma was equal to the calculated absorbed dose at the target that has been specified at a depth of -3 cm. Under the block, the isthmus received 5.1 +\/- 0.9 Gy (9.9 +\/- 1.8%) in nasopharynx carcinoma irradiation. However, in breast carcinoma irradiation, the distal thyroid lobe and the isthmus received 2.9 +\/- 0.7 Gy (6.55 +\/- 1.56%) and 3.69 +\/- 0.77 (8.39 +\/- 1.76%), respectively. This study shows that the thyroid received a dose equal to the prescribed dose in both nasopharynx and breast cancer patients.

To update clinical practice guidelines for the management of patients with salivary gland malignant tumors previously validated in 1997. These recommendations cover diagnosis, treatment and follow-up of patients with these tumors. The methodology is based on a literature review and critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary group of experts who define the CPGs according to the definitions of the Standards, Options and Recommendations project. Once the guidelines have been defined, the document is submitted for review by independent reviewers. This article presents the updated clinical practice guidelines concerning irradiation of patient with salivary gland tumors. The main recommendations are: 3 dimensional conformal radiotherapy (with or without intensity modulation) or 2D irradiation can be used; for surgical complete resected patients, postoperative photon radiotherapy should not be used in case of low grade stage I and 11 tumors(standard, level of evidence B2) but should be used for high grade stage II, II and IV tumors and for low grade stage III and IV tumors(standard, level of evidence B2). Neutron therapy should not be used in all of these cases (standard, level of evidence D); for patients presenting an incomplete macroscopic or microscopic surgical residual disease, postoperative irradiation must be delivered(standard). Neutron or photon therapy can be either delivered (options); for non operable patients neutron or photon therapy can be either delivered (options, level of evidence B2); for unresectable tumors or in case of recurrent neoplasms, exclusive neutron therapy or surgical tumor reduction combined with postoperative photon beam irradiation can be proposed (options, level of evidence C). ","2010":"The aim of quality control procedures during radiation therapy is to check the consistency between actual and prescribed treatments. Given the technical complexity of modern radiotherapy, stricter policies are necessary to meet increasing requirements for quality and safety. Among the various tools available, electronic imaging systems play an increasing role in patient-beam position checking and in vivo dose measurements. Written procedures will have to be established in order to describe the control modalities and frequency, as well as the rules for error corrections according to the treatment intent. Non medical staff will be devoted to new tasks, under the radiation oncologist's responsibility. A special attention should be directed at electronic archives, since the present technology is unlikely to meet the legal requirement to keep medical records accessible for at least 30 years.","2011":"The paper presents the characteristics, the place and the limits of brachytherapy in prostate radiotherapy. While sparing the rectal wall, erectile function as well as urinary continence, I(125) and Pd(103) permanent implants represent interesting approaches for good prognosis tumours in comparison to surgery or conformal external beam radiotherapy with similar cure rates. Overcoming easily the problems of organ motion and patient positioning while allowing doses per fraction as high as 10 Gy, brachytherapy is an excellent boosting method in the treatment of intermediate or unfavourable prognosis tumours of which alpha\/beta is 1,5 Gy. Encouraging biological control rates of 80-90% have been published in phase II trials. Compared to external beam radiotherapy, the heterogeneity of irradiation inside the clinical target volume should increase the probability of cure as for a specific dose, a significant part will be overdosed. So far, 120-130% of the prescribed doses are delivered to the peripheral zone at the origin of 70% of tumours. On the opposite, this heterogeneity is inducing an overdosage of the urethral bed at the price of higher toxicity levels in situations of previous obstructive syndrome and urethral stenosis. A better integration of the therapeutic modalities available, brachytherapy included, should increase our curative possibilities in the radiation treatment of prostatic cancer.","2012":"Prognosis of pancreatic carcinoma remains poor, with one-year and five-year overall survival rates of 20 and 5% respectively. Only 5 to 15% of patients present with tumors amenable to resection. Long-term (5 years) survival after curative resection is less than 20%, and the median survival is about 12 months. This paper updates recent trends about concomitant chemoradiation. At first, a review of the studies on adjuvant chemoradiation after surgery is proposed. Then, indications of preoperative chemoradiation for patients with localized resectable adenocarcinoma are discussed. The last part concerns the most important and recent studies about chemoradiation in locally advanced pancreatic cancer, either with 5-fluoro-uracile or based on new drugs like gemcitabine.","2013":"To identify prognostic factors and treatment toxicity in a serie of epidermoid cancers of the anal canal without evident metastasis. Between June 1972 and January 1997, 305 patients (pts) were treated with curative-intent radiation therapy (RT). The T-stages according to the 1987 UICC classification were: 26 T1, 141 T2, 104 T3, and 34 T4. There were 49 pts with nodal involvement at presentation. Pretreatment anal function scoring according to our in-house system was: 22 scored 0, 182 scored 1, 74 scored 2, 7 scored 3, 11 scored 4, and 9 not available pts. The treatment started with external beam RT (EBRT) in 303 pts (median dose: 45 Gy). After a rest period of 4 to 6 weeks, a boost of 20 Gy was delivered by EBRT in 279 pts and by interstitial 192Ir brachytherapy (Bcy) in 17 pts. Seven pts received only one course of EBRT (mean dose: 49.5 Gy) and 2 pts were treated with interstitial 192Ir Bcy alone (55 and 60 Gy, respectively). Concomitant chemotherapy (5-fluoro-uracil and either mitomycin C or cisplatin) was delivered to 19 pts. Mean follow-up was 103 months. At the end of RT local tumor clinical complete response (cCR) rate was 80%. Out of 61 non responders or local progressive tumors 27 (44%) were salvaged with abdominoperineal resection (APR). The rate of local tumor relapse (LR) was 12%. Out of 37 LTR, 20 (54%) were salvaged with APR and one with interstitial 192Ir Bcy. The orevall local tumor control (LC) rate with or without salvage local treatment was 84%. LC rate with a good anal function scoring (score 0 and 1) was 56.5%. Among 181\/186 available pts who preserved their anus, 94% had a good anal function scoring. For a subgroup of 15 pts with length tumor &lt;2 cm-N0, the LC rate after the end of RT was 100%, the LC rate with or without local salvage treatment was 100%, and among 13 available pts who preserved their anus, the anal function scoring was good in 12 pts (92%). The 10-years disease-free survival was 74%. After multivariate analysis, 3 independent predicting factors significantly influenced the disease-free survival: gap duration between 2 courses of RT (&gt;38 days vs &lt; or =38 days, P =0.0025), pretreatment anal function scoring (0 vs 1 vs 2 vs 3 vs 4, P =4.4 10(-6)), and cCR after the end of RT (no complete response vs complete response, P =2.5 10(-14)). We confirm excellent results with RT in T1 and T2 lesions.

Postoperative RT was indicated because extracapsular infiltration (ECI) was observed in 20 (29%), positive surgical margins (PSM) in 20 (29%) or both in 23 patients (34%). Treatment consisted of external beam RT 66 Gy in 5 weeks and 3 days. Median follow-up was 15 months. According to CTC 2.0, acute morbidity was acceptable: grade 3 mucositis was observed in 15 (22%) patients, grade 3 dysphagia in 19 (28%) patients, grade 3 skin erythema in 21 (31%) patients with a median weight loss of 3.1 kg (range: 0-16). No grade 4 toxicity was observed. Median time to relapse was 13 months; we observed only three (4%) local and four (6%) regional relapses, whereas eight (12%) patients developed distant metastases without any evidence of locoregional recurrence. The 2 years overall-, disease-free survival, and actuarial locoregional control rates were 85, 73 and 83% respectively. The reduction of the overall treatment time using postoperative accelerated RT with weekly concomitant boost (six fractions per week) is feasible with local control rates comparable to that of published data. Acute RT-related morbidity is acceptable. ","2015":"To identify SF2 as a prognostic factor of late complications from radiosurgery in patients treated for AVM. Five patients with AVM treated in three canadian institutions and who suffered clinically significant neurological sequelaes secondary to radiosurgery were identified. Their fibroblasts were cultured and their radiation sensitivity tested to determine the SF2 for each patient. Patients who developed a neurological complication from radionecrosis, secondary to radiosurgery had an SF2 different than the two control patients with AVM and no complications and also from a group of five cancer patients without late radiation complications (P = 0.005). Radiosurgery is an elective procedure. The identification of a subgroup of patients who are radiosensitive and at a higher risk of radiation induced complications can allow the treatment team to reduce the risk of such complications.

The classic schedule consists in delivering a total dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions on 5 weeks, sometimes associated with a 10 to 16 Gy boost. For elderly women with difficulties to move or for younger women having professional activity or with young children in charge, a 5 to 6 weeks radiation therapy with long and frequent transportations is sometimes difficult to achieve. The aim of partial breast irradiation (PBI) is to prevent, in a short period (5 to 8 days) and less transportations, the risk of local recurrence into the tumor bed. Different techniques have been described, using either interstitial brachytherapy (low or high dose rate) or intra-operative radiation therapy (IORT photons or electrons) or external beam radiation therapy. Phase II PBI trials using interstitial brachytherapy showed a local control rate of 0 to 4% with a follow-up of 20 to 75 months. The rate of good\/excellent cosmetic results is 67 to 100%. Results analysis of trials using very new PBI techniques (MammoSite), IORT) remains more difficult. If phase III randomized trials could confirm that PBI achieved, for selected patients, local controls equivalent to those obtain with whole breast irradiation, PBI could improve quality of life during radiation therapy, and maybe contribute to have a cost effective breast cancer conservative treatment.","2020":"Epidermal Growth Factor receptor (EGFR) are a key factor for the tumoral proliferation and its tumoral over expression appears to be a powerful prognosis factor. Currently, 2 types of treatments are targeting EGFR: a monoclonal antibodies anti-EGFR and a specific inhibitors of the EGFR tyrosine kinase. The administration of these compound alone or in combination with chemotherapy gives some promising results. These targets as anti-cancer therapy had emerged to be a new perspective for oncology.","2021":"Nasopharyngeal adenoid cystic carcinoma is a rare tumor, few cases have been reported in the literature. The aim of this report is to present a new case of an adenoid cystic carcinoma of the nasopharynx. We report the case of a 50 years-old woman presenting with an adenoid cystic carcinoma of the nasopharynx with diffuse pulmonary metastasis. The treatment combined chemotherapy, based on cisplatin and adriamycin drugs, and palliative radiation therapy at the dose of 30 Gy. The patient died 6 months after diagnosis establishment. The best treatment of adenoid cystic carcinoma is complete surgical resection but extended resection can be difficult in some locations as nasopharynx. The adjuvant radiation therapy seems to improve local control.","2022":"Muscular metatasis are rare, their number is probably underestimate. The authors report a case of a patient treated, in 1993, for a squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix. Five years later, the patient developed a metatasis to muscular psoas. She underwent combined surgical excision and adjuvant radiation therapy. The patient is alive and well 30 months after diagnosis of the metastasis.","2023":"Systemic metastases from ovarian carcinoma are frequent, but they seldom affect the central nervous system. We present here the case of a patient treated for an ovarian cancer by surgery and chemotherapy. Three months after the end of chemotherapy, the patient developed cerebral metastases from ovarian carcinoma (CMOC) treated by iterative surgery and and whole brain irradiation. As the frequency of solitary cerebral metastasis of ovarian cancer is higher than with other cancers, it is likely that they behave slightly differently. Literature analysis reveals an increase in the incidence of CMOC since the middle of the nineties. CMOC can occur during or after adjuvant chemotherapy and the best management strategies to better define determinants of survival for patients are not well known. It appears that a better outcome of CMOC may be obtained by an aggressive treatment, if possible, including surgery, radiotherapy, and chemotherapy. Taking into account the increase in the incidence of the CMOC and their early occurrence, some authors have proposed a prophylactic brain radiotherapy in patients who receive adjuvant chemotherapy.","2024":"To initiate Intensity-Modulated Radiation Therapy (IMRT) in our department, theoretical cases were used as a training, to define methods of measurements and to verify the software by comparing results of calculation and measurement on a PMMA phantom. Irradiation was performed with 6 and 25 MV X-rays from a linear accelerator. For measurements, films and ionization chambers have been chosen. The comparison between calculations and measurements shows some discrepancies at the level of junctions and also in areas of low doses especially when many segments were used. These theoretical cases provide a first step on the way towards treatments with intensity modulation.","2025":"A new technique such as intensity-modulated radiotherapy needs a quality assurance program. A French cooperative group joined to define a common program for the use of this technique in the case of head and neck carcinomas. Specific controls are necessary and even mandatory, for example: leaves position, speed of the leaves and the linearity of the dose with the monitor unit number. Measurements in homogeneous phantoms will validate calculated treatment plans. Absolute and relative measurements need ionisation chambers and films. Measurements for each beam, gantry at 0 degrees, are basic measurements. If those are impossible due to the treatment planning software, they can be performed with the treatment angles, films of course positioned perpendicularly to the beam axis. A consensus must be established between members to reduce the frequency and the number of measurements. Nevertheless, it currently seems mandatory to maintain measurements for each beam. Moreover, incidents that happen during this kind of treatment have to be recorded and new verifications will have to be realised then. This program is a unique possibility to match the application of a new technique whatever the type of equipment.","2026":"A review of the activity and techniques of total body irradiation (TBI) in France in the last 20 years is presented. In order to have on overall view of the activity and techniques of total body irradiation in France, the group of cancer centre radiation oncologists sent a questionnaire to all the cancer centres or public hospitals radiotherapy departments dealing with this treatment. Thirty-six questionnaires were sent and thirty-one departments answered. Three departments do not offer this treatment. Five departments did not answer. Results, therefore, concern the activity of the 28 departments that agreed to give detailed and clear answers. A total of 10 630 TBIs have been documented, 850 to 900 TBI have been done each year since 1995. Single fraction TBIs are used in only five centres and are being progressively abandoned. For multiple-fraction TBIs, the techniques described here are the ones used in 1999, at the time the questionnaires were sent. A majority (98%) of the teams used linear accelerators. The collected data are synthesised in tables. Nowadays, single fraction TBIs are only indicated in exceptional cases. Most of the TBIs are fractionated in six twice-daily fractions with pulmonary shielding to limit the dose between 6 and 11 Gy depending on departments' protocols and pathologies.","2027":"Intra-operative intertitial brachytherapy has been applied in the curative and palliative treatment of lung cancer. Implantation of radio-active sources offers an advantage over external irradiation because of the limited penetrability from source to prescription point, resulting in rapid dose fall-off and sparing of surrounding normal tissues. The aim of this study was to re-evaluate retrospectively the Antoine-Lacassagne cancer center experience in endobronchial brachytherapy by low dose rate (LDR) or high dose rate (HDR) and to design perspectives for the next decades. Evaluation was based on analysis of toxicities, response rates and survival. From october 1989 to june 1999, 31 consecutive patients with bronchogenic carcinoma were treated. Thirteen and 18 patients received LDR and HDR, respectively. The mean age was 65 years (range 44 to 79 years). Inclusion criteria were, for palliative treatment, incurable endobronchial cancer, and for curative treatment, residual tumor in the margins after resection, or endobronchial tumor could not be treated surgically. Exclusion criteria were sites of lesion unsuitable for placement of the brachytherapy catheter. Evaluation of complications and clinical response were based on endoscopic evaluation one month after the last session and at less one year after the end of treatment. Eighty-seven courses have been performed: 65 by LDR and 22 by HDR. Thirty-six courses have been performed in the palliative group, 51 courses in the curative group. Seven patients among 31 presented acute complications and 18\/31 late complications. Complete global response rate was 14\/30 evaluable patients (47%). Mean overall global survival was 23 months with a median follow-up of 3.5 years. These results confirm the efficacy of endobronchial brachytherapy as well as palliative or curative treatment, but the improvement of results will essentially depend on our capacity to better define our indications and underlie the necessity to perform phase III international randomised trial. ","2028":"Breast cancer rarely occurs in very young women, its diagnosis and management could sometimes be difficult. Our aim is to analyse the epidemiological and clinicopathological features of a group of very young women and especially to evaluate the results of therapeutic strategy. We report a retrospective study conducted at the department of radiotherapy in Alexis-Vautrin Centre, concerning 30 patients aged &lt; or = 30 years in whom a diagnosis of invasive breast carcinoma was made between 1986 and 2001. Six patients had familial history of breast cancer. Palpable tumor was found in 90% of cases, the average size was 3.5 cm. Eleven patients presented with stage I, 11 presented with stage II, 6 presented with stage III and 2 presented with stage IV. Five cancers were diagnosed after pregnancy (average tumor size = 5.8 cm). Eleven patients received neoadjuvant chemotherapy and 23 (82%) of 28 operable cases of invasive malignancy underwent breast conservative surgery (BCS). We found an invasive ductal carcinoma with grade III in 13\/27 cases and a nodal involvement in a half of cases, 11 patients of 26 had no expression of oestrogen receptor. The average follow-up was 5 years: six patients (20%) recurred locally (all of them were initially treated by BCS), four patients developed a contralateral breast cancer and three developed a second malignancy. Ten patients died of their metastatic disease. The 5-year overall survival rate was 78%. Our results are consistent with those of the published reports and suggest that very young women with breast cancer have a poorer prognosis compared with the older ones. They should receive, according to their prognostic factors, an appropriate regional, systemic and hormonal therapy. ","2029":"Advances in technology have initiated a process of redefinition of planning and evaluation of brachytherapy. The new approach involves conformal positioning of a source configuration for which the treatment isodose contour is adapted to the shape of the target volume which is defined by 3D dimensional imaging. A good implant aims for a balance between good coverage of the target volume, a high dose uniformity inside the target volume and a steep dose fall-off outside the target volume. Computer hardware and software is now available to obtain a high level of sophistication, for instance in treatment planning. In addition, new after loading equipment became available allowing a large variety in source placement in the catheters. To facilitate optimisation procedures, new parameters for the judgement of the quality of the implant have been suggested.","2030":"Pulse Dose Rate (PDR) brachytherapy presents the potential radiobiological advantages of low dose rate and the technical and radiation protection advantages of high dose rate remote afterloading technology. The different algorithms provided by the treatment planning systems allow dose rate and isodose shape optimization regarding the volumes defined by the radiologist and the radiation oncologist. The contribution of imaging together with these new optimization tools should improve brachytherapy practice and the therapeutic ratio. These new evolutions of brachytherapy will be presented here.","2031":"Endo-oesophageal brachytherapy became more useful, since high dose rate brachytherapy is available. This technique allowed to treat in situ tumors and also to increase radiation dose to the tumor site for lesions treated by external radiotherapy associated with chemotherapy. Most series together with ours show a trend to increase the local control rate with brachytherapy, but few of them show an impact on survival. Endo-oesophageal brachytherapy requires a very accurate technique to limit the side effects.","2032":"Endometrial adenocarcinomas rank third as tumoral sites en France. The tumors are confined to the uterus in 80% of the cases. Brachytherapy has a large place in the therapeutic strategy. The gold standard treatment remains extrafascial hysterectomy with bilateral annexiectomy and bilateral internal iliac lymph node dissection. However, after surgery alone, the rate of locoregional relapses reaches 4-20%, which is reduced to 0-5% after postoperative brachytherapy of the vaginal cuff. This postoperative brachytherapy is delivered as outpatients treatment, by 3 or 4 fractions, at high dose rate. The uterovaginal preoperative brachytherapy remains well adapted to the tumors which involve the uterine cervix. Patients presenting a localized tumor but not operable for general reasons (&lt; 10%) can be treated with success by exclusive irradiation, which associates a pelvic irradiation followed by an uterovaginal brachytherapy. A high local control of about 80-90% is obtained, a little lower than surgery, with a higher risk of late complications. Last but not least, local relapses in the vaginal cuff, or in the perimeatic area, can be treated by interstitial salvage brachytherapy, associated if possible with external beam irradiation. The local control is reached in half of the patients, but metastatic dissemination is frequent. We conclude that brachytherapy has a major role in the treatment of endometrial adenocarcinomas, in combination with surgery, or with external beam irradiation for not operable patients or in case of local relapses. It should use new technologies now available including computerized afterloaders and 3D dose calculation.","2033":"Improved local control rates have been demonstrated in retrospective studies as well as in randomised trials on brachytherapy with increasing doses to the tumour bed. The higher local control obtained by interstitial breast implants, as compared to external photon or electron beam boosts, have been mainly attributed to the higher doses actually delivered to the tumour bed by these implants for the same nominal dose as compared to external beam radiotherapy (RT). On the other hand, poor cosmesis has also been correlated with radiation dose to the breast skin (radiation teleangiectases), and breast tissue (retraction due to fibrosis), the latter depending not only on RT dose but also on the treated boost volume. For this reason, a possible benefit of interstitial implants will only be realized when the gain in local control goes together with minimal cosmetic damage. Therefore, the ballistic advantages of interstitial implants have to be maximally exploited: i.e. the treated volume should be maximally adapted to the target volume, and additional irradiation of the breast skin by the boost technique should be avoided. This paper deals in detail with the technical aspects of breast brachytherapy that seem to be relevant for high quality outcome.","2034":"To study the influence of imaging based nodal staging and local dose escalation by a high-dose-rate brachytherapy (HDR-BT) boost in the treatment of locally confined prostate cancer in terms of prostate specific antigen (PSA) recurrence-free survival (biochemical non-evidence of disease (bNED)), treatment toxicity and prognostic variables. The prospectively recorded files of 144 men aged in a median of 68 years with a mean follow-up of 8 years (60-171 months) receiving curatively intended, transrectal ultrasound guided high-dose-rate 192-iridium-brachytherapy (HDR-BT) combined with external beam radiation therapy (EBRT) for locally confined prostate cancer were analyzed. T-stages were defined by digital rectal investigation and transrectal sonography (TRUS), nodal staging was performed with computed tomography(CT)\/magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) (UICC\/AJCR 1992). Twenty-nine patients (20.1%) had T1b-T2a tumors, and 115 patients had T2b-T3 tumors. Median initial PSA (iPSA) was 12.15 ng x mL(-1) (mean 25.61 ng x mL(-1)). The total planned dose applied by external beam radiation was 50 Gy in the pelvis, and 40 Gy in the prostate by in-field-dose modification by individual compensators. The perineal, TRUS guided HDR-BT was delivered in two fractions of 15 Gy each. The target of BT boost was the peripheral zone of the prostate. The overall survival was 71.5% and that of the disease free survival 82.6%. Freedom from distant metastases in T3 stage was 91.3%, whereas for G3 lesions, it was 88.23%. The bNED rate was 72.9%. Regarding treatment related late toxicity according to the EORTC\/RTOG score, we observed grade 1, 2, 3 proctitis in 9.72%, 6.94%, 4.10% as well as grade 1, 2, 3 cystitis in 12.5%, 4.16%, 2.08%, respectively. Grade 4 and 5 proctitis or cystitis were not registered. The minimum 5-year and mean 8-year results confirm that local dose escalation by TRUS guided perineal HDR-BT and complementary external beam radiation of the pelvic lymphatics has curative potential in men with locally confined high-risk prostate cancer, although surgical staging results in the literature suggest a high probabilityof microscopic nodal involvements at the level of 25.61 ng x mL(-1) mean PSA. The influence of additional short-term (&lt; 6 months) hormonal ablation on the treatment results could not be stated. ","2035":"Post-implant CT-based dosimetry is the only method of assessing the quality of permanent prostate brachytherapy. As a consequence of our permanent feedback with the preplanned technique, geometric and dosimetric criteria for optimal seed implantation are proposed and pre and post-implantation dosimetric results are presented. In 2000 and 2001, one hundred and twenty patients with early stage prostate cancer were treated with transperineal I-125 preplanned brachytherapy (RAPID Strand, Amersham Health). The prescription dose was 145 Gy to the planning target volume. For the pre-planning and post-implant dosimetry the Variseed 6.7 version software was used (Varian Medical Systems). The D90, V100 and V150 values, the position of the dose peak [Dose] peak) and the full width at half maximum (FWHM) on differential dose volume histogram from both planned and post-implant dosimetry were compared for all patients. For preplanned dosimetry, the mean values for D90, V100, V150, [Dose] peak, FWMH were respectively of 199Gy, 100%, 70%, 220Gy, 113Gy. For post-implantation, these values became respectively of 157Gy, 90%, 62%, 220Gy, 194Gy. In our practice, differences are noted between preplanned and post-implant dosimetry parameters that should be anticipated to assure optimal definitive result. A working methodology both for performing the preplanned dosimetry and for evaluating the post-implantation dosimetric results is proposed. ","2036":"Volume is an important parameter of radiation therapy. Local control is inversely related to tumor size and the complication rate increases with the importance of the irradiated volume. Although the effect of irradiated volume has been widely reported since the beginning of radiotherapy, it has been less studied than other radiation parameters such as dose, fractionation, or treatment duration. One of the first organ system in which the adverse effect of increased volume was well defined is the skin. Over the last twenty years, numerous mathematical models have been developed for different organs. In this report we will discuss the relation between irradiated volume and tumor control. In a second article we will study the impact of irradiated volume on radiation adverse effects.","2037":"Soft tissue sarcomas are rare tumors with a high risk or local recurrence and a risk of distant metastases. Standard treatment advocated is the combination of conservative resection and external radiotherapy. Brachytherapy is an integrated part of the multidisciplinary treatment. Brachytherapy can increase local control with good functional results. Primary exclusive brachytherapy has been used and is effective and safe in high grade sarcomas (randomized trial of MSKCC). Brachytherapy seems to be important as part of the treatment of central localization (shoulder, groin) and sarcomas with positive resection margins, but its relation with external radiotherapy has to be defined. Brachytherapy used with special guidelines allows to obtain an improved local control with an acceptable level of complication.","2038":"Experience accumulated over several decades with radiation of Head and Neck tumours by irradiation has demonstrated the need for a high tumour dose to achieve local control. With external beam irradiation alone, it is difficult to spare adjacent normal tissues, resulting in undesirable late effects on the salivary glands, mandible, and muscles of mastication. Interstitial implantation is ideally suited to deliver a high dose limited to the volume of the primary tumor, thus minimizing sequels. A large experience has been accumulated with low dose rate (LDR) brachytherapy in treatment of carcinoma of oral cavity, oropharynx, and nasopharynx. Recent analysis of large clinical series provided data indicating that modalities of low dose rate brachytherapy should be optimized in treating these tumors for increasing therapeutic ratio. Low dose rate brachytherapy is now challenged by high dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy and pulsed dose rate (PDR) brachytherapy. Preliminary results obtained with these two last modalities are discussed regarding to those of low dose rate brachytherapy.","2039":null,"2040":null,"2041":"The endobronchial brachytherapy procedure involves the insertion of an afterloading catheter into bronchus in close proximity to an endoluminal lesion, and to perform limited irradiation sparing as much as possible normal health tissues. The catheter is inserted during a classical flexible bronchoscopy. Three types of indications have been discussed: (i) palliative treatment of lung carcinoma, with or without laser desobstruction: an improvement in respiratory symptoms was observed in 60 to 80% of the cases; (ii) curative treatment for localised endobronchial carcinomas, in previously irradiated patients, or in case of contraindication of surgery or external beam irradiation; local control rate range from 60 to 70% at 2 years; (iii) combination of external irradiation and brachytherapy in the first line treatment of lung cancers. Two randomised trials did not show any improvement in survival for this approach; however, they have included advanced diseases. In the opposite, this association seems very effective for early stage lung carcinomas. Two major complications were regularly reported, haemoptysis and radiation bronchitis. Predictive factors for these toxicities are actually better known: haemoptysis could be due to a progressive disease more often than to brachytherapy itself; technical factors (dose, volume, fractionation), however, could explain a number of radiation bronchitis, and their incidence could decrease in the future.","2042":"Conservative treatment of small anal canal and low rectal cancers is a valid alternative to radical surgery through combinated strategies including external beam and\/or intracavitary irradiation, concomitant chemotherapy and 192 iridium implantation as a booster dose. Feasibility, tolerance and results are effective. Local control of the disease and the quality of the anal functions are good. The treatment requires great care in patient selection and follow-up.","2043":"To review the radiotherapy department experience in treating primary spinal cord ependymomas (PSCE), analyse prognostic factors and provide treatment recommendations regarding literature review. Sixteen patients with PSCE received postoperative radiotherapy between 1972 and 1997. There were 10 male and 6 female patients with a mean age of 34 years (range 2-63). Surgery was gross total resection in 2 cases, subtotal resection in 9, biopsy in 4 and of unknown type in one patient. All patients were treated with radiotherapy to the craniospinal axis (4 cases), spinal cord (1 case) and to the site of primary tumour in 11 cases. Five year-survival rate was 73%. Two patients had recurrent tumours within the primary site. Gender, extent of surgery and treatment field extent were not prognostic factors. Histologic type was the only variable predictive of outcome. Patients with myxopapillary type had a 5-year survival rate of 100% compared with 47% for those with other histology types. We conclude that aggressive surgery is not necessary in the management of PSCE, localised field radiotherapy is associated with favourable outcome, and tumour grade is an important prognostic factor. ","2044":"To study different methods of CT and MR images fusion in patient treated by brachytherapy for localized prostate cancer. To compare the results of the dosimetric study realized on CT slices and images fusion. Fourteen cases of patients treated by I125 were retrospectively studied. The CT examinations were realized with contiguous section of 5mm thickness, and MR images were obtained with a surface coil with contiguous section of 3 mm thickness. For the images fusion process, only the T2 weighted MR sequence was used. Two processes of images fusion were realized for each patient, using as reference marks the bones of the pelvis and the implanted seeds. A quantitative and qualitative appreciation was made by the operators, for each patient and both methods of images fusion. The dosimetric study obtained by a dedicated software was realized on CT images and all types of images fusion. The usual dosimetric indexes (D90, V100 and V150) were compared for each type of image. The quantitative results given by the software of images fusion showed a superior accuracy to the one obtained by the pelvic bony reference marks. Conversely, qualitative and quantitative results obtained by the operators showed a better accuracy of the images fusion based on iodine seeds. For two patients out of three presenting a D90 inferior to 145 Gy on CT examination, the D90 was superior to this norm when the dosimetry was based on images fusion, whatever the method used. The images fusion method based on implanted seed matching seems to be more precise than the one using bony reference marks. The dosimetric study realized on images fusion could allow to rectify possible errors, mainly due to difficulties in surrounding prostate contour delimitation on CT images. ","2045":"The main objective of this prospective multicenter randomised phase III study was to compare a combined regimen of fotemustine plus whole brain irradiation versus fotemustine alone in terms of cerebral response and time to cerebral progression in patients with melanoma brain metastases. Seventy-six patients (instead of the 106 planned patients; study was stopped after the interim analysis) were randomised receiving either fotemustine (arm A, n = 39) or fotemustine and whole brain irradiation (arm B, n = 37). Fotemustine was administered intravenously at 100 mg m(-2) on day 1, 8 and 15, followed by a 5-week rest period, then every 3 weeks in non-progressive patients. In arm B, a concomitant whole brain irradiation was performed at the total dose of 37.5 Gy (2.5 Gy\/d(-1), days 1-5, 3 consecutive weeks). Although patients who received fotemustine alone had worse prognostic factors, there was no significant difference in brain response (arm A: 7.4%, B: 10.0%) or control rates (objective response plus stable disease) after seven weeks (arm A: 30%, B: 47%) and overall survival (arm A: 86d, B: 105d). However, there was a significant difference in favour of arm B for the time to brain progression (p = 0.028, Wilcoxon test). Fotemustine plus whole brain irradiation delayed the time to brain progression of melanoma cerebral metastases compared to fotemustine alone but without a significant improvement in terms of objective control or overall survival. ","2046":"Many specialists are acting for psychological support: oncologists, psychologists, psychiatrists. Their respective role and the necessary good adjustment between actors are discussed. Quantitative requirements depends on number of patients and dispersion of medical units. The insufficient number of oncological staff cannot be compensated by the psycho-oncological team whose action is complementary of the technical staff support. The psycho-oncological team may be integrated in the oncology unit or autonomous. A network organisation is still uncommon. The intervention of external units of psychiatry, not specialised in oncology, is a less satisfying solution. Actually, 25% of the 94 French centres have neither psychiatrist nor psychologist. The same investigation has shown that 20% of patients request a consultation with a psychiatrist or a psychologist, but only half of them obtain it. There is also a need of formation as well for psychiatrists and psychologists as for oncologists. All that is necessary to satisfy the demand of support of patients and of their family.","2047":"Psycho-oncology is exercised daily in the cancerological care in concert with other practices. It is one of the component of the pluridiscinarity. Preventive actions towards patients and loved ones result from this practice as well as the unrelenting seeking of psychological difficulties. In addition, psycho-oncology enhances the coordination of patients care. Integrated to the \"supportive care\" it allows a better understanding of the psychosocial dimension in the decision process. Constant collaboration with other medical practitioners ensures awareness and a reciprocal training, which are at the core of the care relationship.","2048":"This paper reports the patient care experience during the course of the radiotherapy. Plights are multiple. Patients are confronted with a complex and unknown distressing space, an irrelavant information, a banalization of side effects, an isolation with a frequent inadequate support of their family or the caregivers team, with the fear of a definitive abandonment at the end of the treatment without comforting follow-up. It is imperative to state a real policy in order to improve the patient support. Sensibilization and training of the caregivers, in spite of a frequent overbooking technical work, is required in a pluridisciplinary approach to provide a relevant reception with the collaboration of psychologists, social workers and self care groups and associations. The personal implication of the physicians and technologists is also essential. The simple smile is the intangible proof of the reliable emotional support.","2049":"Brachytherapy consists of sealed radioactive source implantation. The diversity in the nature of radioelements, in their energy and activity requires strict implantation and utilization rules. These rules include radioactive source physical parameters check, after-loading machine and treatment planning system quality assurance and safe and reproducible dosimetric systems. Patient and medical workers information guarantee radioprotection and prevention of accidental exposures.","2050":"The development of computerized systems in radiotherapy opens new challenging possibilities. There is however a major risk of specific errors if the use of such systems is not properly controlled. On the other hand, the software sophistication, such as encountered in modern treatment planning systems (TPS), makes it very difficult to set up efficient quality assurance programs compatible with the workload of users in charge of daily routine. From the analysis of previous accidents involving TPS, we can conclude that the major risks are erroneous calculations of monitor units resulting from a poor understanding of the software capabilities combined to a lack of vigilance with respect to the data obtained from a computer. To reduce the risks, it is necessary to setup a comprehensive quality assurance program covering all steps of the process, including commissioning of a new system and systematic checks of individual treatment plans. Such a program offers the users the opportunity to acquire a deeper understanding of the system and avoid potential pitfalls. There is presently a lack of consensus for an international protocol related to quality assurance of computerized systems in radiotherapy. It is therefore important to define protocols at the national level, with special consideration of the aspects which are more likely to generate significant errors.","2051":"Due to the modifications of components, to unexpected breakage of elements or to electronic dysfunctions, the performance of radiotherapy machines may decrease with age. Quality Assurance procedures and maintenance program are necessary to guarantee the performances. For linear accelerators, modus operandi of control tests and their frequency are based on regulations and recommendations widely published, that are presented here. Concerning accessories, especially those recently developed (multileaf collimators, dynamic wedges, ...), recommendations remains to be defined. Simple tests are proposed. Concerning numerical imaging systems, widely used for three dimensional dosimetry, image quality and geometry controls must be performed with phantom tests. For portal imaging, a quality assurance program is proposed. A strict and complete Quality Assurance program is essential to guarantee quality and safety of the treatment. A regular control of linear accelerator is one of the important component of this program. It suppose the implementation of permanent tests procedures, periodically modified following technological progresses and treatment techniques. Measurements must be sensible to variations below the tolerance level defined during the installation process. The analysis of the variations of measurements with time are an objective criterion of quality.","2052":"Radiotherapy accidents are exceedingly rare. However, they may have major negative consequences: for health (and sometimes life) of victims as well as for the trust that patients put in radiotherapy and radiation oncologists. Each accident must be pointed out, analysed and reported, in order to allow preventive actions, avoiding repetitive accidents. Through examples of majors accidents occurred all over the world in the last decades, affecting professionals, public or patients themselves, the necessity of transparency is demonstrated. The International Commission of Radiobiological Protection has drawn positive lessons from such accidents and insists on following recommendations: necessity of sufficient number and competent professionals, importance of continuous and initial education, information of professionals and, in general, a strict Quality Assurance program. It is clear that each radiotherapy center remains at risk for errors. It is essential to develop preventive procedures to avoid transformation of errors into accidents. In that context, complete and detailed description and reports of each anomaly or incident must be encouraged as it is done for sectors of aviation or nuclear industry. Radiation oncology must develop such a culture of transparency and of systematic report of all incidents.","2053":"Radiotherapy is aimed at getting the best possible therapeutic ratio (tumor local control versus morbidity). Physicists and radiation oncologists have to evaluate explicitly or implicitly the probability of induced complications to normal surrounding tissues. This is based on published data and clinician's experience. Quantitative methods have been introduced with different models in order to predict the impact of partial or global irradiation on a normal organ. These models correspond to the Tumor Control Probability (TCP) and Normal Tissue Complication Probability (NTCP). These biological models may be useful to evaluate the quality of a treatment planning or for the optimization process. The methodologies used and the clinical data are developed and discussed.","2054":"Stereotactic radiosurgery is used for treating several brain diseases. Radiosurgery is a non-invasive alternative to surgery for brain metastases, and randomized trials are on going to assess the role of radiosurgery. Radiosurgery has been advocated for patients with small benign meningioma or with vestibular schwannoma, but there is no proof of efficacy and safety of radiosurgery in comparison with other treatments. Radiosurgery can obliterate 80-90% of small arteriovenous malformations, but no information exists on the survival of treated compared with untreated patients. The limited information available suggests that radiosurgery should be fully evaluated in well-designed prospective studies.","2055":"Three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3D CRT) is adversely affected by setup error and organ motion. In thoracic 3D CRT, breathing accounts for most of intra-fraction movements, thus impairing treatment quality. Breath control clearly exhibits dosimetric improvement compared to free breathing, leading to various techniques for gated treatments. We review benefits of different breath control methods--i.e. breath-holding or beam gating, with spirometric, isometric or X-ray respiration sensor--and argument the choice of expiration versus inspiration, with consideration to dosimetric concerns. All steps of 3D-CRT can be improved with breath control. Contouring of organs at risk (OAR) and target are easier and more accurate on breath controlled CT-scans. Inter- and intra-fraction target immobilisation allows smaller margins with better coverage. Lung outcome predictors (NTCP, Mean Dose, LV20, LV30) are improved with breath-control. In addition, inspiration breath control facilitates beam arrangement since it widens the distance between OAR and target, and leaves less lung normal tissue within the high dose region. Last, lung density, as of CT-scan, is more accurate, improving dosimetry. Our institution's choice is to use spirometry driven, patient controlled high-inspiration breath-hold; this technique gives excellent immobilization results, with high reproducibility, yet it is easy to implement and costs little extra treatment time. Breath control, whatever technique is employed, proves superior to free breathing treatment when using 3D-CRT. Breath control should then be used whenever possible, and is probably mandatory for IMRT.","2056":"The conformal radiotherapy approach, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) and intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), is based on modern imaging modalities, efficient 3D treatment planning systems, sophisticated immobilization devices and demanding quality assurance and treatment verification. The main goal of conformal radiotherapy is to ensure a high dose distribution tailored to the limits of the target volume while reducing exposure of healthy tissues. These techniques would then allow a further dose escalation increasing local control and survival. Non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is one of the most difficult malignant tumors to be treated. It combines geometrical difficulties due to respiratory motion, and number of low tolerance neighboring organs, and dosimetric difficulties because of the presence of huge inhomogeneities. This localization is an attractive and ambitious example for the evaluation of new techniques. However, the published clinical reports in the last years described very heterogeneous techniques and, in the absence of prospective randomized trials, it is somewhat difficult at present to evaluate the real benefits drawn from those conformal radiotherapy techniques. After reviewing the rationale for 3DCRT for NSCLC, this paper will describe the main studies of 3DCRT, in order to evaluate its impact on lung cancer treatment. Then, the current state-of-the-art of IMRT and the last technical and therapeutic innovations in NSCLC will be discussed.","2057":"Lung cancer is the most frequent form of malignant tumours. The prognosis is poor with a 5-year cure rate which increased from approximately 6% in the sixties to only 15% in the nineties. Surgery remains the reference treatment but only a small minority of patients (about 25%) present with operable disease. The post-surgical 5-year survival is only 25%, providing the rationale for the current research on adjuvant treatments for control of both local and metastatic disease. In that context, the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, commonly referred to as chemo-radiotherapy, has assumed considerable importance: either exclusively in inoperable patients (inoperable tumour or patients inoperable for medical reasons), or pre-operatively. This article reviews the results of the pivotal definitive chemoradiotherapy studies in non-metastatic non-small-cell lung cancer. With exclusive chemoradiation, the concomitant scheme seems to be the most favourable, results issued from randomised studies are expected to confirm that point. An increased toxicity is observed, and the advent of conformal therapy may allow another survival gain. Optimal treatments integration will be necessary.","2058":"Two randomized trials, in 1994, have demonstrated the benefit of neoadjuvant chemotherapy, in term of median survival, for stage III lung cancer. Further studies have evaluated the potential benefit of chemotherapy or chemotherapy-radiotherapy association, either for patients suitable for surgery, or for non resectables tumors. However, these treatments treatments may increase the morbidity of surgery. Such an increase has not been demonstrated, except in one study, after chemotherapy alone before surgery. When radiation therapy is associated with pre-operative chemotherapy, the risk of complications seems to be dose dependent: low for doses below 50 Gy, important for doses over 55 Gy. These datas justify pre-operative lung function measurements and modifications of the surgical technic, especially for the lymphadenectomy extension. Despite this potential increase of morbidity, the benefit of neoadjuvant treatment is real.","2059":"The very disappointing results obtained by surgery in resectable non-small-cell lung cancer have led to a high active clinical research concerning pre- or postoperative treatment. Preoperative treatment has several distincts goals: to increase survival for patients suitable for surgery, to limit surgery or transform borderline or non resectable cancer into resectable tumors. Available datas on preoperative treatments for non-small-cell lung cancer provide from three types of therapeutics trials: 1\/Some phase II studies of neoadjuvant chemotherapy have demonstrated that the neoadjuvant approach was feasible, and didn't compromise surgery. 2\/Phase II trials of neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy, performed for the majority on more extensive cancers, have demonstrated that this approach was also feasible at the expense of higher but still tolerable toxicity. 3\/Phase III randomised published trials exclusively deal with preoperative chemotherapy with different results: two of them concerned a small number of patients presenting with non-small-cell lung stage IIIA cancer: they are positive. The third concerned 373 patients presenting with stage I, II, IIIA cancer: the three-year survival was increased by 11%, but this difference is not yet significant. The benefit essentially appeared for stage I and II. One trial comparing preoperative chemotherapy and radiochemotherapy has been reported, concluding to the superiority of the association. These observations suggest that the clinical research should now be different for stages I and II, and stage IIIA.","2060":"Preoperative radiotherapy is the standard treatment for locally advanced resectable rectal adenocarcinoma. The total mesorectal excision leads to a dramatic increase of local control rate. Thus, the mesorectal space is the usual field for the spread of rectal cancers cells. It could therefore be considered as the clinical target volume (CTV) in the preoperative conformational radiotherapy. From the anatomical basis and radiological contributions, we propose several CTVs for different locations of rectal carcinoma.","2061":"The delineation of target volume and organs at risk depends on the organs definition, and on the modalities for the CT-scan acquisition. Inter-observer variability in the delineation may be large, especially when patient's anatomy is unusual. During the two french multicentric studies of conformal radiotherapy for localized prostate cancer, it was made an effort to harmonize the delineation of the target volumes and organs at risk. Two cases were proposed for delineation during two workshops. In the first case, the mean prostate volume was 46.5 mL (extreme: 31.7-61.3), the mean prostate and seminal vesicles volume was 74.7 mL (extreme: 59.6-80.3), the rectal and bladder walls varied respectively in proportion from 1 to 1.45 and from 1 to 1.16; in the second case, the mean prostate volume was 53.1 mL (extreme: 40.8-73.1), the volume of prostate plus seminal vesicles was 65.1 mL (extreme: 53.2-89), the rectal wall varied proportionally from 1 to 1, 24 and the vesical wall varied from 1 to 1.67. For participating centers to the french studies of dose escalation, a quality control of contours was performed to decrease the inter-observer variability. The ways to reduce the discrepancies of volumes delineation, between different observers, are discussed. A better quality of the CT images, use of urethral opacification, and consensual definition of clinical target volumes and organs at risk may contribute to that improvement.","2062":"The computerized tomography (CT) used for target volumes contouring is an essential step of the radiotherapy process. The CT technical factors must be adapted to explored organs and anatomic regions: data acquisition parameters and reconstruction algorithm, digestive or intravenous contrast. The choice of these parameters and its consequences for contouring are discussed. Respiratory motion must be considered for some organs. Helical CT allow a data acquisition during one apnoea. Knowledge of these technical factors is essential for good contouring and for the future use of multiple row detectors. Precise exams protocols depending on lesions, on treatment methods and patients are demanded. Close cooperation between radiation oncologists, physicists and radiologists is not only a wish but becomes a necessity.","2063":"Surgical pathology analysis of biopsies or surgical specimens directly determines the diagnosis of the disease. It gives also the different characteristics that are useful for the establishment of the prognosis and for the treatment of each tumor. We report here a synthesis of the different characteristics of neoplastic lesions, necessary or useful for the establishment of the care program of the patients. These macroscopic and microscopic analyses should result in the most precise possible diagnosis and should take into account a list of other factors that allow the development of an optimal strategy for therapy, and the establishment of prognosis of the tumor. These characteristics include properties of the tumor like the size, shape, exact location, and the grade of the lesion, etc. They also concern the relationship of the tumor with certain structures like the basal membranes, the extracapsular extensions, the stroma reaction, the lymphatic vessels, the nerves, etc. The description of local and loco-regional spreading, as well as the analysis of the surgical margins gives also essential information. Sometimes, the description of modifications induced by neoadjuvant therapy, as chemo or radiotherapy, allows the evaluation of the efficiency of these treatments.","2064":"Target volume delineation remains an important medical step for conformal radiotherapy. In this general presentation are discussed: the main difficulties for evaluation of gross tumor (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV), the main recommendations for representation according to ICRU 62 report, differences observed during inter-observer volume comparisons.","2065":"The conformal radiotherapy approach, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) or intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), is based on modern imaging modalities, efficient 3D treatment planning systems, sophisticated immobilization systems and rigorous quality assurance and treatment verification. The central objective of conformal radiotherapy is to ensure a high dose distribution tailored to the limits of the target volume while reducing exposure of normal tissues. These techniques would then allow further tumor dose escalation. Head-and-neck tumors are some of the most attractive localizations to test conformal radiotherapy. They combine ballistic difficulties due to particularly complex shapes (nasopharynx, ethmoid) and problems due to the number and low tolerance of neighbouring organs like parotids, eyes, brainstem and spinal cord. The therapeutic irradiation of head-and-neck tumors thus remains a challenge for the radiation oncologist. Conformal radiotherapy does have a significant potential for improving local control and reducing toxicity when compared to standard radiotherapy. However, in the absence of prospective randomized trials, it is somewhat difficult at present to evaluate the real benefits drawn from 3DCRT and IMRT. The published clinical reports on the use of conformal radiotherapy are essentially dealing with dosimetric comparisons on relatively small numbers of patients. Recently, a few publications have emphasized the clinical experience of several precursor teams with a suitable follow-up. This paper describes the current state-of-the-art of 3DCRT and IMRT in order to evaluate the impact of these techniques on head-and-neck cancers irradiation.","2066":"At Ghent University Hospital, IMRT for head and neck cancer is routinely performed. The desired dose distribution is defined upfront as a range of acceptable doses assigned to each voxel of volumes of interest. It was found important to specify the range of acceptable doses separately to areas of the PTV either in or outside the buildup zone as well as to areas which do or do not intersect with PTV-dose limiting organs at risk (OAR). To avoid high doses at distance from the PTV, the creation of a \"surrounding\" OAR which is the whole scanned volume minus the PTV was found efficient, especially if inside this OAR, subvolumes were created at increasing distance from the PTV. By specifying inside these subvolumes maximum dose constraints which decreased with distance from the PTV, conformality is secured. The creation of these additional PTV and OAR subvolumes allows comprehensive and unambiguous definition of the range of acceptable doses and thereby avoids user-interactive assignment of weights to the terms of the objective function during optimization. The efficiency of inverse planning is highly improved. Its outcome is predictable, plan evaluation is objective as the plan either does or does not comply with the predefined range of acceptable doses. Accurate reporting of the planned dose distribution is facilitated by description of the dose range to all volumes. The expense of this procedure is modest and lays mostly 1) in the creation of the subvolumes, which can be done semi-automatically by modern image segmentation tools and 2) in the inclusion of constraints to all subvolumes into the objective function.","2067":"Improvement in irradiation techniques, which allows dose distributions sculpting around volumes of very complex shapes, has revealed the limitations in selection and delineation of target volumes. The use of functional imaging (PET, fMRI) in addition to anatomic imaging, will probably bring an extra level of complexity to this issue. In particular, the use of specific markers to visualize biological pathways known to influence response to ionizing radiation (e.g. hypoxia, proliferation) could lead to the delineation of sub-target volumes for delivering an extra boost dose. Such concept of Image-Guided Radiation Therapy still need to be tested in experimental models and in well defined clinical situations before its use in a routine clinical set-up.","2068":"In the past few years, new agents based on monoclonal antibodies have been developed in Oncology. Indeed in some case tumor cells express antigenic targets at higher levels than normal cells. There are 2 main types of monoclonal antibodies that can be either conjugated to cytotoxic drugs or radio-active compounds or be non-conjugated. Among the last category, some are currently used in the treatment of patients, including 2 monoclonal antibodies targeting receptors with tyrosine kinase activity (HER2: Herceptin (DCI: trastuzumab), EGFr: Erbitux (DCI: cetuximab). A third monoclonal antibody is commonly used in cancer treatment, which targets CD20, a transmembrane marker of B lymphoma (MabThera (DCI: rituximab). Both Herceptin and MabThera have been associated with improved survival in patients with breast carcinoma and lymphoma, respectively. New promising agents are under investigation such anti EGFr in colon and head and neck carcinoma or new compounds such as anti-VEGF. These examples outline the importance of the recent progress in selectively targeting tumor antigen and the potential impact of these approaches in Oncology.","2069":"Frequency of local and distant failures after gastrectomy has led to extended lymph nodes dissection to obtain a better locoregional control. However, five year survival rates were not significantly different between patients undergoing D2 and D1 lymphadenectomy, and higher morbidity and post operative deaths were reported in large randomised trials (respectively 25% vs 48% and 4 vs 13%). Additionally, several metanalysis failed to demonstrate a significant survival advantage with adjuvant chemotherapy. The results of the first trial demonstrating one advantage to adjuvant post-operative chemoradiotherapy should modify the standard care. Disease free and overall survival after surgery alone and after surgery and concurrent chemoradiotherapy were respectively 31% vs 48% and 41% vs 50%. The intergroup trial demonstrate that better local control improve survival if radiation fields include stamps, tumour bed, proximal nodal chains and nodes corresponding to D2 extended lymph nodes dissection. Treatment was feasible with few severe toxic effects (1%). Of the 281 patients, 17% stopped treatment because toxic effects. Technical modalities of radiotherapy and post-operative nutrition support, which are critical points of interest for this treatment, are also discussed.","2070":null,"2071":"Primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast is a rare neoplasma included in metaplastic breast cancer. The histogenesis remains unknown. Clinical and radiological appearances are not specific. Nodal involvement is rare and hormones receptors are negative. The treatment is based on surgery associated to radiation therapy and chemotherapy. Prognosis seems to be similar to others breast carcinoma. We report three cases of primary squamous cell carcinoma of the breast recruited at National Institute of Oncology with review of the literature.","2072":null,"2073":"Primary adenocarcinoma of the male urethra is very uncommon, accounts for 5% of primary urethral cancers. All types of urethral carcinomas account for less than 1% of urinary malignancies in man. The prognosis remains poor despite the wide surgical treatment. The place of chemotherapy combined with radiotherapy must be defined by other studies. We report a case of primary locally advanced adenocarcinoma arising in the bulbo-membranous urethra. The patient was 29 years old, without any previous history of venerian disease. He was treated by combined external beam radiotherapy (total dose 67Gy) and chemotherapy (Cisplatinum). A marked reduction of tumor volume has been noted but the patient died because of the appearance of bone metastasis which failed to the systemic therapy.","2074":"Two pregnant patients received radiation therapy, one for the treatment of mediastinal Hodgkin's lymphoma and the other for a head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. The fetuses were both protected by additional shielding which reduced the unshielded exposure of the first fetus by 20-40%, and that of the second by 20-60%. The first child received an estimated maximum dose of 42 cGy, the second a maximum dose of 9 cGy. Treatment details are reported and a review of the literature that addresses the possible irradiation-induced side effects at low doses is included.","2075":"Male breast cancer is rare; it constitutes 0.2-1.5% of all malignant tumours in men and 1% of all breast cancers. The goal of this retrospective study is to analyse the epidemiologic, clinic, therapeutic and evolutive profiles of this disease in 71 cases collected at the National Institute of Oncology in Rabat, Morocco, between the years 1985 and 1998. The median age was 60 years. No significant risk factor was found. The average consultation's delay was 35 months. The main clinical complaint was a mass beneath the areola in 86% of the cases, associated with ulceration in 18% of the cases. For that, the disease was diagnosed at an advanced stage. Infiltrating ductal carcinoma was the most frequent pathologic type (91.5% of cases). Management consisted especially of radical mastectomy, followed by adjuvant radiotherapy and hormonal therapy with or without chemotherapy. It was possible to follow 58 of the patients. The median of follow-up was 30 months. The evolution has been characterized by local recurrence, after a median delay of 36 months, in five cases (8.5% of all patients). Metastasis occurred, after a median delay of 12 months, in 14 cases (24% of all patients). The site of metastasis was the bone in six cases, lung in five cases, liver in one case, liver and skin in one case and pleura and skin in one case. There were three cases of death. In one case, death was related to lung metastases. In the two remaining cases, death was due to comorbid disease. Progression was observed in one case.","2076":"Purpose- There is a relationship between the local control rate of the nasopharyngeal cancer and the total dose delivered within the tumoral volume. In contrast, the relation between the dose and the irradiated volume and the risk of complication is not clearly defined. That is why, in patients presenting with a locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer, we compared the dose-volume distribution of irradiated tissues, obtained from two 3D conformal irradiation techniques. Patients and methods- Between January 2000 and June 2001, 5 patients, 3 males and 2 females, with a median age of 32 years and presenting with a T4N0M0 nasopharyngeal cancer received a chemoradiotherapy. Radiotherapy combined photons and protons beams and the platin-based chemotherapy was delivered in three intravenous injections at d1, 22, 43 of the irradiation. To calculate the dosimetry, a CT scan and a MRI were performed in all the patients. The gross tumor volume (GTV) was delineated from the imagery, three clinical tumor volumes were defined, the CTV1 was the GTV and the whole nasopharynx, the CTV2 was the CTV plus a 10 mm-margin and the CTV3 was the CTV2 and the nodes areas (cervical and subclavicular). Prophylactic dose within node areas was 44 Gy. Prescribed doses within CTV2 and GTV or CTV1 were 54 Gy\/CGE (Cobalt Gy Equivalent, for an EBR = 1,1) and 70 Gy\/CGE, respectively. Irradiation was delivered with fractions of 1.8 or 2.0 Gy\/CGE, with 44 Gy or 54 Gy by photons and with 16 or 26 CGE by protons. According to dose-volume histograms obtained from the dosimetry planning by protons and photons and from the theoretical dosimetry by photons lonely, for the different volumes of interest, GTV, CTV2, and organs at risk (optic nerves, chiasm, internal ears, brainstem, temporal lobes), we compared the averages of the maximum, minimum and mean doses and the averages of the volumes of organs of interest encompassed by different isodoses.Results- Calculated averages of minimum, maximum and mean doses delivered within GTV were superior for the treatment with combined photons and protons than with photons alone. The average GTV encompassed by the 70 Gy\/CGE isodose was larger by 65% with the association compared to photons alone. The conformation ratio (tissue volume encompassed by the 95% isodose\/GTV encompassed by the 95% isodose) was 3.1 with the association compared to 5.7 with photons alone. For the CTV2, there were no differences in different criteria according to the both irradiation techniques. For the critical, radiosensitive organs, the comparison of the majority of the criteria was in favour of the association of protons and photons. Overall, 78% of the criteria were in favour of the association.Conclusion- For locally advanced nasopharyngeal cancer without clinical adenopathy, irradiation by photons and protons increases the tumor volume irradiated at the prescribed dose and decreases the volume or critical organs irradiated and the total dose delivered within them.","2077":"The influence of thermoplastic masks used in clinical routine for patient immobilization in head and neck radiotherapy treatment on the absorbed skin dose has been investigated at Gustave-Roussy Institute. The measurements were performed in 60Co gamma-rays, 4 and 6MV X-rays and in 8 and 10MeV electron beams. Initially, the measurements were performed with thermoluminescent dosimeters (LiF) and a NACP chamber on a polystyrene phantom in order to study the influence of physical parameters (distance, field size, energy...) on first millimeters depth variation dose. The study was completed with in vivo measurements on 14 patients using various dosimeters (thermoluminescent detectors, diodes) in order to assess the increase of dose on first millimeters depth and to verify the delivered dose during treatment sessions (quality control). In treatment conditions, masks lead to an important increase of dose on the first millimeter in 60Co gamma-rays beams (dose value normalized to maximum of dose increase from 57.1% to 77.7% for 0.5 mm-water depth and from 78.5% to 88% for 1 mm-water depth); its contribution is less important in 4 and 6 MV X-rays beams (dose value normalized to maximum of dose increase from 49.5% to 63.2% for 0.5 mm-water depth and from 59% to 70.1% for 1 mm-water depth). Concerning 8 and 10 MeV electron beams, the normalized dose value increase respectively from 78.4% to 81.7% and from 82.2% to 86.1% for 0.5 mm-water depth. In vivo dosimetry enabled the quality control of delivered dose during treatment. Measured dose is in agreement within +\/- 5% with the prescribed dose for 92.3% of cases. In routine, in vivo dosimetry allowed to quantify the increase of skin dose induced by thermoplastic masks for various energies of photon and electron beams as well as quality control.","2078":"Since January 2001, radiotherapy treatments with modulated intensity beams (IMRT) have started at the Centre Oscar-Lambret. This paper presents the tests and measurements made before the clinical implementation as well the quality control performed before each routine treatment. We use the treatment planning system Helax-TMS (MDS-Nordion) and the Primus accelerator (Siemens) linked to the Lantis network with Primeview and Simtec modules (Siemens) allowing to deliver intensity modulated beams with Step-and-Shoot technique. A prostate case and a head and neck case have been studied and have permitted to evaluate the benefit of IMRT compared to a \"classical\" conformal radiotherapy. In a second time, we have tested the accelerator's capabilities to deliver these intensity modulated beams, id-est, the accuracy of the leaf positions and the linearity of the monitor chamber. The third step has been the verification of the dose distributions calculated by Helax-TMS, id-est, the dose for different segment sizes, the dose profiles for an intensity modulated beam and the dose distribution for all the traitment beams. The used phantom has been especially developed at the Centre Oscar-Lambret for IMRT. The results have allowed to start clinical treatments and to establish a quality control set for this technique. The next step is the real time dosimetry with a portal imager.","2079":"Dosimetric properties of a new film, the Extended Dose Range-EDR2, manufactured by Kodak, have been studied. We have established the response of the film versus dose and compared it with that of X-OMAT V films. We found a linear response with dose, for the range from 0.5 to 4 Gy. No dependence of this curve with beam quality and with depth is observed. EDR2 films are useful for dosimetric study of high-energy photon beam, especially when high dose gradient occurs such as for Intensity Modulated Radiotherapy Treatment.","2080":"Verification of absorbed dose in target volume is a key factor for quality assurance in radiotherapy. In vivo measurements allow evaluation of the variations in dose with time and variations between measured doses and calculated doses by TPS. The aim of this work were to evaluate reproducibility of patient positioning and to compare calculated doses by 2 different TPS. Twenty patients were divided in 2 groups according to the thickness of their breast (mean SSD = 92.9 cm). In vivo measurement was performed within the first two sessions. Reproducibility of SSD evaluation was made on 12 beams between 2 fractions. With a tolerance margin of 0.5 cm, positioning errors were present in 33% (4\/12). The 2 TPS were in agreement in 75% (30\/40). In vivo dosimetry can be a very interesting tool to assess patients positioning variations and TPS dose calculation. ","2081":"Radiation retinopathy is a retinal microangiopathy, observed after irradiation of the eye. It can rarely lead to neovascular glaucoma and enucleation due to pain. It is due to a progressive retinal capillary then vascular occlusion. Total irradiation dose, dose fraction, and surface of the irradiated retina seem to be strong predictive factors for radiation retinopathy. Patients who underwent an irradiation near the eye (skull base tumors, nasal and paranasal tumors, or brain tumors) should be followed by periodic ophthalmologic examination to detect and treat when necessary the non perfusion areas.","2082":"Hodgkin disease intracranial lesions are uncommon. We report the case of a 24-year-old man who presented with an intracranial relapse without other evidence of disease 24 months after multiple drug therapy and extended field radiation therapy for stage III Bb type 3 Hodgkin disease. The patient was treated by whole brain irradiation (40 Gy\/20 fractions\/4 weeks). Six months after completion of therapy, the patient had a second relapse, with bilateral inguinal metastatic nodes, which were treated by a second line polychemotherapy. The patient was free of disease 9 months later.","2083":"Radiation recall refers to a tissue reaction produced by a chemotherapeutic agent in a previously irradiated field that would not occur in a nonirradiated field. Docetaxel is a member of the taxane group of antineoplastic agents that cause disruption of cell division by enhancing microtubule assembly and inhibiting tubulin depolymerisation. As well as in breast cancer and lung cancer treatment, its association in a chemoradiation planned treatment becomes frequent and effective. Most of radiation recall dermatitis (RDD) reported in literature concerned paclitaxel or other drugs. We report two particularly striking cases of RDD with docetaxel and radiotherapy. Even if etiology remains undetermined, a number of hypotheses can be formulated. Familiarity with this phenomenon and potential complications of chemotherapy following tumor irradiation may expedite early diagnosis and appropriate lifesaving treatment.","2084":"","2085":"Retrospective analysis of six patients with intracranial germinoma treated in INO and a literature review. Six patients were treated from 1993 to 1998, for histologically verified primary intracranial germinoma. Median age was 18 years (range: 14-26 years). All patients received chemo-radiotherapy (4FP + radiotherapy from 30 to 50 Gy). 4 tumours were in complete remission. Two patients have kept non-evolutive residual cyst. Five patients are alive with non-evolutive disease after 15-40 months of follow-up (average: 27 months). One patient was lost to follow-up, 14 months after treatment, without disease. The treatment of intracranial germinoma is currently first line chemotherapy followed by low-dose and limited irradiation. ","2086":"The \"Standards, Options and Recommendations\" (SOR) project, started in 1993, is a collaboration between the Federation of french cancer centers (FNCLCC), the 20 french cancer centers, and specialists from french public universities, general hospitals and private clinics. The main objective is the development of clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of health care and the outcome of cancer patients. The methodology is based on a literature review and critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary group of experts, with feedback from specialists in cancer care delivery. To develop clinical practice guidelines for non metastatic breast cancer patients according to the definitions of the Standards, Options and Recommendations project. Data were identified by searching Medline, web sites, and using the personal reference lists of members of the expert groups. Once the guidelines were defined, the document was submitted for review to 148 independent reviewers. This article presents the chapter radiotherapy resulting from the 2001 update of the version first published in 1996. The modified 2001 version of the standards, options and recommendations takes into account new information published. The main recommendations are: (1) Breast irradiation after conservative surgery significantly decrease the risk of local recurrence (level of evidence A) and the decrease in the risk of local recidive after chest wall irradiation is greater as the number of risk factors for local recurrence increases (level of evidence A). (2) After conservative surgery, a whole breast irradiation should be performed at a minimum dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions (standard, level of evidence A). (3) A boost in the tumour bed should be performed in women under 50 years, even if the surgical margins are free (standard, level of evidence B). (4) Internal mammary chain irradiation is indicated for internal or central tumours in the absence of axillary lymph node involvement (expert agreement) and in the presence of lymph node involvement (standard, level of evidence B1). (5) Sub- and supra-claviculr lymph node irradiation is indicated in patients with axillary node involvement (standard, level of evidence B1). ","2087":"To identify prognostic factors and treatment toxicity in a series of operable stages IB and II cervical carcinomas. Between May 1972 and January 1994, 414 patients (pts) with cervical carcinoma staged according to the 1995 FIGO staging system underwent radical hysterectomy with (n = 380) or without (n = 34) bilateral pelvic lymph node dissection. Lateral ovarian transposition to preserve ovarian function was performed on 12 pts. The methods of radiation therapy (RT) were not randomised and depended on the usual practices of the surgical teams. Group I: 168 pts received postoperative RT (64 pts received vaginal brachytherapy alone [mean total dose (MD): 50 Gy], 93 pts had external beam pelvis RT (EBPRT) [MD: 45 Gy over 5 weeks] followed by vaginal brachytherapy [MD: 20 Gy], and 11 pts had EBPRT alone [MD: 50 Gy over 6 weeks]. Group II: 246 pts received preoperative utero-vaginal brachytherapy [MD: 65 Gy], and 32 of theses 246 pts also received postoperative EBPRT [MD: 45 Gy over 5 weeks] delivered to the parametric and the pelvic lymph nodes with a midline pelvic shield. The mean follow-up was 106 months. The 10-year disease-free survival (DFS) rate was 80%. From 75 recurrences, 35 were isolated locoregional. Multivariate analysis showed that independent factors decreasing the probability of DFS were: both exo and endocervical tumour site (p = 0.047), lymph-vascular space invasion (p = 0.041), age &lt; or = 51 yr (p = 0.013), 1995 FIGO staging system (stage IB1 vs stage IIA, p = 0.004, stage IB1 vs stage IB2, p = 0.0009, and stage IB1 vs stage IIB with 1\/3 proximal parametrical infiltration, p = 0.00002), and histological pelvic involved lymph nodes (p = 0.00009). Methods of adjuvant RT did not influence the probability of DFS (group I vs group II, p = 0.10). The postoperative complication rate was 10.2% in group I and 8.9% in group II (p = 0.7) but the postoperative urethral complication rate necessitating surgical intervention with reimplantation was lower in group I than in group II (0.6% vs 2.3%, respectively, p = 0.03). The 10-year rate for grade 3 and 4 late radiation complications according to the LENT-SOMA scoring system was 10.4%. EPRT significantly increased the 10-year rate for grade 3 and 4 late radiation complications (yes vs no: 22% vs 7%, respectively, p = 0.0002). In our series, the methods of adjuvant RT (primary surgery vs preoperative uterovaginal brachytherapy) do not seem to influence the prognosis of the stage IB, IIA, and IIB (with 1\/3 proximal parametrical involvement only) cervical carcinomas. The postoperative EPRT applied according to histopathological risk factors after surgical treatment increases the risk of late radiation complications. ","2088":"To identify, through a review of the literature, the laboratory variables that would allow a more accurate stratification of unresected non small-cell lung cancer patients who participate in clinical trials. Systematic review, without meta-analysis, following the recommendations of the International Federation of Clinical Chemistry and Laboratory Medicine, and taking into account the Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials statement. Of 1106 publications retrieved, we were able to include only fourteen studies in our review. Available evidence would support the use of several laboratory variables as prognostic covariables to stratify non resected non small-cell lung cancer patients in clinical trials, but blood haemoglobin would be the only one that could be recommended on a routine basis, and only in patients treated with radiotherapy (three studies out of three). The possible consequences in terms of therapeutic decision of haemoglobin measurements remain however to be clarified. Until better designed studies are published, a number of arguments would support the pre-treatment measurements of the following variables in patients participating in clinical trials: blood haemoglobin, white blood cell count with differential, serum LDH, albumin, calcium, and NSE. Further studies would also be necessary to support the addition to this list, of other tumour markers (including Cyfra 21-1), and\/or measurements during or after treatment. ","2089":"The prognosis of locally advanced cervix cancers is poor with metastatic and local recurrence risks. Recent publications reported that concurrent chemotherapy and pelvic radiation increased local control compared to radiotherapy alone. Chemotherapy could also decrease metastatic recurrences. We report 92 cases of patients with locally advanced cervix cancer treated between 1986 and 1998 at the Institut Curie. Concurrent chemoradiation was exclusive in 51 cases and added to surgery in 41 cases. Chemotherapy with 5FU-Cisplatin-Mitomycin C-Vindesin (protocol A) was performed for 43% of patients and 57% of them received 5FU-Cisplatin alone (protocol B). Median follow-up was 64 months (6-149 months). Five-year disease-free survival rate was 47% and local control rate was 70%. Disease-free survival was correlated with therapeutic response. After exclusive chemoradiation, the good responsive patients had a better DFS (54% vs 26%, p = 0.018). In the surgery group, those patients with sterilized lymph nodes and tumours had also a higher DFS (76% vs 47%, p = 0.036). Toxicity was higher with protocol A. From our study, it appears that local control of advanced cervix cancers is better with combined chemoradiotherapy but disease-free survival stays low according to the metastatic evolution. Metastasis without local recurrence remained frequent in our study. 5FU-CDDP chemotherapy has a lower toxicity and is as effective as 5FU-CDDP-Mitomycin C-Vindesin protocol, in association with radiotherapy. ","2090":"Metabolic radiotherapy is a new therapy for management of bone pain in patients with bone metastatic prostate carcinoma. Strontium-89 and Samarium-153 concentrate in bone metastases and radiate them. A pain decrease is obtained in 60-70% of cases. Side effects are a significant hematological depression without great clinical consequences if good therapeutic indications are respected. Our multidisciplinary experience of these radionuclides in 54 performed treatments shows a rate of good responders of 66% with a rate of excellent results (total decrease of pain) in 47%. The therapeutic effectiveness is correlated with pain intensity measured by Visual Analogic Scale (VAS) and equivalent dose of morphine. Radionuclide therapy should be applied to patients as early as possible after establishment of bone metastases.","2091":"The precise assessment of sexual dysfunction after treatment of prostatic cancer cannot be avoided in 2002. These iatrogenic complications may significantly alter the quality of life of the patients. In addition, sexual toxicity is progressively becoming a cardinal parameter for the treatment choice, both for the patient and the physician. Significant efforts allowed to reduce sexual toxicity after therapy in the recent years. As an example, nerve-sparing surgical techniques have been proposed, whenever reasonable. However, in spite of these surgical advances, data suggest that overall, the new irradiation techniques (conformal radiotherapy and brachytherapy) are responsible for less alteration of sexual life than surgery. Another potential advantage is that sildenafil (Viagra) is able to restore potency in a majority of cases after radiotherapy, while it is usually poorly effective after surgery.","2092":"Patients presenting with non-metastatic cancer of prostate have a high probability of relapse if they are treated by either surgery alone or irradiation alone, when poor prognosis factors are present. Clinical stage (&gt; or = T3a), Gleason score, and PSA level (&gt; 20 ng\/mL) are the more significant factors. It is likely that many patients can draw benefit of combined androgenic suppression and radiotherapy. However, despite results of European and American trials published the last decade, a number of questions remain without a clear response, especially on the modalities of treatment according to the characteristics of the disease.","2093":"Biochemical relapse after radical prostatectomy is not exceptional, ranging from 10 to 40% in the literature. To prevent this biochemical failure, adjuvant radiotherapy was proposed to patients with a high risk of relapse. No phase III trial has actually validated this attitude. Best indications for adjuvant irradiation seem to be patients with an extensive extracapsular extension or multiple positive margins. Historical comparisons seems to confer, in these case, a benefit in biochemical control for adjuvant irradiation versus observation. Others authors prefer immediate post-operative irradiation, a delayed treatment, when biochemical relapse has occurred. This attitude has spared some patients irradiation useless. This salvage irradiation lowered the PSA level in 40 to 70% of the cases, but long-term efficiency is obtained only in the case of a low value of the PSA before irradiation. Delayed radiotherapy is, therefore, justified only if a close follow-up is performed, with repeated dosage of PSA. Whatever the case, it is important to differentiate between local and distant relapse: patients with positive nodes at the time of surgery are most likely at risk of distant relapse. It seems that patients with seminal vesicles involvement are also at high risk for distant relapse, but this must be confirmed.","2094":"Serum PSA is an excellent marker of disease status after external beam radiotherapy or brachytherapy for patients with prostate carcinoma. A low PSA nadir &lt; or = 1 even &lt; or = 0.5 ng\/mL has been shown to be as a surrogate end point for disease control. Three successive increases of this marker after achieving the nadir defines recurrence as recommended by the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology. The biochemical relapse or PSA failure after treatment precedes clinical disease relapse by several months. PSA profile or kinetics may have implications for patterns of failure and prognosis. Prostate post-radiotherapy biopsies should not be part of routine follow-up as its interpretation is frequently problematic. Other exams should not be performed unless clinical symptoms are present. Post-radiotherapy relapse treatment has generally no curative intent.","2095":"In the last decade, brachytherapy emerged as a particularly appealing new way ot treating localized prostate cancer. Recently published 10-12 years biochemical control results appear to be superimposable to the best percentages achieved by surgery or conformal radiotherapy, with a small percentage of complications. This applied to severely patients. Only patients with T1\/T2, PSA &lt; 10 ng\/mL, and Gleason score &lt; 7 should be proposed such a treatment. The potential benefit of exploring patients with a endorectal coil MRI is being evaluated. The number of positive biopsies is also a parameter which should probably be considered in the therapeutic choice. Moreover, a prostate volume &gt; 60 g, hip mobility limitations, a urinary obstructive syndrome and previous transurethral resection lead to difficulties in technical implantation and therefore must be taken into account when discussing brachytherapy. In conclusion, for adequately selected patients, brachytherapy offers a particularly applied alternative to surgery and external radiotherapy, with satisfactory long term biochemical control rates and limited complications.","2096":"External radiotherapy is one of the modalities used to cure localized prostate carcinoma. Most of localized prostate carcinomas, specially those of the intermediate prognostic group, may benefit from escalated dose above 70 Gy at least as regard biochemical and clinical relapse free survival. 3D-CRT allows a reduction of the dose received by organs at risk and an increase of prostate dose over 70 Gy. It is on the way to become a standard. Intensity modulated radiation therapy increases dose homogeneity and reduces rectal dose. These methods necessitate rigorous procedures in reproducibility, delineation of volumes, dosimetry, daily treatment. They need also technological and human means. It is clear that localized prostate cancer is a good example for evaluation of these new radiotherapy modalities.","2097":"Local control is an important goal in the treatment of prostate cancer. Firstly, it avoids the morbidity due to locoregional evolution (urethral obstruction, vascular compression, rectal or vesical involvement). Moreover, local control of the disease may decrease the mortality due to metastases disseminated from local relapse. Local control evaluation remains difficult: neither rectal examination nor imaging or prostate biopsies have an absolute value in diagnostic of local relapse. PSA increase does not permit to differentiate local from distant relapses. Recent developments in radiotherapy techniques allow dose escalation without major toxicity. Retrospective studies and one randomized study have shown that an increase from 70 to 80 Gy or more, improve biological relapse-free survival. In one randomized study comparing 70 to 78 Gy, the biochemical disease-free survival was improved from 69 to 79% at five years. Such an improvement can only be explained by an improvement of local control. The benefit in term of overall survival is not yet demonstrated and needs a longer follow-up and other studies. Another approach to improve local control is the association of a local radiotherapy with hormonal adjuvant therapy. Four randomized studies have been published for locally advanced prostate cancer. These studies have all demonstrated an improvement of local control, and a decrease of metastatic risk. The benefit in term of overall survival, observed in one of this trial, may be explained by the improvement of either local or distant control or both. Such therapeutic progress, associated with the development of prostate cancer screening should lead to a decrease of prostate cancer mortality for the next ten years.","2098":"Answering the question from patients with adenocarcinoma of the prostate is always difficult; choice of radiation therapy (versus prostatectomy), indications of brachytherapy frequency and severity of acute and late effects as rate of survival, local control, are among the most frequent inquiries. A part of the answers are not evident of due lack, consensus and the physicians need to speak honestly and give the most appropriate responses without improving anxiety and fears of the patient.","2099":"The systematic work-up for patient with clinically localised prostate cancer must allow a reconciliation of all the necessary elements to propose one or several therapeutical options. The evaluation must take into account the life's expectancy, and must precise the cancer progression and prognostic factors. The life expectancy depends out age, performance status and comorbidities. Digital rectal exam, PSA and Gleason score analysis are systematic. These tests allow the specialist to decide whether or not to complete the progression work-up by bone scan and pelvic CT. This first work-up should define if a patient will benefit from some curative local treatment. In case of palliative treatment or deferred treatment, the work-up highlights the specialist to decide the medical supervision. Some exams, systematic or not, are very specific from each therapeutic modality considered; they allow to precise individually the efficacy and toxicity prognostic factors for each therapeutic strategy. The final therapeutic decision is based at first on this objective data even if they are probabilistic, and finally on informed patients preferences.","2100":"","2101":"Evaluation of acute urinary toxicity following prostate Iodine-125 brachytherapy and determination of risk factors. Between September 2000 and July 2001, 50 men were entered into the study. A clinical follow-up accompanied by an objective measurement of urinary morbidity, including uroflowmetry and post-void residue, enabled the evaluation of acute toxicity before and then at one, three and six months of the implantation. Predictors were also searched for. 38 (76%) patients developed urinary disorders but those remained minor or moderate. The IPSS, as well as uroflowmetry deteriorated significantly at the first and third month post-implant, before improving during the sixth month. Besides, the variations of the post-void residue were less significant. Concerning the factors of risk, an initial IPSS superior to eight and a prior alpha-blocker treatment were the preoperative identified risk factors. Regarding dosimetric parameters, preoperative U30 and postoperative D90, D95, V100, V150 and V200 were identified. Though remaining minor or moderate, the great frequency of acute urinary toxicity following prostate brachytherapy requires frank and open dialogue with the patient in conjunction with an evaluation of the urinary status before implantation Patients with higher initial IPSS or having required a prior alpha-blocker treatment are more exposed to these disorders and their correlated postoperative dosimetric factors. ","2102":"To identify prognostic factors and treatment toxicity in a series of operable bulky stages I and II cervical carcinomas treated with a therapeutic modality combining primary irradiation and surgery. Between July 1982 and May 1996, 66 patients with bulky squamous-cell cervical carcinomas (stage IB2, IIA, and IIB with 1\/3 proximal parametrial invasion) underwent primary external beam pelvic radiation therapy (37.40 Gy to 40 Gy over 4.5 weeks) and low-dose-rate uterovaginal brachytherapy (20 Gy) followed, 5 to 6 weeks later, by class II modified radical hysterectomy with bilateral pelvic lymphadenectomy. The four last patients received concomitant chemotherapy during the first and the fourth radiation week combining 5-FU and cisplatin. A clinical pelvic lymph node involvement had been observed in 7 patients. The clinical median tumor size was 5 cm in diameter (range: 4.5-8 cm). The median follow-up was 97 months. Pathologic complete tumor response in specimen of hysterectomy were observed in 46 patients. Six patients had pathologic unilateral iliac lymph node involvement. The 5- and 10-year specific survival rates were 79 and 74%, respectively. The 5- and 10-year disease-free survival rates were 76% and 71%, respectively. The 10-year local control rate was 85%. The 10-year probability for pelvic recurrence was significantly influenced by the pathologic tumor response: 26% in the residual group vs 5% in the complete tumor response group, P = 0.024). After multivariate analysis, the independent factors decreasing the probability of disease-free survival were: pathologic pelvic lymph node involvement (P = 0.029), and parametrial invasion (P = 0.031). Five late severe complications requiring surgical intervention were observed: 2 bowel obstructions, 1 ureteral stenosis, 1 vesicovaginal fistula, and 1 radiation induced unilateral femoral necrosis. A good local control is obtained after combined primary radiation therapy and surgery for bulky stages I and II cervical carcinomas. In our more recent practice, the treatment combines primary concomitant chemoradiation followed by surgery including pelvic and para-aortic lymphadenectomy. ","2103":"The conventional radiotherapy and the associated treatments improved the prognostic of nasopharyngeal cancer. A better selection of the patients who must have a more aggressive treatment also probably contributed to this improvement. Even if a relation could be found between the locoregional relapse rate and the distant relapse rate, these two events remain often independent. It results from it that the improvement of local control rate necessarily does not result in a better control of the disease. The patients with a locally advanced tumor, with or not an invasion of the base of the skull and\/or neurological symptoms, must have an aggressive locally treatment. This probably includes the increase in dose delivered to the tumor via a more conformational radiotherapy, a brachytherapy, radiotherapy in stereotaxic conditions or other techniques. Dose within the tumor must be at least 70 Gy and the prophylactic nodal dose, at least 50 Gy. CT scan and MRI are essential for delineating the volumes of interest. The protocols of hyperfractionated radiotherapy did not give convincing results. Association with chemotherapy allowed, on the other hand, an improvement of the prognostic locally advanced cancers. Neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy was largely used to attempt to limit the risks of systemic dissemination, but an improvement of results was not clearly demonstrated. An improvement of the rates of survival and control of the disease, on the other hand, was observed in a certain number of studies with the chemoradiotherapy. In the event of locoregional relapse, an aggressive attitude can allow the control of the disease in the absence of systemic dissemination. Salvage treatments are, however, disappointing for when distant relapse occurs which suggests a difference in chemosensitivity between primary tumor and metastasis.","2104":"The \"Standards, Options and Recommendations\" (SOR) collaborative project was initiated in 1993 by the Federation of the French Cancer Centres (FNCLCC), with the 20 French Regional Cancer Centres, several French public university and general hospitals, as well as private clinics and medical speciality societies.

This rarity explains of one part certain difficulties of the histological diagnosis and on the other hand the absence of a therapeutic strategy clearly established. We report 4 cases of primary non-hodgkin lymphoma of the uterus. Two patients had a cervical location, the two other had corpus location. The average age of our patients is of 59 years (extremes: 54-68). Histological diagnosis was confirmed by biopsy for the cervical location. For the corpus location, it is study of the uterus after hysterectomy which retained the diagnosis of lymphoma. The type of the lymphoma was low grade in two cases and high grade in the two other cases. The disease was limited to the pelvis for all our patients (stage IE according to Ann-Arbor's classification). The treatment consisted of an association of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in both cases of lymphoma of the cervix and in a radical hysterectomy followed by chemotherapy for the two cases of lymphoma of the corpus. Our patients are regularly followed, with an average follow-up of 56 months. Two patients are in disease free, the third patient presented a dissemination of the disease and the fourth patient presented a squamous cell carcinoma of the lung.","2111":"A CT acquisition during a free breathing examination generates images of poor quality. It creates an uncertainty on the reconstructed gross tumour volume and dose distribution. The aim of this study is to test the feasibility of a breath hold method applied in all preparation and treatment days. Five patients received a thoracic radiotherapy with the benefit of this procedure. The breathing of the patient was measured with a spirometer. The patient was coached to reproduce a constant level of breath-hold in a deep inspiration. Video glasses helped the patients to fix the breath-hold at the reference level. The patients followed the coaching during preparation and treatment, without any difficulty. The better quality of the CT reconstructed images resulted in an easier contouring. No movements of the gross tumour volume lead to a better coverage. The deep breath hold decreased the volume of irradiated lung. This method improves the reproducibility of the thoracic irradiation. The decrease of irradiated lung volume offers prospects in dose escalation and intensity modulation radiotherapy.","2112":"Retrospective study of 23 patients treated with conformal radiotherapy for a locally advanced bile duct carcinoma. Eight cases were irradiated after a radical resection (R0), because they were N+; seven after microscopically incomplete resection (R1); seven were not resected (R2). A dose of 45 of 50 Gy was delivered, followed by a boost up to 60 Gy in R1 and R2 groups. Concomitant chemotherapy was given in 15 cases. Late toxicity included a stenosis of the duodenum, and one of the biliary anastomosis. Two patients died from cholangitis, the mechanism of which remains unclear. Five patients are in complete remission, six had a local relapse, four developed a peritoneal carcinosis, and six distant metastases. Actuarial survival rate is 75%, 28% and 7% at 1, 3 and 5 years, respectively (median: 16.5 months). Seven patients are still alive with a 4 to 70 months follow-up. Survival is similar in the 3 small subgroups. The poor local control among R0N+ cases might be related to the absence of a boost to the \"tumor bed\". In R1 patients, relapses were mainly distant metastases, whereas local and peritoneal recurrences predominated in R2. Conformal radiochemotherapy delivering 60 Gy represents a valuable palliative approach in locally advanced biliary carcinoma. ","2113":"Cyfra 21-1, measuring serum fragments of cytokeratin 19, has been found to be related to tumour stage and tumour size in patients with cervical cancer. It could be a promising marker in squamous lung cancer. We evaluated this new marker with carcinoembryonic antigen, (CEA) and squamous cell carcinoma antigen (SCC-Ag) in the monitoring of 27 patients with head and neck cancer. The retrospective study group consisted of 27 patients, 17 not suited for surgery and 10 after laser resection. Patients were clinically staged according to the TNM-classification. The mean age of the patients was 53 years (range 37-70 years). Serum levels of each marker were studied in relation to tumour stage and clinical status of the patients during radiotherapy and 6 weeks after the end of the treatment. The clinical performance of the various assays to separate those patients with complete remission from those patients with the presence of tumour was assessed. Pre-treatment serum Cyfra 21-1, CEA, and SCC-Ag levels were not related to stage of disease and were not found to be predictive of tumour response. The clinical performance of post-treatment serum SCC-Ag levels in predicting the presence of tumour was not better than the Cyfra 21-1 assays. We could not conclude from this study that Cyfra 21-1 marker is an additional parameter in identifying patients at risk of residual tumour after treatment, recurrent or progressive disease. An elevation of cyfra 21-1 marker was not detectable in 70% of the cases with macroscopic tumour. Therefore, Cyfra 21-1 is not a reliable parameter for the monitoring of patients with head and neck cancer during radiotherapy. ","2114":"Evaluate the results of the treatment of small uterine cervix cancer with the association of surgery and postoperative vaginal brachytherapy, without unfavourable prognostic factors. After radical hysterectomy with lymphadenectomy, 29 women (mean age: 44 years) with carcinoma &lt; 25 mm (26 stage IB1, 3 IIA, mean size: 15 mm) were treated by post-operative prophylactic vaginal brachytherapy using low dose rate. Ovarian transposition was performed at the surgical time in 14 young women (mean age 35 years). The actuarial specific survival rates at 5 and 10 years were 100% and 90% respectively, with a mean follow-up 75 months. Only one local recurrence was observed. The rate of grade 1 post-operative complication was 7%. The conservation rate of the ovarian function was 85% for young women. Treatment of small volume uterine cervix cancer using first surgery and post-operative vaginal brachytherapy is a reliable therapeutic option. The results in terms of specific survival and complications are the same with those after standard association of preoperative uterovaginal brachytherapy and surgery. ","2115":"Osteoradionecrosis is a severe radiotherapy (RT) injury by healing failure, late effect and spontaneously irreversible by tissue death. Histologically, it consists in a pagetoid mosaic that combines a defective osteogenesis with an osteoclastic osteolysis and more marginally an osteolytic osteolysis, turned to account to fibroblastic and collagenic fibrosis. Several pathogenic hypotheses favor sometimes a vascular hypoxic hypotheses, sometimes a fibro-atrophic hypothesis. Various events start up or favour ORN as traumatisms (dental extraction, surgery,...) or bacterian infection on fistula. In clinic, adult mature bone concerned is the mandible after head and neck RT by septic ORN, and the hip after pelvic RT by aseptic ORN. For each, epidemiology, clinic and therapeutic aspects are developed. Usual therapeutic attitudes consisted in restriction of defavorable associated events (dental extraction, infection, RT dose, chemotherapy,...) and devitalized tissue removal. Physiopathological therapeutic innovatives aspects are proposed to struggle against radiation-induced fibrosis associated and to limit bone destruction.","2116":"The \"Standards, Options and Recommendations\" (SOR) collaborative project was initiated in 1993 by the Federation of the French Cancer Centres (FNCLCC), with the 20 French Regional Cancer Centres, several French public university and general hospitals, as well as private clinics and medical specialty societies.

The portion of the rectum receiving 100 and 120% of the prescribed dose must be limited to 10 and 5 mm length, respectively. ","2117":"In 1996 and 2000, a survey of radiation practice in Belgium was performed by sending a questionnaire to the different centers asking their opinion and number of patients treated. There was a great similarity between the two surveys both for indications and total number of patients irradiated. For the most common indications (prevention of cheloids, heterotopic bone formation, hyperthyroidy ophthalmopathy), there was a trend to use similar radiation technique following recent publications. In contrast, if the number of cases of macular degeneration is declining, the prevention of vessels restenosis is becoming more and more an indication.","2118":"The physical and dosimetrical characteristics of a device, designed to visualize the isocenter position on electronic portal images, were examined. The device, to be mounted on the gantry head of the accelerator, containing five spheric lead markers, was designed in order to visualize the isocenter position on portal images. A quality control device was designed to check the reliability of this technique. The disturbance of the dose distribution by the markers was studied with gel dosimetry. The use of markers resulted in a precise and accurate method to visualize the isocenter on portal images. A maximum underdosage of 11%, due to attenuation by the markers, was observed. The use of markers to visualize the isocenter position on portal images, is a fast and reliable method when analyzing patient setup errors with online electronic portal imaging.","2119":"Modulated intensity dose distributions are obtained by inverse planning. It requires an inversion algorithm and an objective function that can be physical or biological. The biological objective functions aim at quantifying the probability of the favourable end of the treatment. The inversion algorithm used is analytical and is based on the mathematical analysis of the singular values decomposition. It proposes as many solutions as there are elementary beams. From the Tumour Control Probability, Normal Tissue Complication Probabilities and complication free tumour control, three biological assessment functions of the proposed solutions are compared with the least square difference between the prescribed and obtained dose distributions. We used a simplified irradiation configuration: Brahme's dose prescription (2D modelling of a prostate) and 9 beams (1D). The choice by mean of biological criterion of the optimal solution makes it possible to increase the average dose in the tumour, so as its homogeneity compared to physical optimisation. Conversely, the organs at risk are then less protected. The laying down of relevant constraints makes it possible to obtain satisfactory dose distributions. Concerning the validity of the models and data used, some limitations appear. At present time, it seems to exclude the use in clinical routine of an only biological optimisation. The future availability of new biological data will allow the development and in particular the clinical use of biological optimisation.","2120":"Uterine sarcoma is a rare disease and survival is poor. From 1975 to 1995, 73 uterine sarcomas were treated at the Curie Institute, and we analysed prognostics factors of survival. Seventy-one patients underwent primary surgery, in most cases a radical non conservative surgery and a lymphadenectomy. Every patient had an irradiation (external beam irradiation and\/or brachytherapy), and 24 patients received adjuvant chemotherapy. We observed that youngest patients had more leiomyosarcomas and low histologic grade tumours. Median survival was 42 months, and 5-years survival and local control were 36 and 68% respectively. Pelvic recurrences were most often before 2 years. This series demonstrates the impact of adjuvant irradiation on local control. This impact was stronger if the tumour had a high histologic grade (p &lt; 0.01). However, irradiation, as well as chemotherapy, had no impact on the survival. The study confirmed that irradiation enable a better local control. However modalities of radiation therapy (brachytherapy and\/or external beam radiotherapy, dose, volume), are still controversed. ","2121":"Iodine 125 curietherapy is one of the conservative treatments of uveal melanoma. The technique used to achieve these results was simplified through the physical characteristics of the radioelement and the optimized-dosimetry program employed. 78 patients with choroidal melanoma were treated with iodine 125. About 100 Gy were delivered to the superior pole of the tumour. The minimal length of follow-up was 17 months and the average, 67 months. There was 88% local control, leading to lowered visual acuity in 76% of the cases. Radiation retinopathy, directly related to proximity to the macula, is the principle etiology. Seven patients died of hepatic metastasis, five patients were enucleated. Four patients were further treated with protontherapy to make up for noncontrol locally. One dose of 100 Gy to the superior pole of the tumor seemed to lead to good local control, with the exception of complications related to proximity to the macula and the optic nerve. In this attempt to optimize irradiation, the time lapse between any benefit in local control derived from irradiation and posttherapeutic complications observed remains insufficient to evaluate any relationship. ","2122":"Conformal irradiation of non-small cell lung carcinoma (NSCLC) is largely based on a precise definition of the nodal clinical target volume (CTVn). The reduction of the number of nodal stations to be irradiated would render tumor dose escalation more achievable. The aim of this work was to design an mathematical tool based on documented data, that would predict the risk of metastatic involvement for each nodal station. From the large surgical series published in the literature we looked at the main pre-treatment parameters that modify the risk of nodal invasion. The probability of involvement for the 17 nodal stations described by the American Thoracic Society (ATS) was computed from all these publications and then weighted according to the French epidemiological data. Starting from the primitive location of the tumour as the main characteristic, we built a probabilistic tree for each nodal station representing the risk distribution as a function of each tumor feature. From the statistical point of view, we used the inversion of probability trees method described by Weinstein and Feinberg. Taking into account all the different parameters of the pre-treatment staging relative to each level of the ATS map brings up to 20,000 different combinations. The first chosen parameters in the tree were, depending on the tumour location, the histological classification, the metastatic stage, the nodal stage weighted in function of the sensitivity and specificity of the diagnostic examination used (PET scan, CAT scan) and the tumoral stage. A software is proposed to compute a predicted probability of involvement of each nodal station for any given clinical presentation. To better define the CTVn in NSCLC 3DRT, we propose a software that evaluates the mediastinal nodal involvement risk from easily accessible individual pre-treatment parameters. ","2123":"Dedicated studies to esophageal carcinomas are few. Surgical excision remains the treatment of choice for localised tumours. External beam radiation therapy could be used alone to obtain a quick palliation and to allow the recovery of normal eating. Currently, combined modality treatment demonstrated better results when compared to radiation alone. Efficiency of combined modality treatment of adenocarcinoma seems equivalent to epidermoid. Numerous phase II studies demonstrated the feasibility of combined radio-chemotherapy in a preoperative setting. However, phases III trials are criticised and actually no definitive conclusion can be drawn. Inclusion of patients with such a tumour should be encouraged.","2124":"Adenocarcinoma of the esogastric junction is increasing more rapidly than any other cancer in western country. Patients with carcinoma of the cardia often present at an advanced stage of disease. Accurate preoperative staging of cancer of the cardia need computed tomography, endoscopic ultrasound: laparoscopy is useful for advanced cancer to detect liver and peritoneal metastatis, preventing an unnecessary laparotomy in up to 20% of patients. The Siewert's classification of the cancer of the esogastric junction is accepted internationally: type I: tumor center within the late 5 cm of the distal esophagus, treated with subtotal esophagectomy; type II: located at the esogastric junction, treated with distal esophagectomy and, either proximal or total gastrectomy; and type III: subcardial cancer, treated by extended total gastrectomy. The dominating independent prognostic factors are a complete resection (R0) and the lymph node status (pN0) Expected 5 year survival rate is 30% in patients undergoing surgery with curative intent (R0) and less than 1% in patients undergoing palliative surgery.","2125":"The esophagus is divided into four regions: cervical esophagus, intrathoracic esophagus with upper, mid and lower thoracic portion. Cancer may occur on each of these regions. Computed tomography of the thorax and superior abdomen and endoscopic ultrasound are necessary for reliable staging. CT simulation allows accurate definition of tumor volume. GTV includes tumor volume and regional lymph nodes. CTV encompasses GTV plus safety margin and lymph nodes areas considered to harbor potential microscopic disease. The extent of prophylactic lymph node irradiation depends on the anatomic location of the primary tumor.","2126":"Adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus and the gastric cardia have many similar characteristics and common risk factors. Gastric cardia tumors are more closely related to esophageal adenocarcinomas than to distal gastric carcinomas. Adenocarcinomas of the distal esophagus and gastric cardia should be regarded as one clinical entity. However the two types of tumor differed in prevalence of molecular characteristics that are interesting to analyze, to identify the risk factors specially associated with each entities.","2127":"","2128":"Increase local control rate is the main objective of 3D conformal radiotherapy (3DCRT) through sparing surrounding tissues and more precise target volume irradiation. Limits are however present for each step of the procedure (immobilisation device, anatomical data acquisition, dose calculation and optimisation, treatment verification and execution). Dose distribution is clearly better with 3DCRT and allows dose escalation. However, clinical data comparing irradiation techniques are rare and do not allow to consider yet 3DCRT as a standard treatment. Medical and medico-economical studies are warranted both for 3DCRT and IMRT in order to prove their utility and justify their cost.","2129":"Conformal radiotherapy results from several technical and data processing advances. The treatment planning and the daily treatments have benefited from a significant improvement of the quality control. However, all the steps of the process contain various limitations of varying effects. It appear important to identify, describe and exploit those limits to better drive the procedures and optimise the quality. Identifying the limits of the conformal radiotherapy should be an important help to implement intensity modulation radiotherapy.","2130":"Conformational radiotherapy is more and more used. It seems that this kind of treatment requests more manpower and material than 2D techniques. The purpose was to estimate its cost. We first tried to estimate the development of 3D radiotherapy. Then we calculated its relative cost compared to classical radiation therapy. To estimate relative costs, we first used the official catalogue. Then we reported results of a study performed in 1998 in two different radiotherapy departments. We conclude that 3D treatment are more expensive. The incremental cost is mainly related to that of dosimetry.","2131":"National French investigation of the using of conformal radiotherapy in routine work, has been made in 2001, in 180 radiotherapeutic centers. Eighty responses have been obtained and analyzed. Conformal radiotherapy is used in 88% and virtual simulation in 60% of these centers. There is a heterogeneity in the equipment of these institutions, most of them have one or two machines. The accelerator equipment differs, and the disponibility of multileaf collimators and electronic portal imaging is limited. Actually only eleven centers have IMRT, eight have projects to install. Only six centers have CT-scans, used mainly for simulation. In 75% of centers, conformal radiotherapy have been used in the treatment of CNS-tumors, head and neck cancers, prostate, and non-small cell lung carcinoma. If there are more equipment and human facilities to use conformal radiotherapy, this treatment can be proposed to patients with breast cancer, rectal and gynecological tumors. According 90% of responses, all prostatic cancers need conformal radiotherapy. The analysis of routine use of conformal radiotherapy in France shows an important heterogeneity but it seems that there is an agreement with objectives of this treatment.","2132":"The twentieth century has witnessed the discovery of the various genetic alterations that drive a normal cell toward neoplasia. One the challenge of the near future concerns the diagnostic of these alterations and their correlation with clinical parameters such as response to therapy or survival. It will be important to define, for each patient, a specific profile of the various alterations in order to improve and personalize the therapy. It is also essential to understand the various mechanisms of these alterations in order to develop new diagnostic procedures. Furthermore, the relation between genotype and phenotype is not straightforward and can be influence by various parameters such as the localization of the mutation, alterations of other genes or the expression of modifiers genes.","2133":"Nasopharyngeal carcinoma (NPC) is a highly radiosensitive and chemosensitive. In the patient with locally advanced tumours, the results of conventional radiotherapy are unsatisfactory with significant rates of both local recurrences and distant metastases. The aim of this review is to report the innovative strategies for treatment of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Altered fractionation techniques can improve local control. The impact of the innovative techniques, including conformal radiation, stereotactic radiation and IMRT, on survival, must be evaluated in randomised trials. The encouraging early results obtained with concurrent (more than sequential) chemotherapy and radiotherapy must be confirmed in prospective randomized trial in endemic areas.","2134":"Nasopharynx carcinomas (NPC) are a very special head and neck cancer, in term of epidemiology, clinic and pathology. Endemic disease in South East Asia, undifferentiated nasopharynx carcinoma are very frequent CT scan and NMR allow a better knowledge of the modalities of the clinical presentation. Prognostic factors include local and regional extension. NPC is a wellknown radiosensitive disease with a dose-response curve well established. Modern imaging modalities and modification of the ballistic explain the amelioration of the local control and the diminution of therapeutic sequellae. Brachytherapy is an interesting modalities for the boost and the treatment of recurrent disease. The exact place of 3 D CRT and IMRT is not yet known as modifications of fractionation. Local control for T1T2 tumor is excellent but is related to clinical extension (cranial and neurologic involvement) and nodal extension (supra clavicular N3) and show the interest of combined chemo-radiotherapy protocols.","2135":"The phenotype of malignant epithelial cells in nasopharyngeal carcinomas (NPC) results from latent infection by the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) combined to cell gene alterations, especially those affecting the p16\/Ink 4 gene. At the site of the primary tumor, NPC are strongly infiltrated by non-malignant EBV-negative T-lymphocytes. There are experimental clues suggesting that these lymphocytes are involved in tumor development, for example by providing anti-apoptotic signals to malignant epithelial cells. The amazing geographic distribution of NPC is accounted for by the conjunction of several risk factors in endemic regions. These risk factors are related to the diffusion of one or several susceptibility genes, the probable existence of viral strains with high oncogenic potential and non-viral environmental factors, especially dietary factors. The perspectives of immunotherapy in NPC are still unclear since viral proteins detected in tumors are poorly immunogenic (EBNA1, LMP1). Targeted molecules designed to interfere with viral and cellular oncoprotein signals will probably have interesting applications for the treatment of NPC.","2136":"The DICOM standard protocol of medical image exchange and its extensions to radiotherapy data has been implemented in order to enable electronic communication between all modalities within our radiology and radiotherapy departments. The network architecture used for radiotherapy includes as basic elements one CT simulator, several treatment planning systems, one linear accelerator fitted with multileaf collimator, one electronic portal imaging system and several laser imagers. As customary in radiotherapy departments, our equipments are heterogeneous with respect to manufacturers and computer operating systems. Choosing to resort to the DICOM-RT protocol spared us the acquisition of a proprietary information system because its elementary inter-connectivity characteristics can effectively be used for dataflow management. It has the advantage to minimally change the user's way of working since the electronic data transfer is taking place sequentially from one workstation to the other in a manner analogous to what is done with the paper document. Quality assurance management of treatments is simplified by the electronic nature of the transfers from the CT-simulation down to the accelerator since modalities interfaces, instead of users, are performing consistency checks. This process results in substantial time saving, but the DICOM computer interface is requiring a better skill that the one needed for operating standard office software. The DICOM-RT protocol is presently missing some functionality necessary for its integration into our hospital information system. Our experience is however showing that it represents a viable and promising solution for a small radiotherapy department.","2137":"The PACS (Picture Archiving and Communication System) is a central radiologic image archiving system coupled with an information system which allows rapid access to these images. It permits rapid access of the entire file of radiologic images of a patient for radiologists and clinicians. After installation of an MRI and CT scan unit at the IGR, a PACS system was installed in July, 2000. The preparation phase and characteristics of the PACS system at the IGR are described here. The data in the literature and the short experience of the PACS system at the IGR show benefits of this system at several levels: improved efficiency (for technicians, radiologists, and secretaries), improved image quality and interpretation, improved clinical management of patients resulting from more timely image interpretation and execution of clinical decisions, increased ease of image transfer for tele-imagery, and improved teaching and publication possibilities. The PACS significantly modifies work habits since the interpretation and consultation of images is done exclusively at the console and progressively obviates the need for actual films.","2138":"","2139":"The quality of treatment that one can realize today in conformal radiotherapy, can be reached only if one has access to 3D imaging allowing a precise determination of the volume of the organs at risk and of the GTV. For this reason, one has access to anatomical imaging, CT or MRI, and functional and metabolic imaging, PET or SPECT imaging. CT gives the electronic density of the tissues, which is essential to ensure a very precise calculation of dose distribution. Its insufficiency in the visualization of the tumor and some anatomical structures makes necessary the registration of these images with MRI of which distortions are sufficiently weak to be usable in radiotherapy. The registration will be usable only if images of each modality are realized with the patient in treatment position, except for brain, where only CT, on which is based the registration, must be done in treatment position. At least, if one wants to visualize the active parts of a tumor or to make the difference between fibrosis and tumor left or recurrence after radiotherapy or chemotherapy, it is necessary to use PET or SPECT. To define correctly the CTV using these images, one must realize the anatomical localization of the metabolic abnormalities, which they highlight with a registration based on CT or MRI. The difficulties to obtain the registration of these images led the manufacturer to propose mixed machines allowing to realize, at the same time, a CT imaging and a PET or a SPECT imaging with the patient in treatment position.","2140":"Ovarian carcinoma is the worst gynecologic cancer due to an advanced stage at diagnosis in two thirds of the cases. Advanced stages are usually characterized by a large tumor burden on the ovaries as well as metastatic disease in the peritoneal cavity. Early stages are more common in young women and the surgical treatment should comprise the tumor excision and a comprehensive abdominal staging to be sure that there is no extension beyond the ovaries--unilateral oophorectomy can preserve the fertility before childbearing. No treatment is needed after surgery in stage I without poor prognostic factors. Adjuvant chemotherapy should be applied postoperatively in the other cases. The best likelihood of prolonged survival is observed after optimal debulking surgery and chemotherapy in advanced stages. If possible surgery should be performed at first but in most advanced stage with large tumor volume in the upper abdomen according to clinical and CT-scan examination, the concept of chemosurgical debulking should be considered. Interval surgery underwent after three or four courses of front line chemotherapy but this strategy should be further evaluated by clinical trials. Currently paraplatin associated with paclitaxel is the most commonly used regimen due to its effectiveness and lower toxicity. In a near future progress can be expected with new protocols. Thank to aggressive surgery and chemotherapy many patients should be able to reach a complete remission of their disease but most of them will still die of recurrent disease. At this point, two questions should be answered: 1) how to manage the residual abdominal disease in order to prevent the recurrence. No consolidation treatment demonstrated any superiority but the French experience and trial with high dose chemotherapy supported by autologous stem cells transplantation showed recently positive results? 2) How to manage the recurrent disease with sometime indication for secondary surgical debulking and always chemotherapy? This is the field for testing new drugs or new strategies. A large number of patients should enter clinical trials in order to answer these questions and due to the very poor prognosis of this disease large attention should be given to the quality of life of theses patients.","2141":"Main strategies used as first line treatment of aggressive lymphoma are the subject of this review. The evolution of histopathlogical classifications is reviewed and the concept of aggressive lymphoma is given. General principles of chemotherapy treatment and main prognostic factors that direct therapeutic decisions are described. The treatment modalities of localized and advanced disease are detailed, as well as the role of high-dose therapy with hematopoietic support. Finally, the major impact of immunotherapy based on the monoclonal anti-CD20 antibody is envisaged.","2142":"","2143":"Fatigue is a common complaint for the cancer patient during and after radiotherapy, according to the published studies. Fatigue is a subjective symptom mostly underestimated by oncologists and other care givers. Etiology is complex, poorly understood in spite of obvious causes like insomnia, nausea, pain, depression, psychological distress, anemia, hypothyroidism, menopause disturbances, treatment adverse effects. Fatigue presents multifactorial and multidimensional aspects. To evaluate it, many tools can be used as single-item, unidimensional and multidimensional instruments. Practically, the open discussion with the patient throughout radiotherapy is essential to define it. Taking charge fatigue requires its acknowledgment by radiotherapist, treatment of associated symptoms with a multidisciplinary approach.","2144":null,"2145":"Acute and long term effects are frequent after radiotherapy. They may alter the general status and quality of life of the patients. Chronic radiodermatitis may result in ulceration and in transformation into a squamous cell carcinoma. There is a correlation of the frequency of acute dermatitis with the total dose. Chronic radiodermatitis may develop after repeated small doses of ionizing radiation for cardiac catheterization and coronary angioplasties. The other prognostic factors for the level of acute and late skin reactions are volume of tissue treated, total daily dose, fractionactions schemes ... but there are some variation in the degree of reaction in patients treated with identical radiotherapy schedules. There is a patient-to-patient variability. Several diseases as systemic sclerosis, some genetic diseases, perhaps some drugs may increase the cutaneous reactions. So both acute and chronic irradiation injury is a complex process with many regulations. Chronic fibrosis may be caused by mechanism of cell activation (and particularly fibroblasts). Cytokines e.g. transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) might be involved in the induction of fibrosis. Treatment use emollients. Superoxide dismutase was used as an ointment for radiofibrosis therapy and obtains a reduction of the fibrosis. In late phases plastic surgery or sometimes cryosurgery can be used.","2146":"Adenocarcinomas of esophagus and cardia represent in France approximately 20 to 40% of the esophagus cancers. They have a high risk to develop lymph nodes metastases and liver metastases. Currently, only 50 to 70% of patients may benefit from surgical curative resection at diagnosis, but more than 50% of them will recur. The standard of treatment of these metastatic adenocarcinomas is chemotherapy. Three large randomized comparative studies, between chemotherapy and supportive care, showed that chemotherapy significantly extends the median of survival (from 3-4 months to 10-12 months) and improves the quality of life. Currently, the combination of epirubicin-cisplatin-continuous 5FU (ECF) is the most effective regimen but it is difficult to administer and tolerate because of the long continuous 5FU infusion. In France, the most commonly used combination regimen still associates 5FU and cisplatin. New drugs (such as docetaxel, CPT11, oxaliplatin) used alone or in combination, especially with 5U, are very promising. Radio-chemotherapy is the preferred treatment for locoregional recurrences, because it improves dyphagia and enables to obtain complete tumor responses. Current results from concomitant radio-chemotherapy studies for esophagus cancer, based on 5FU alone, 5FU-cisplatin or 5FU-mitomycin, given as preoperative treatment or as exclusive treatment, support to use radio-chemotherapy for the treatment of loco-regional recurrences after surgical resection. Nevertheless, the optimal radio-chemotherapy schedule still remain to be defined (dose, duration, splitting of radiotherapy, choice of anticancer drugs).","2147":"Pediatric tumors have enjoyed considerable improvements for the past 30 years. This is mainly due to the extensive use of combined therapeutical modalities in which chemotherapy plays a prominent role. In many children, local treatment including radiotherapy, can nowadays be adapted in terms of target volume and dose to the \"response\" to an initial course of chemotherapy almost on a case by case basis. This makes precise recommendation on local therapy highly difficult in this age group. We will concentrate in this paper on brain tumors in which chemotherapy is of limited value and radiotherapy still plays a key-role.","2148":"Bone is one of the three most favored sites of solid tumor metastasis. Skeletal metastasis may be identified by four clinical imaging methods: plain film radiography, computed tomography scanning, radioisotope scanning, and magnetic resonance imaging. The dose per fraction, total dose, and anatomic distribution of the radiation (dosimetry) are important factors in determining the efficacy and normal tissue tolerance to radiotherapy. Controversies about fractionation of palliative radiotherapy for bone metastasis are steel ongoing. The most commonly used schedules are a single treatment of 8 Gy, 30 Gy in 10 fractions and 20 Gy in 5 fractions. Treatment volumes and safety margins depend on the location and the extent of the bone metastasis, and are also determined by the symptoms felt by the patient.","2149":"Soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities are currently treated with more conservative and functional approaches, combining surgery, radiotherapy and chemotherapy. The role of external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy has been defined through randomised studies performed in the 80's and 90's. However, the ubiquity of tumour location for these tumours makes difficult a systematic definition of local treatments. Tumour volume definition is based on pre and post surgical imaging (MRI) and on described pathological report. The clinical target volume will take into account quality of the resection and anatomical barriers and will be based on an anatomy and not only on safety margins around the tumour bed. General rules for this irradiation (doses, volumes) and principal results will be presented.","2150":"Delineation of GTV and CTV for radiotherapy of skin cancer depends on the natural history of each cancer type and on the clinical presentation of the disease. It is fundamental for the choice of the most adapted radiation technique.","2151":"18 FDG positon emission tomography provides metabolic images and allows better local and metastatic staging than radiologic methods. A best cartography of node involvement and a best delineation of the tumor zone should allow an optimal radiotherapy. Lung cancer is a good example of the interest of this new method.","2152":"The aim of this review is to discuss the imaging available for diagnostic, therapy and follow-up for lung cancer management.","2153":"Radiotherapy plays a major role as a curative treatment of various stages non-small cell lung cancers (NSCLC): as an exclusive treatment in curative attempt for patients with unresectable stages I and II; as a preoperative treatment, which is often associated with chemotherapy, for patients with surgically stage IIIA NSCLC in clinical trials; in association with chemotherapy for unresectable stages IIIA and IIIB patients. Currently, three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy allows for some dose escalation, increasing radiation quality. However, the high inherent conformality of this radiotherapy technique requires a rigorous approach and an optimal quality of the preparation throughout the treatment procedure and specifically of the accurate definition of the safety margins (GTV, CTV...). Different questions remain specific to lung cancers: 1) Despite the absence of randomized trials, the irradiated lymph nodes volume should be only, for the majority of the authors, the visible macroscopically involved lymph nodal regions. However, local control remains low and solid arguments suggest the poor local control is due to an insufficient delivered dose. Therefore the goal of radiotherapy, in this particular location, is to improve local control by increasing the dose until the maximum normal tissue tolerance is achieved, which essentially depends on the dose to the organs at risk (OAR) and specifically for the lung, the esophagus and the spinal cord. For this reason, the irradiated volume should be as tiny as possible, leading to not including the macroscopically uninvolved lymph nodes regions in prophylactic view in the target volume; 2) The lung is one of the rare organs with extensive motion within the body, making lung tumors difficult to treat. This particular point is not specifically considered in the GTV and CTV definitions but it is important enough to be noted; 3) When radiation therapy starts after a good response to chemotherapy, the residual tumoral volume should be defined as the target volume in place of the initial tumor volume. These different elements are discussed in this paper.","2154":"The purpose of this article is to specify the target volumes, using ICRU criteria in the treatment of Hodgkin's disease. Because of the complexity of irradiation fields, the literature was carefully reviewed. However, with the variations of the recommendations and in the absence of large-scale studies, usual criteria can still be used. A consensus about the precise specification of the target volumes on CAT scan is still urgently awaited.","2155":"Surgery is the major treatment of the tumours of the corpus uteri. The imaging workup is essentially used to detect locally advanced lesions which are not suitable for surgery, because the preoperative knowledge of prognostic factors seldom influences treatment strategy in the early stages. The 3D planning of external irradiation for corpus uteri tumours is not very widespread, despite its real impact in preoperative irradiation strategy or irradiation alone. In postoperative strategy its importance is less evident; however, CT planning leads to a better knowledge of the dose distribution to the critical organs, which will probably contribute to a better control of late complications.","2156":"Treatment of carcinoma of the uterine cervix needs a multidisciplinary approach. External irradiation and brachytherapy are highly curative because of the tumor radiosensitivity. The main prognostic factors are tumoral volume and nodal involvement. Tumoral extent is evaluated by diagnostic MR imaging, and gynecological exam. Nodal involvement can be assessed, accurately by coelioscopic pelvic node sampling and by imaging modalities such as CT scan. The knowledge of these two factors helps to choose the treatment strategy. The use of imaging (MRI and CT) added to clinical findings allows to design external irradiation fields. 3D treatment planning in external irradiation and brachytherapy is based upon the use of imaging (CT and MRI). It leads to a better knowledge of dose distribution to the target and critical organs and allows more individualized and conformal treatment.","2157":"This article reviews all clinical and pathological data available in the literature supporting the concept of selectivity in the neck nodes to be included in the Clinical Target Volume for head and neck squamous cell carcinoma. Using the terminology of neck node levels and the guidelines for the surgical delineation of these levels proposed by the Committee for Head and Neck Surgery and Oncology of the American Academy for Otolaryngology-Head and Neck Surgery, recommendations are proposed for both the selection and the delineation of lymph node target volumes.","2158":"Radiation therapy, either alone or combined with surgery is a cornerstone in the treatment of oral cavity tumors. Target volumes to be treated with external beam radiation must take under consideration the initial tumor location, providing information on satellites lymph nodes to be irradiated as well. Modern imaging, with emphasis on CT scan with injection, is now mandatory for a better analysis of initial lesions including both tumor location and invaded lymph nodes. Tumor volumes based on clinical examination and CT scan analysis might be divided in two groups. First, volumes susceptible to receive a prophylactic irradiation for an hypothetical microscopic spread (CTV) to be treated with a prophylactic dose; second, volumes including lesions visible clinically or on CT scan that should receive a higher radiation dose (GTV). Clinical tolerance will largely be depending upon radiation-induced mucositis, impairing food intake. Radiation techniques aiming at normal tissues preservation should be used, including devices allowing keeping an open mouth during radiation delivery.","2159":"Nasal cavity and paranasal sinus carcinomas represent a small number of head and neck tumors (3 to 4%). Their management has been improved by modern imaging techniques to define operative procedures and deliver high-precision radiotherapy. Surgery is one of the most important components of treatment. Postoperative radiotherapy is indicated in all circumstances. A large proportion of patients with unresectable disease must be treated exclusively with radiotherapy. Definition of target volumes should be performed according to the knowledge of the natural outcome of the disease and modern 3D imaging. This is mandatory for treatment planning. Conformal radiotherapy significantly reduces the rate of complications, mainly eye toxicity.","2160":"Skull base tumours represent about 35 to 40% of all intracranial tumours. There are now many reports in the literature confirming the fact that about 80 to 90% of such tumours are controlled with fractionated radiotherapy. Stereotactic and 3-dimensional treatment planning techniques increase local control and central nervous system tolerance. Definition of the gross tumor volume (GTV) is generally easy with currently available medical imaging systems and computers for 3-dimensional dosimetry. The definition of the clinical target volume (CTV) is more difficult to appreciate; it is defined from the CTV plus a margin, which depends on the histology and anterior therapeutic history of the tumour. It is important to take into account the visible tumour and its possible extension pathways (adjacent bone, holes at the base of skull) and\/or an anatomic region (sella turcica + adjacent cavernous sinus). It is necessary to evaluate these volumes with CT Scan and MRI to appreciate tumor extension in a 3-dimentional approach, in order to reduce the risk of marginal recurrences. The aim of this paper is to discuss volume definition as a function of tumour site and tumour type to be irradiated.","2161":"Glioblastoma multiform and astrocytoma are the most frequent primary cancer of the central nervous system of adult. Definitions of gross tumor volume (GTV) and clinical target volume (CTV) are based on the confrontation of clinical presentation (age, performance status, neurologic symptoms...), histological type and imaging aspects. For glioblastoma multiform, the GTV can be defined by the area of contrast enhancement observed on the CT scan or MRI. Definition of the CTV can be more difficult and have to take into account the risk of presence of isolated malignant cells in the oedema surrounding the tumor or in the adjacent brain structures. The classical concept of GTV plus a safety margin of 2 cm around is discussed with a CTV containing at least all the oedematous area and eventually adjacent brain structures (nuclei, corpus callosum or other long associative fibers...). For low grade astrocytoma, the definition of GTV can be difficult if the tumoral infiltration is diffuse without nodular visible tumor. CTV corresponds to at least T2 MRI hypersignal area when visible. For postoperative tumor, technical considerations are important for the detection of residual tumor. A safety margin around the resected area is designed according to the risk of presence of isolated cells or involvement of adjacent brain structures.","2162":"Radiation therapy of prostate carcinoma with a curative intent implies to treat the whole prostate at high dose (at least 66 Gy). According to clinical stage, PSA level, Gleason's score, the clinical target volume may include seminal vesicles and less often pelvic lymph nodes. Microscopic extracapsular extension is found in 15 to 60% of T1-T2 operated on, specially in apex tumors. On contrary, cancers developing from the transitional zone may stay limited to the prostate even with a big volume and with a high PSA level. Zonal anatomy of the prostate identifies internal prostate, including the transitional zone (5% of the prostate in young people). External prostate includes central and peripheral zones. The inferior limit of the prostate is not lower than the inferior border of the pubic symphysis. Clinical and radiological examination: ultrasonography, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR), CT-scan identify prognostic factors as tumor volume, capsule effraction, seminal vesicles invasion and lymph node extension. The identification of the clinical target volume is now done mainly by CT-Scan which identifies prostate and seminal vesicles. NMR could be helpful to identify more precisely prostate apex. The definition of margins around the clinical target volume has to take in account daily reproducibility and organ motion and of course the maximum tolerable dose for organs at risk.","2163":"The radiotherapy of the breast or the chest wall is a complex technique. The definition of the gross tumour volume and the clinical target volume depends on clinical, anatomical and histological criteria. The volumes are located by physical examination, mammography, echography and tomodensitometry. The implantation of surgical clips in the lumpectomy cavity is useful for the boost field. The planning target volume takes into consideration movements of tissues during respiration and variations in beam geometry characteristics. The organs at risk (heart, lung) must be considered systematically. Technical contrivances are necessary to modify and homogenize dose distribution. Conformational irradiation allows an individually design treatment planning. Intensity-modulated radiotherapy technique is a future advantageous technique still under evaluation.","2164":"The total mesorectal excision allows the marked increase of the local control rate in rectal cancer. Therefore, the mesorectal space is the usual field for the spread of rectal cancer cells. It could therefore be considered as the clinical target volume in the preoperative plan by the radiation oncologist. We propose to identify the mesorectum on anatomical structures of a treatment-position CT scan.","2165":"Anatomical data of pancreas, biliary tree, regional lymph nodes is required to define GTV and CTV. In case of postoperative irradiation, CTV is designed in collaboration with radiation oncologist and surgeon oncologist. For exclusive radiotherapy, endodigestive ultrasonography, CT scan and MRI could help radiation oncologist defining GTV. Although, accuracy of all the imaging techniques in past years remains poor. Currently, no available literature is published regarding security margins for the definition of CTV. Therefore, recommendations according to clinical experience are proposed.","2166":"The spread of gastric adenocarcinoma may follow three main patterns: hematogenic, lymphatic and intraperitoneal. A GTV should be considered in preoperative or exclusive radiation therapy. After non-radical surgery, a \"residual GTV\" will be defined with the help of the surgeon. The CTV encompasses three intricated volumes. a) A \"tumor bed\" volume. After radical surgery, local recurrences appear as frequent as distant metastases. The risk depends upon the depth of parietal invasion and the nodal status. Parietal infiltration may extend beyond macroscopic limits of the tumor, especially in \"linitis plastica\". Therefore this volume will include: the tumor and the remaining stomach or their \"bed of resection\", a part of the transverse colon, the duodenum, the pancreas and the truncus of the portal vein. In postoperative RT, this CTV also includes the jejuno-gastric or jejuno-esophageal anastomosis. b) A peritoneal volume. For practical purposes, two degrees of spread must be considered: (1) contiguous microscopic extension from deeply invasive T3 and T4 tumors, that remain amenable to local sterilization with doses of 45-50 Gy, delivered in a CTV including the peritoneal cavity at the level of the gastric bed, and under the parietal incision; (2) true \"peritoneal carcinomatosis\", with widespread seeds, where chemotherapy (systemic or intraperitoneal) is more appropriate. c) A lymphatic volume including the lymph node groups 1 to 16 of the Japanese classification. This volume must encompass the hepatic pedicle and the splenic hilum. In proximal tumors, it is possible to restrict the lower part of the CTV to the lymphatic volume, and therefore to avoid irradiation of large intestinal and renal volumes. In distal and proximal tumors, involvement of resection margins is of poor prognosis--a radiation boost must be delivered at this level. The CTV in tumors of the cardia should encompass the lower part of the thoracic esophagus and the corresponding posterior mediastinum. In tumors invading the distal esophagus, a more complete coverage of mediastinal lymph nodes should be considered, especially in patients in good general condition. In tumors of the gastric fundus, most of the left hemidiaphragm should be included, as well as the spleen and its hilum (or their resection bed). In proximal tumors without involvement of the lesser curvature, a full coverage of the hepatic pedicle is not necessary. In contrast, for distal tumors, the hepatic pedicle and the hepatoduodenal ligament should be included whereas the splenic area could be spared. Planning the treatment of gastric cancer remains difficult; target volumes must be customized by experienced radiation oncologists according to tumoral and clinical situation. ","2167":"The oesophagus is divided into four regions: cervical oesophagus, and intrathoracic oesophagus with an upper, mid- and lower thoracic portion. Cancer may occur on each of these regions. Computed tomography of the thorax and superior abdomen and endoscopic ultrasound are necessary for reliable staging. CT simulation allows accurate definition of tumour volume. GTV includes tumour volume and regional lymph nodes. CTV encompasses GTV plus a safety margin and lymph node areas considered to harbour potential microscopic disease. The extent of prophylactic lymph node irradiation depends on the anatomic location of the primary tumour.","2168":"The recent evolutions of the imaging modalities, the dose calculation models, the linear accelerators and the portal imaging permit to improve the quality of the conformal radiation therapy treatment planning. With DICOM protocols, the acquired imaging data coming from different modalities are treated by performant image fusion algorithms and yield more precise target volumes and organs at risk. The transformation of the clinical target volumes (CTV) to planning target volumes (PTV) can be realised using advanced probabilistic techniques based on clinical experience. The treatment plans evaluation is based on the dose volume histograms. Their precision and clinical relevance are improved by the multi-modality imaging and the advanced dose calculation models. The introduction of the inverse planning systems permitting to realise modulated intensity radiation therapy generates highly conformal dose distributions. All the previously cited complex techniques require the application of rigorous quality assurance programs.","2169":"In the field of oncology, surgical pathology analysis of biopsies or surgical specimens directly determines the care program of each patient. Without going into too much detail, we report here the description of different characteristics of neoplastic lesions, necessary or useful for the establishment of the care program of the patients. These macroscopic and microscopic analyses should result in the most precise possible diagnosis and should take into account a list of other factors which allow the development of an optimal strategy for therapy, and the establishment of prognosis of the tumor. These characteristics include properties of the tumor such as the size, shape, exact location, and the grade of the lesion, etc. They also concern the relationship of the tumor to certain structures like the basal membranes, the stroma reaction, the lymphatic vessels, the nerves, and so forth. The description of local and locoregional spreading, as well as the analysis of the surgical margins gives essential information as well. Finally, in certain cases, the description of modifications induced by neoadjuvant therapy allows the evaluation of the treatment's efficacy.","2170":"Tumours treated with radioactive implants are in most cases small and accessible to clinical examination or endoscopy. Gross tumour volume is consequently mainly determined clinically or with endoscopy. Imaging may also be useful, with classical techniques, as mammography, or with CT-scan or MRI. Clinical target volume includes gross tumour volume and a 5-10 mm margin. Distribution of dose is estimated on the basis of images performed after implantation, classically with two orthogonal films of the implant. It can then be optimised. Dose-volume histogram of gross tumour volume and critical organs can be obtained with a CT-scan or a MRI of the implant, which may be difficult to perform because of implantation material and dummy sources.","2171":"Prescribing and achieving radiotherapy require accurate definitions of the target volumes and of the dose to be delivered in them. The need for the availability of a coherent vocabulary, recognized from local to international levels, has justified the publication, by the ICRU, of two reports related to external radiotherapy, the Report 50 (1993) and the Report 62 (1999). This paper presents the main propositions of the ICRU for the definition of the volumes, as well as comments and recommendations for their use.","2172":"Cataractogenesis is a widely reported late effect of irradiated crystalline lens. In this review the authors discussed the different aspects of radiation cataract pathogenesis, and the different mechanisms involved in the lens opacification, particularly the epithelium modifications such as epithelial cell death. The authors also reported the influence of radiation exposure on cataract formation following total body irradiation (TBI) and autologous or allogeneic bone marrow transplantation for hematologic malignancies. Moreover, the radiobiological parameters are not studied for the crystalline lens of human. We applied for the first time the linear-quadratic (LQ) and biological effective dose (BED) concept to TBI data. The calculated value of alpha\/beta of 1 Gy is in the range of the values reported for the other late responding tissues. The other risk factors for cataract development after TBI such as age, gender, central nervous system boost, long-term steroid therapy and heparin administration are discussed. In terms of cataract or sicca syndrome prevention, numerous compounds have been successfully tested in experimental models or used for the prevention of radiation-induced xerostomia in patients treated for head and neck cancer. However, none of them has been clinically evaluated for ocular radiation late effects prevention. In this report the authors discussed some of the radioprotectors potentially interesting for radiation-induced cataract or sicca syndrome prevention.","2173":"The 'Standards, Options and Recommendations' (SOR) project, started in 1993, is a collaboration between the Federation of the French Cancer Centres (FNCLCC), the 20 French cancer centres and specialists from French public universities, general hospitals and private clinics. The main objective is the development of clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of health care and outcome for cancer patients. The methodology is based on literature review and critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary group of experts, with feedback from specialists in cancer care delivery. To develop clinical practice guidelines according to the definitions of the Standards, Options and Recommendations project for the management of stage I and II non small cell lung carcinoma treated by radiotherapy alone. Data were identified by searching Medline and personal reference lists of members of the expert groups. Once the guidelines were defined, the document was submitted for review to independent reviewers, and to the medical committees of the 20 French cancer centres. The main recommendations for the management of stage I and II non small cell lung carcinoma treated by radiotherapy alone are: 1) The curative external irradiation with a continual course is an alternative to surgery only in the case of medically inoperable tumors or because the patient refuses surgery; 2) The external irradiation of the primary tumor only without the mediastinum could be proposed in peripheral stage IA. In proximal stage IA and IB, external irradiation should be carried out only as part of prospective randomised controlled trials comparing a localised irradiation of the primary tumor with a large irradiation of the mediastinum and the primary tumor. The treated volume must include the macroscopic tumoral volume with or without the microscopic tumoral volume and with a security margin from 1.5 to 2 cm; 3) There is a benefit to delivering a total dose in the primary tumor higher than 60 Gy in so far as the proposed irradiation, taking into account the respiratory function, does not increase the likelihood of severe adverse events due to radiation; and 4) The change in fractionation, the radiochemotherapy combination, the endobronchial brachytherapy with high dose rate alone or with external irradiation could be proposed only as part of prospective controlled trials for tumors classified as stage IB or II. ","2174":"Retrospective analysis of management and outcome of breast cancer in Madagascar. From January 1996 to December 1998, 259 women with breast cancer were seen in the only department of oncology of the island, located in Antananarivo. It is equipped with a cobalt unit (unavailable in 1996). There was no uniform policy on surgery. Chemotherapy and hormonotherapy were not available for all patients. Reduced equipment enabled a minimal pre-therapeutic workshop. Mean age was 48.5 years. One hundred and fifty-six women were premenopausal. The majority (69%) lived less than 50 km from the department. Tumours were at an advanced stage in 67% of the cases; the mean delay for diagnosis was 9.4 months. Treatments were done with curative intent in 118 cases and with palliative intent in 64 cases. Partial surgery (89) was adequate in 40.5% of the cases; total mastectomy concerned 94 women. Axillary lymph node dissection was done in 94 cases and was positive in 76 cases. The number of involved nodes was noticed in 47 cases. Curative radiotherapy concerned 106 patients, 41 after total mastectomy and 44 after lumpectomy, and was exclusive in 21 cases. Palliative irradiation was done locally with hypofractionation for 35 patients. Chemotherapy was performed in 86 women. The 4-year survival of the 136 assessable patients was 73%. Improvement in breast cancer treatment outcome in Madagascar is the result of earlier diagnosis of the disease. Information and education of the population together with caregivers are necessary, because updating and improving technical equipment is not currently possible due to the economic problems that the country has to face. ","2175":"To identify prognostic factors and treatment toxicity in a series of operable endometrial adenocarcinomas. Between November 1971 and October 1992, 437 patients (pts) with endometrial carcinoma, staged according to the 1988 FIGO staging system, underwent total abdominal hysterectomy and bilateral salpingo-oophorectomy without (n = 140) or with (n = 297) pelvic lymph node dissection. The chronology of RT was not randomized and depended on the usual practices of the surgical teams. Group I: 79 pts received preoperative uterovaginal brachytherapy (mean total dose [MD]: 57 Gy). Group II: 358 pts received postoperative RT (196 pts received vaginal brachytherapy alone [MD: 50 Gy], 158 pts had external beam pelvis RT [EPRT] [MD: 46 Gy over 5 weeks] followed by vaginal brachytherapy [MD: 17 Gy], and 4 pts had EPRT alone [MD: 46 Gy over 5 weeks]). The mean follow-up was 128 months. The 10-year disease-free survival rate was 86%. From 57 recurrences, 12 were isolated locoregionally. Multivariate analysis showed that independent factors decreasing the probability of disease-free survival were: histologic type (clear cell carcinoma, p = 0.038), largest histologic tumor diameter &gt; 3 cm (p = 0.015), histologic grade (p = 0.008), myometrial invasion &gt; 1\/2 (p = 0.0055), and 1988 FIGO staging system (p = 9.10(-8)). In group II, the addition of EPRT did not seem to improve locoregional control. The postoperative complication rate was 7%. The independent factors increasing the risk of postoperative complications were FIGO stage (p = 0.02) and pelvic lymph node dissection (p = 0.011). The 10-year rate for grade 3 and 4 late radiation complications according to the LENT-SOMA scoring system was 3.1%. EPRT independently increased the 10-year rate for grade 3 and 4 late radiation complications (R.R.: 5.6, p = 0.0096). EPRT increases the risk of late radiation complications. After surgical and histopathologic staging with pelvic lymph node dissection, in a subgroup of intermediate risk patients (stage IA grade 3, IB-C and II), postoperative vaginal brachytherapy alone is probably sufficient to obtain a good therapeutic index.

","2176":"Patients suffering from locally advanced unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the oropharynx and hypopharynx treated with radiotherapy alone have a poor prognosis. More than 70% of patients die within 5 years mainly due to local recurrences. The aim of this study was to evaluate retrospectively the Antoine Lacassagne Cancer Center's experience in a treatment by concomitant bid radiotherapy and chemotherapy. Evaluation was based on analysis of the toxicity, the response rates, the survival, and the clinical prognostic factors. From 1992 to 2000, 92 consecutive patients were treated in our single institution. All of them had stage IV, unresectable squamous cell carcinoma of the pharynx and they received continuous bid radiotherapy (two daily fractions of 1.2 Gy, 5 days a week, with a 6-h minimal interval between fractions). Total radiotherapy dose was 80.4 Gy on the oropharynx and 75.6 Gy on the hypopharynx. Two or three chemotherapy courses of cisplatin (CP)-5-fluorouracil (5FU) were given during radiotherapy at 21-day intervals (third not delivered after the end of the radiotherapy). CP dose was 100 mg\/m2 (day 1) and 5-FU was given as 5-day continuous infusion (750 mg\/m2\/day at 1st course; 430 mg\/m2\/day at 2nd and 3rd courses). Special attention was paid to supportive care, particularly in terms of enteral nutrition and mucositis prevention by low-level laser energy. Acute toxicity was marked and included WHO grade III\/IV mucositis (89%, 16% of them being grade IV), WHO grade III dermatitis (72%) and grade III\/IV neutropenia (61%). This toxicity was significant but manageable with optimised supportive care, and never led to interruption of treatment for more than 1 week, although there were two toxic deaths. Complete global response rate at 6 months was 74%. Overall global survival at 1 and 2 years was 72% and 50% respectively, with a median follow-up of 17 months. Prognostic factors for overall survival were the Karnofsky index (71% survival at 3 years for patients with a Karnofsky index of 90-100% versus 30% for patients with a Karnofsky index of 80% versus 0% for patients with a Karnofsky index of 60-70%, p = 0.0001) and tumor location (55% at 3 years for oropharynx versus 37% for panpharynx versus 28% for hypopharynx, p = 0.009). These results confirm the efficacy of concomitant bid radiotherapy and chemotherapy in advanced unresectable tumor of the pharynx. The improvement in results will essentially depend on our capacity to restore in a good nutritional status the patients before beginning this heavy treatment.

This hypothyroidism is infraclinical in 60% of the cases. Our study concerned 15 cases of hypothyroidism after external radiotherapy delivered between and 1991 and 1999. An irradiation of the cervical, cerebral and thorax regions was indicated for different types of cancers. Larynx carcinoma epidermoid was the most frequent cancer (seven cases); the radiation treatment used cobalt 60 with conventional fractionation, i.e., 2 Gy per treatment, five treatments a week. In nine cases, the hypothyroidism was discovered during a systematic examination; it was clinically evident in the six remaining cases. Hypothyroidism appeared after an irradiation dose average of 50 Gy (extremes 30-65 Gy). The average duration of the irradiation was about 7 weeks and the hypothyroidism appeared in a mean 22 months. In all cases, the substituting treatment was initiated with a favorable progression. Faced with the risk of hypothyroidism, it is necessary to check patients who have undergone external irradiation of the neck.","2180":"The paper deals with the recent improvements introduced in the most usual method applied in the Institut Gustave Roussy radiotherapy department for obtaining the anatomical data of patients treated for head and neck tumors. For each of these patients, five to seven transverses slices and a lateral radiographic film are taken from a Mecaserto simulator-CT. The anatomical representation of the patient sagittal plane is carried out from the digitalisation of the radiographic film on a Vidar Vxr-12 Plus film scanner and integrated into the Dosigray dose calculation programme in order to be used as a support for the laying out of the dose distribution in reference to the treatment. The sagittal anatomical representation obtained from the radiographic film digitalisation is compared with the one resulting from the interpolation between a limited number of irregularly-spaced transverse slices taken on the simulator-CT. The method using the simulator-scanner transverse slices and the radiographic film digitalisation represents an interesting alternative for obtaining an anatomy simulation representative of the patient in hospitals where a scanner is not available full-time for the needs of the radiotherapy process.","2181":"To retrospectively evaluate survival, progression-free survival (PFS) and biological response in a series of patients irradiated with mixed neutron\/photon beams for locally advanced prostate cancer in our institution. Three hundred and eight patients were treated between January 1990 and December 1996. Fifty-five of these were recruited for pT3 or pN1 tumors after radical prostatectomy. Neoadjuvant androgen deprivation was given in 106 patients. The treatment protocol consisted of a mixed photon\/neutron irradiation in a two-to-three proportion, up to a total equivalent dose of 66 Gy (assuming a clinical RBE value of 2.8). Pre- and post-treatment PSA determinations were available in practically all cases. Study endpoints were overall survival (OAS) and progression-free survival (PFS). The Cox proportional hazard regression model was used to investigate the prognostic value of baseline characteristics on survival and progression-free survival were a progression was defined as local, regional, metastatic or biological progression. Mean age was 69 years (49-86); mean pretreatment PSA was 15 (0.5-330) in all patients and 14 (0.5-160) in those receiving neoadjuvant hormonotherapy; seven patients only had an initial PSA &lt; or = 4 ng\/mL; 15% were T1, 46% were T2, 28% were T3 or pT3 and 4% were T4 (7% unspecified); WHO grade of differentiation was I in 38%, II in 38% and III in 14% (5% unspecified). The median follow-up was 2.8 years (0-7.8). Five-year overall survival (OAS) was 79% (95% CI: 71-87%) and 5-year progression-free survival (PFS) was 64% (95% CI: 54-74%) for the entire series. PFS in patients with an initial PSA &gt; or = 20 ng\/mL was the same. PFS could be predicted by two optimal Cox regression models, one including histological grade (p = 0.003) and initial PSA (p = 0.0009) as cofactors, the other including histological grade (p = 0.003) and T stage (p = 0.02). The main prognostic factors for overall survival were PSA and age. Biological responses with PSA &lt; 1.5 ng\/mL, &lt; 1 ng\/mL and &lt; 0.5 ng\/mL at any time after treatment were documented in 70%, 61% and 47% of the patients, respectively. Five-year OAS was 79%, PFS was 64%, and biological response was 70% for prostate cancer patients treated with mixed photon\/neutron beams as applied at Louvain-la-Neuve, which are good results as compared with the literature. The usual prognostic factors were confirmed. ","2182":"To evaluate, qualitatively and quantitatively, the role of surgical clips in planning the tumor bed electron or brachytherapy boost in patients undergoing breast-conserving surgery and radiotherapy. In 60 patients with breast cancer stage I or II, the excision cavity boundaries were marked by clips at surgery. Patients received a boost with brachytherapy (n = 51) or electron beam (n = 9) after whole breast irradiation. The boost target volume was first planned using clinical, mammography and operative information and its accuracy evaluated by screening the surgical clips and, if necessary, adjusting the field to encompass all clips and to include the scar. Dosimetry was retrospectively performed for each brachytherapy patient and for each surgical clip. It was necessary to modify the target volume field in 11 cases (18%). The average dose received by the surgical clips was 116.1% of the dose delivered to the reference isodose (median: 101.75%, range: 16-457%). However, dose heterogeneity was important in the same patient and between patients. Delineation of the boost target volume with surgical clips is more accurate than with clinical landmarks alone but this technique does not allow measurements of the clip-chest wall and clip-skin distances. Virtual simulation with CT-scan cuts is recommended for optimising boost planning. ","2183":"To directly compare the clinical efficacy of electronic to film portal images and the advantages of comparing directly on the monitor the simulation image and the portal image. This study was designed to compare clinical efficacy of electronic to film portal images acquired using a liquid matrix ion-chamber electronic portal imaging device (EPID) and a conventional film system. Two radiation oncologists served as observers and evaluated a total of 30 sets of images for three different treatment sites: lung, pelvis, and head\/neck. Each set of images included a simulation image, a portal film, a video paper print of electronic portal images, and a video prints of electronic portal images. Four to six anatomical landmarks were selected from each treatment site. Each observer was asked to rate each landmark in terms of its clinical visibility and to rate the ease of making the pertinent verification decision in the corresponding electronic and film portal images with the aid of the simulation image. The time needed to obtain and analyse a conventional portal image and an EPID would be analysed for the radiotherapist and the medical technicians. Ratings for the visibility of landmarks and for the verification decision of treatment ports were similar for electronic and film images for most landmarks. However, vertebral bodies and several landmarks in the pelvis such as the acetabulum and pubic symphysis were more visible in the electronic portal images than in the portal film images. For the medical technicians, the EPID is more comfortable, and they do not need to develop any images. The visibility of landmarks in electronic portal images is comparable to that in film portal images. Verification of treatment ports based only on electronic portal images acquired using an electronic portal imaging device is generally achievable. Thus the integration of the EPID and simulation image in a network provides more flexibility in the daily work of a medical radiotherapy team.

Patients treated between 1\/10\/98 and 1\/4\/99 by irradiation for cerebral tumours were analysed. For each case, we planned PT2D using conventional orthogonal x-ray films, and afterward, PT3D using CT scan. Gross tumor volume, planning target volume and normal tissue volumes were defined. Dose was prescribed according to report 50 of the International Commission on Radiation Units and Measurements (ICRU). We compared surfaces of sagittal view targets defined on PT2D and PT3D and called them S2D and S3D, respectively. Irradiated volumes by 90% isodoses (VE-90%) and normal tissue volumes irradiated by 20, 50, 90% isodoses were calculated and compared using Student's paired t-test. There was a concordance of 84% of target surfaces defined on PT2D and PT3D. Percentages of target surface under- or-over defined by PT2D were 16 and 13% respectively. VE-90% was decreased by 15% (p = 0.07) with PT3D. Normal brain volume irradiated by 90% isodose was decreased by 27% with PT3D (p = 0.04). For radiotherapy of cerebral tumors using only coplanar beams, PT3D leads to a reduction of normal brain tissue irradiated. We recommend PT3D for radiotherapy of cerebral tumors, particularly for low-grade or benign tumors (meningiomas, neuromas, etc.). ","2185":"Cerebral meningiomas account for 15-20% of all cerebral tumours. Although seldom malignant, they frequently recur in spite of complete surgery, which remains the cornerstone of the treatment. In order to decrease the probability of local recurrence, radiotherapy has often been recommended in atypical or malignant meningioma as well as in benign meningioma which was incompletely resected. However, this treatment never was the subject of prospective studies, randomized or not. The purpose of this review of the literature was to give a progress report on the results of different published series in the field of methodology as well as in the techniques of radiotherapy. Proposals for a therapeutic choice are made according to this analysis. For grade I or grade II-III meningiomas, limits of gross tumor volume (GTV) include the tumour in place or the residual tumour after surgery; clinical target volume (CTV) limits include gross tumour volume before surgery with a GTV-CTV distance of 1 and 2 cm respectively. Delivered doses are 55 Gy into CTV and 55-60 Gy and 70 Gy into GTV for grade I and grade II-III meningiomas respectively.","2186":"","2187":"","2188":"","2189":"","2190":"","2191":"","2192":"","2193":"","2194":"","2195":"","2196":"","2197":"","2198":"","2199":"To develop clinical practice guidelines according to the definitions of the Standards, Options and Recommendations project for the radiotherapy of carcinoma of the endometrium.

The main recommendations for the radiotherapy of carcinoma of the endometrium are: 1) For grade 1 and 2 stage IA tumours, follow-up alone is standard as additional treatment. For grade 1 and 2 stage IB tumours, vaginal brachytherapy or follow-up alone are options. For grade 3, stage IB tumours and stage IC disease, there are two treatment options: external pelvic radiotherapy with a brachytherapy boost or vaginal brachytherapy. 2) Treatment for stage II disease can be preoperative when stage II disease has been suggested by a positive endometrial curettage. Postoperative vaginal brachytherapy is given for stage IIA tumours if the penetration of the myometrium is less than 50% or if the tumour is grade 1 or 2. In the case of deep penetration, or higher grade disease, or for stage IIB external radiotherapy with brachytherapy boosting must be undertaken routinely. 3) After surgery, for stage IIIA disease, either external pelvic radiotherapy or abdomino-pelvic radiotherapy is indicated, along with medical treatment in certain patients. For stage IIIB tumours, postoperative external radiotherapy with brachytherapy (if possible) should be undertaken. For stage IIIC tumours, standard treatment is external (pelvic or pelvic and para-aortic) radiotherapy followed or not by a brachytherapy boost. In case of extrauterine sites involved abdomino-pelvic irradiation is recommended. 4) Standard treatment for inoperable stage I and II disease is external radiotherapy and brachytherapy. For patients with inoperable stage III or IV disease, treatment is often symptomatic, combining external radiotherapy and medical treatment.

Our retrospective study concerns patients with histologically proven primitive sinonasal lymphoma diagnosed and treated at our institution from 1975 to 1997. Initial work-up included: clinical plus ENT examination, WBC, ESR, LDH, abdominal ultrasonography, bone marrow biopsy and facial CT-scan taken since 1985. All slides are reviewed and reclassified using the Kiel system. Treatment is based on radiotherapy with or without chemotherapy (mainly with the CHOP protocol). We collected 25 patients (22 males and three females, sex-ratio = 7) with a mean age of 48 years (18 to 78). Mean delay of consultation is 4 months and patients consulted mainly for nasal obstruction (65%), more rarely epistaxis (40%) or rhinorrhea. ENT examination showed a fungating nasal fossa tumor in 20% of cases, predominantly unilateral (80%), associated to cervical nodes in 25% of cases. High-grade lymphomas represented 60% of the cases, and 60% of the patients were stage IE. All stage IEs have been treated by exclusive radiotherapy while more advanced stages received combined chemo- and radiotherapy (eight patients). The five-year actuarial survival rate was 69% for the whole population, with a better prognosis for localized stage and low-grade lymphomas. Radiotherapy remains a standard treatment for sinonasal lymphomas, permitting us to cure localized stages. In extended stages (more than IE), combined chemoradiotherapy seems to be a good option, especially in case of bulky tumors as observed for the other nodal and extra-nodal head and neck lymphomas. ","2203":"To evaluate dosimetric consequences generated by the automatic definition based on lesion coverage of prescription isodose. A clinical series of 124 arteriovenous malformations was analysed. Plan quality was quantified by the standard deviation of the differential dose volume histogram calculated in the lesion. We define two quantitative protocols based on lesion coverage for the automatic definition of prescription isodose using a volumetric definition of coverage (90% of lesion volume), and an isodose-based definition proposed by RTOG (prescription isodose equals minimum isodose in the lesion divided by 0.9). We have evaluated the plans obtained for these two protocols, calculating several dose-volume indices. These indices are presented as a function of dose-volume histogram standard deviation in order to quantify the consequences of their variations for this representative series of plans. The margin our team tolerates is such that the sum of underdosed lesion and overdosed healthy tissues factors remains lower than one. Protocol based on volumetric coverage gives results situated within this margin. Protocol based on RTOG definition produces conformation indices that could be greater than 1. The absolute dose would be decided taking into account examined dose-volume indices and clinical data. A protocol for automatic definition of prescription isodose using volumetric lesion coverage seems to be more judiciously adapted to arteriovenous malformation conformal plans in stereotactic conditions because of variations observed in the overdosage of healthy tissues. ","2204":"To assess late effects and quality of life in patients treated by three times daily (t.i.d.) radiotherapy with or without alternating chemotherapy for locally advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the head and neck. Between 1986 and 1991, 153 patients with locally advanced tumors have been included in a phase I\/II study consisting of t.i.d. radiotherapy (4 h. between fractions) of 2 Gy\/fraction to a total dose of 60 Gy, alternated or not with combination chemotherapy. The first group of patients received radiotherapy alone, the other group received combined modality. Ninety-two patients were eligible for late effect assessment: 61 in the combined modality group and 31 in the radiation therapy only group. The median follow-up was 45 months. All patients have been assessed according to the follow-up clinical records using the RTOG\/EORTC classification. Twenty-nine patients, who were alive at the time of our study, received a questionnaire on their quality of life, and were invited for a clinical evaluation using the SOMA-LENT scale. Ninety percent of the patients treated by radiation therapy alone developed one or more late complications. Overall, 47% of the patients have developed severe complications (grade III and IV): 42% in the group treated by radiation therapy alone and 49% in the group treated with combined modality. In the group treated by radiation therapy alone, the most commonly damaged organs were the mucosa (83%), skin (51%) and salivary glands (42%). We observed one case of osteonecrosis and one case of radiation myelitis. In the combined modality group, 95% of patients developed one or more late sequelae, of which 79% had skin, 51% mucosa and 42% salivary gland late effects, respectively. We observed four cases of osteonecrosis. Quality of life and overall physical condition of the patients have been judged to be average by self-questionnaire. Assessment according to the SOMA-LENT scale showed serious late effects mainly at the level of the salivary glands, mandibles and teeth. Correspondence between the RTOG\/EORTC and the SOMA-LENT scale was mediocre. This unconventional 4-h three times daily radiotherapy protocol resulted in very severe late effects on normal tissue. However, combination with chemotherapy resulted in minimal additional toxicity. We emphasise that the SOMA-LENT scale is neither simple to use nor easy to interpret. Quality of life is a very subjective notion and is not necessarily correlated with the objective seriousness of complications. ","2205":"Comprehension of cell cycle regulation mechanisms has progressed very quickly these past few years and regulators of the cell cycle have gained widespread importance in cancer. This review first summarizes major advances in the understanding of the control of cell cycle mechanisms. Examples of how this control is altered in tumoral cells are then described. The typical mammalian cell cycle consists of four distinct phases occurring in a well-defined order, each of which should be completed successfully before the next begins. Progression of eukaryotic cells through major cell cycle transitions is mediated by sequential assembly and activation of a family of serine-threonine protein kinases, the cyclin dependent kinases (CDK). The timing of their activation is determined by their post-translational modifications (phosphorylations\/dephosphorylations), and by the association of a protein called cyclin, which is the regulatory subunit of the kinase complex. The cyclin family is divided into two main classes. The 'G1 cyclins' include cyclins C, D1-3, and E, and their accumulation is rate-limiting for progression from the G1 to S phase. The 'mitotic or G2 cyclins', which include cyclin A and cyclin B, are involved in the control of G2\/M transition and mitosis. The cyclins bind to and activate the CDK, which leads to phosphorylation (and then inhibition) of the tumor suppressor protein, pRb. pRb controls commitment to progress from the G1 to S phase, at least in part by repressing the activity of the E2F transcription factors known to promote cell proliferation. Both the D-type cyclins and their partner kinases CDK4\/6 have proto-oncogenic properties, and their activity is carefully regulated at multiple levels including negative control by two families of CDK inhibitors. While members of the INK4 family (p16INK4A, p15INK4B, p18INK4C, p19INK4D) interact specifically with CDK4 and CDK6, the CIP\/KIP inhibitors p21CIP1\/WAF1, p27KIP1 and p57KIP2 inhibit a broader spectrum of CDK. The interplay between p16INK4A, cyclin D\/CDK, and pRb\/E2F together constitute a functional unit collectively known as the 'pRb pathway'. Each of the major components of this mechanism may become deregulated in cancer, and accumulating evidence points to the 'pRb pathway' as a candidate obligatory target in multistep oncogenesis of possibly all human tumor types. Major advances in the understanding of cell cycle regulation mechanisms provided a better knowledge of the molecular interactions involved in human cancer. This progress has led to the promotion of new therapeutic agents presently in clinical trials or under development. Moreover, the components of the cell cycle are probably involved in other non-cancerous diseases and their role must be defined.

Between 1990 and 1996, 150 patients with ovarian cancer stage IA, IB grades G2-3, and all patients classified IC and IIA, who did not have evidence of residual disease after surgery, were randomized to two treatment branches: radiotherapy or chemotherapy (CH). In the radiotherapy branch (76 patients), a whole abdomen irradiation of 30 Gy in 24 fractions over 5 weeks, with a pelvic boost to 50 Gy, was delivered. In the chemotherapy branch (74 patients), there were six series of polychemotherapy separated with 3-weeks interval. In each series patients received association of cisplatin (50 mg\/m2, d1), adriamycin (50 mg\/m2, d1) and cyclophosphamide (500 mg\/m2, d1). The tolerance of the treatment was good and comparable in both groups. In the radiotherapy branch, three late grade G3 intestinal complications were observed (three bowel obstructions, which required surgery in two cases). The actuarial survival rate without evidence of disease was 81% at 5 years for both groups. In our series we found that histological grade had the strongest influence on survival prognosis; it was the only significant factor in a multivariate analysis.

","2224":"In most institutions, surgical excision remains the standard treatment of meningiomas and neurinomas; the aim of surgery is complete resection. However, total removal is not always feasible without significant morbidity and in some cases, the patient's condition contraindicates surgery. For incompletely excised tumors, recurrences will have consequences on neurological functions. There are now many reports in the literature confirming the fact that radiotherapy significantly decreases the incidence of recurrence of incompletely resected benign tumors and that it can replace surgery in some situations where an operation would involve considerable danger or permanent neurological damage: about 80 to 90% of such tumors are controlled with fractionated radiotherapy. Stereotaxic and three-dimensional treatment planning techniques increase local control and central nervous system tolerance so that the respective place of surgery and radiotherapy needs to be redefined, considering efficacy and morbidity of these two therapeutic means. In this article, we limit our remarks to fractionated radiotherapy and, after a review of the literature, we discuss the indications, volume evaluations and the techniques currently used.","2225":"The management of patients with malignant glioma aims at improving the duration and quality of life. It rests upon symptomatic (steroid therapy, anticonvulsants, etc.) and specific (chemotherapy, etc.) treatments. It also includes palliative care during the terminal phase of the disease. During the last 15 years, oligodendrogliomas have been demonstrated to be chemosensitive, leading to an improvement of their management; on the other hand, the treatment of glioblastoma multiforme remains disappointing. Development of new research pathways (gene therapy, immunotherapy, antiangiogenic drugs, etc.) feed new hopes for progress in the understanding and management of gliomas during the years to come.","2226":"Gliomas are moderately radiosensitive. The main prognostic factors are the anatomicopathological type and grade of glioma, the performance status, age of the patient and the extent of the surgery.

Surgery provides a pathology-based diagnosis that is mandatory in every patient with a clinical diagnosis of glial tumor. However, its role in duration of survival is controversial. Total surgical removal is the best prognostic factor in grade 1 glioma. For grade 2 to 4 gliomas, the results of surgery are variable. Surgical resection is undoubtedly associated with clinical improvement. Its impact on duration of survival is not firmly established, due to, on the one hand, the infiltrative pattern of these types of tumors and, on the other hand, to the inherent difficulty in evaluating their size either pre- or postoperatively. However, the sole clinical improvement related to surgical resection appears sufficient to justify patients' exposure to resective surgery. The surgical risk has dramatically decreased over the last few years mainly due to technical improvements.","2228":"This article deals with the potential benefits of portal imaging as a tool for the dosimetric control of a radiotherapy treatment.

Measurements with phantoms have shown that this relationship is complex: different algorithms have been developed by groups of researchers and some of them are summarised in this article.

Two recent randomized trials confirmed the benefit of well-adapted locoregional irradiation. In the Danish trial, including premenopausal \"high-risk\" women treated by mastectomy and chemotherapy (CMF protocol), the radiotherapy reduced the locoregional relapses from 32 to 9% (P &lt; 0.001) and increased the 10-year survival rates from 45 to 54% (P &lt; 0.001). These results are now also confirmed in a postmenopausal group, with an increased 10-year survival rate of 36 to 45% (P &lt; 0.001). In the Canadian trial, locoregional relapse rate decreased from 25 to 13% and 10-year survival rate increased from 56 to 65%. The meta-analysis published in 1995 by the Early Breast Cancer Trialist Collaborative Group (EBCTCG) showed only a modest benefit due to locoregional irradiation in breast cancer. However, when small trials and older trials started before 1970 are excluded due to imperfect methodologies and for inadequate irradiation techniques, the benefit of the \"modern\" radiotherapy appears significant in the 7,840 patients selected in this way. Thus, since the locoregional irradiation can avoid some metastatic evolutions developed only after \"local\" or \"nodal\" relapse, it must be integrated in a multidisciplinary strategy. Nevertheless, this treatment must be safe and this is possible by the use of new techniques, including the definition of anatomical volumes and previsional dosimetry. The most important point concerns the treatment of the internal mammary nodes, especially when previous chemotherapy including anthracyclines was performed. The use of a direct field, with at least 40% of the dose delivered by electrons in an alternating scheme, is recommended to ensure very good protection of the heart and lungs.","2235":"Since its initial description by Max Wilms over a century ago, nephroblastoma has benefited from considerable improvements both in terms of basic knowledge about it and management of it. Today, the majority of these very young patients can expect a long-term survival in excess of 90% at the price of a light therapy that combines surgical resection, chemotherapy based on ill-toxic agents, and in selected cases, radiotherapy of remarkably low toxicity. The contribution of large international studies will be emphasized here.","2236":"Prognosis of medulloblastoma remains serious with a disease-free survival rate of 70% at 5 years and severe sequelae in the majority of children. In order to improve this survival rate without unacceptable toxicity, various ways are currently under investigation. Among them, hyperfractionation and conformal therapy seem to be promising. Quality control of radiotherapy treatment could surely also play a major role on outcome.","2237":"Brachytherapy has been widely used at the Institut Gustave-Roussy since 1972 in pediatric oncology. In genitourinary rhabdomyosarcoma, because of its ballistic and physical characteristics, it represents the optimal treatment whenever irradiation is required and brachytherapy feasible. Between 1976 and 1998, 23 children with bladder or prostate rhabdomyosarcoma were treated with a protocol including brachytherapy, with five of them treated with a salvage brachytherapy. All but one brachytherapy was performed during the surgery. Among the 18 brachytherapies performed as a first-line treatment, eight presented a tumoral evolution: five presented a local evolution, one a local and nodal evolution and two a nodal evolution. Brachytherapy allowed a conservative treatment among ten out of 11 children alive with no evidence of disease. Among the five patients with salvage brachytherapy, two presented a second recurrence. Sequelae were minimal, consisting of one grade I rectitis and one asymptomatic vesical and ureteral reflux. These results are consistent with the published data using more radical treatment. Brachytherapy can represent an alternative to radical surgery, when indications are clearly defined in bladder or prostate rhabdomyosarcoma. This type of treatment can be performed only integrated with other treatments, more particularly with surgery. This approach requires a close cooperation between the different specialists: pediatricians, surgeons and brachytherapists.","2238":"Ewing sarcoma is an uncommon malignancy that has been frequently managed differently in childhood and adults. This is a review of the international experience that conducted to a common European study called Euro Ewing. This study was launched in 1999.","2239":"The optimisation of the field of irradiation is the aim of the radiotherapist. Pet-Scan provides information revealing a better cartography of node involvement and allowing a better delineation of the tumour zone. In the follow-up of irradiated patients, PET-Scan provides information on the nature of residual lesions and a possible recurrence.","2240":"For a long time, combined external irradiation and brachytherapy has been considered as the standard treatment in patients with advanced cervical cancers. Recently, five clinical randomized trials assessing the role of cis-platin-based chemotherapy delivered concomitantly to radiotherapy have been conducted in the United States. Another clinical randomized trial assessing the role of epirubicin was conducted by the Queen Mary Hospital in Hong Kong. With more than 2,000 enrolled patients, these studies showed converging results with an overall and disease-free survival improvement in the arms combining cis-platin and epirubicin-based chemotherapy and irradiation. These combinations led to a significant decrease in loco-regional evolution or recurrence rates, or even in pulmonary metastases rates. The relative risk of recurrences was decreased by 50%. The relative risk of death was decreased by 40%. The differences, however, were less significant in patients with advanced stages III or IVA. Hematological and digestive acute toxicity was significantly higher in the radiochemotherapy groups, but long-term complications were comparable. The results of these randomized trials have led to a modification in the standard of treatment in these poor prognosis cervix cancers. Five of the randomized trials evidenced the superiority of cis-platin-based chemotherapy, but the optimal chemotherapeutic regimens remain to be defined.","2241":"Recent improvement in the understanding of the mechanisms involved in the response to ionizing radiation have made it possible to identify new therapeutic targets to increase the anti-tumor efficacy or, alternatively, to decrease the effect on normal tissues. These approaches included targeting genes involved in the regulation of radio-induced DNA-repair and cell death as well as genes involved in the regulation of radio-induced apoptosis. Many other molecular targets have been recently identified to potentially interfere with the response to ionizing radiation, such as some cell membrane growth factor receptors (EGFr, TGFb) or molecules involved in intra-cellular signal transduction pathways, cell cycle regulation, etc. In addition, other promising ways to modulate radiation-induced response concern extracellular or tissue factors such as hypoxia and angiogenesis.","2242":"To describe the learning curve in prostate seed implantation, according to the experience with two groups of 100 patients. A perineal, ultrasound-guided implantation technique with manual afterloading was used in all patients. Of a total of 255 patients treated over the period 1989 through 1998, the results of the first hundred patients were compared in relation to the last hundred patients. In the first group single seeds were used, while in the second group RAPID Strands were applied. Although there is a difference in the follow-up period, a significant difference is found in disease-free survival between the two groups. PSA progression was noticed in 39% of patients in the first group and in 12% in the other group. The strongest prognostic factor, however, is the initial PSA value. Toxicity is relatively low, though higher in the second group. The results obtained in the second hundred patients are in agreement with data from literature. Differences in outcome between the two groups are, however, not only explained by differences in technique, but also by selection and total number of implanted seeds. ","2243":"3D-conformal-radiation therapy is now available according to progress in imaging and treatment planning. It gives three advantages: better coverage of clinical target volume, decrease of dose in organs at risk and in some cases possibility of escalating the dose in the clinical target volume. These three theoretical advantages are demonstrated for localized prostate adenocarcinomas. An increase of clinical and biological cure rate was demonstrated with 3D-CRT compared with conventional technique for the same dose. A decrease of acute and late complications was observed with 3D-CRT in historical comparisons and in randomized clinical trials. The most exciting point were the results of studies of escalating dose (+10 or 15%). There was a relationship between dose and clinical and biological cure rate. The french study of escalated dose showed a probability of clinical and biological cure rate at 36 months of 50% for doses between 66 and 70 Gy and 85% for doses between 74 and 80 Gy. In conclusion, 3D-CRT is becoming more and more important in the treatment of localized prostate carcinoma.","2244":"A radical prostatectomy for localized prostate cancer is indicated after evaluation of the disease (initial PSA, clinical stage, biopsy mapping, results of radiologic explorations with an endorectal MRI) and the patient (age, morbidity, life expectancy and wishes of potency conservation). The surgical approaches, retropubic or laparoscopic, depend on the surgeon's experience. Radical prostatectomy provides good disease-free survival for organ-confined disease close to the natural life expectancy. Post-radical prostatectomy morbidity is essentially represented by orthostatic incontinence (up to 6.8%), stress incontinence (up to 27%) and impotence (30 to 95%), depending on the published series and patient age.","2245":"Localized prostate cancer can be treated by surgery, 3D conformal radiotherapy, brachytherapy: age, clinical stage, Gleason grade, baseline PSA, multidisciplinary approach enable physicians to tailor the therapeutic strategy. Patients are more informed of therapeutic morbidity and health related quality of life and want to give their feeling. Clinical research remains mandatory to set up the treatment policy with more objectivity.","2246":"","2247":"Radio-induced tumor have been known for a long time to occur after treatment of cancer during childhood. This entity is exceptional following radiotherapy of the cavum. Skull and facial osteosarcoma were described after treatment of UCNT. We report two observations of radio-induced tumors arising, respectively three and seven years after treatment of UCNT. The first one is a temporoparietal glioblastoma and the second is a rhino- and pharyngeal myxoma. The two patients are alive after treatment of the second tumor. The delay of appearance of these tumors, their situation in the field's irradiated and dose received suggests their radio-induced nature. However, the cytogenetic study is necessary to confirm the implication of radiotherapy in the genesis of these cancers.","2248":"Hodgkin's disease is now curable in more than 50% of cases, due to its chemo- and radio-sensitivity. However, treatment exposes to a risk of secondary cancer varying from 1 to 10% depending on chemoradiotherapy doses and schedules. We report a case of secondary breast cancer associated with a secondary thyroid cancer observed in a 24-year-old man treated when he was 13 years old by vinblastin and radiation for stage IIA, a Hodgkin's disease.","2249":null,"2250":"The objective of this study was to assess the quality of information contained in the medical files of patients in an oncology unit of the Lyons Civil Hospices. Prior to the audit, the health care teams established a set of consensus standards to compare with observed procedures. The analysis of the results led to propositions for guidelines designed to improve points where significant deviations were observed. In the first audit, 80 medical files from patients cared for in four oncology units were retrospectively analysed to determine information quality. Seven items of this audit were retained for a second audit on 127 medical files of patients in a cancerology unit; those items were: postal code of birth place, weight, codified evaluation of general status, TNM classification, pTNM classification, presence of pathology report, localisation of metastasis. Significant deviations were observed for pTNM classification and postal code of birth. During the second audit, a manual of procedures was distributed in the unit, and a new evaluation will be done in one year to assess the impact of guidelines.","2251":"Intensity modulated radiation therapy (IMRT) is an advanced method of conformal radiotherapy. It permits optimal dose distribution to the target volume while preserving surrounding normal tissues. IMRT, with a multileaf collimator, can be realised in two different ways: either the segmented mode, which consists of combining small elementary static field, or the dynamic mode, which consists of moving the leaves while irradiating. The purpose of this work was to study these two methods of modulation on a Varian linear accelerator equipped with a collimator consisting of 40 pairs of one-centimetre-wide leaves. The measurements, obtained by using a diode array, showed that the quality of the irradiation in the dynamic mode does not depend on either the dose rate or the duration of the irradiation. In the segmented mode, weak magnitude segments are preferable, but increase the errors in the delivered dose. Comparisons of various profiles showed that the measured profiles are consistent with those programmed. Both modes seem to be equivalent for step-shaped profiles. In the case of profiles with constant slope, the segmentation generated by the segmented method deteriorates the profile. Even though the choice of technique is strongly dependent on the material available, the dynamic mode presents greater flexibility of use and has been chosen in our institution for IMRT.","2252":"Conformal radiation therapy allows the possibility of delivering high doses at the tumor volume whilst limiting the dose to the surrounding tissues and diminishing the secondary effects. With the example of the conformal radiation therapy used at the AZ VUB (3DCRT and tomotherapy), two treatment plans of a left ethmoid carcinoma will be evaluated and discussed in detail. The treatment of ethmoid cancer is technically difficult for both radiation therapy and surgery because of the anatomic constraints and patterns of local spread. A radiation therapy is scheduled to be delivered after surgical resection of the tumor. The treatment plan for the radiation therapy was calculated on a three-dimensional (3D) treatment planning system based on virtual simulation with a beam's eye view: George Sherouse's Gratis. An effort was made to make the plan as conformal and as homogeneous as possible to deliver a dose of 66 Gy in 33 fractions at the tumor bed with a maximum dose of 56 Gy to the right optic nerve and the chiasma. To establish the clinical utility and potential advantages of tomotherapy over 3DCRT for ethmoid carcinoma, the treatment of this patient was also planned with Peacock Plan. For both treatment plans the isodose distributions and cumulative dose volume histograms (CDVH) were computed. Superimposing the CDVHs yielded similar curves for the target and an obvious improvement for organs at risk such as the chiasma, brainstem and the left eye when applying tomotherapy. These results have also been reflected in the tumor control probabilities (equal for both plans) and the normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP), yielded significant reductions in NTCP for tomotherapy. The probability of uncomplicated tumor control was 52.7% for tomotherapy against 38.3% for 3DCRT.","2253":"Between 1988 and 1994, 326 patients with colorectal cancers were treated at the Ibn Rochd Oncology Centre in Casablanca; 88 patients were less than 40 years old (27%). There were 79 males and nine females. A family history of colorectal cancer was noted in 5%. The most frequent symptoms were bleeding and rectal pain. The localisation of the tumour was the rectum in 70 cases. According to the anatomopathological profile, Dukes stages C and D were the most frequent and mucosal adenocarcinoma was noted in 24 cases. Seventy patients had surgery, associated with radiation therapy in 59 cases. Adjuvant chemotherapy was given in 44 cases and palliative treatment in 17 cases. Recurrence occurred in 14 cases and metastasis in other six cases. At five years, overall survival and disease-free survival rates were 24% and 17%, respectively. Worse prognostic factors were mucosal adenocarcinoma, poor differentiated adenocarcinoma and Dukes C and D stages.","2254":"The aim of this prospective study is the feasibility of late effects assessment by LENT-SOMA scales after conservative treatment of soft tissue sarcomas of the extremities and a comparison with the functional evaluation by the Enneking score. During the systematic follow-up consultations, a series of 32 consecutive patients was evaluated in terms of late effects by LENT-SOMA scales and functional results by the Enneking score. The median time after treatment was 65 months. The treatment consisted of conservative surgery (all cases) followed by radiation therapy (29 cases), often combined with adjuvant therapy (12 concomitant radio-chemotherapy association cases out of 14). The assessment of the toxicity was retrospective for acute effects and prospective for the following late tissue damage: skin\/subcutaneous tissues, muscles\/soft tissues and peripheral nerves. According to the Enneking score, the global score for the overall series was high (24\/30) despite four the scores zero for the psychological acceptance. According to LENT-SOMA scales, a low rate of severe sequellae (grade 3-4) was observed. The occurrence of high-grade sequellae and their functional consequences were not correlated with quality of exerese, dose of radiotherapy or use of concomitant chemotherapy. A complementarity was observed between certain factors of the Enneking score and some criteria of the LENT-SOMA scales, especially of muscles\/soft tissues. The good quality of functional results was confirmed by the two mean scoring systems for late normal tissue damage. The routine use of LENT-SOMA seems to be more time consuming than the Enneking score (mean time of scoring: 13 versus five minutes). The LENT-SOMA scales are aimed at a detailed description of late toxicity and sequellae while the Enneking score provides a more global evaluation, including the psychological acceptance of treatment. The late effects assessment by the LENT-SOMA scales should be carried on in prospectives studies, especially in case of concomitant radio-chemotherapy. ","2255":"The changes that occur in the tissular microcirculation after accidental acute irradiation account for some of the early effects of such irradiation, especially at the cutaneous level. The prognostic importance of the cutaneous laser doppler was tested in an experimental model of acute beta-irradiation. Ten pigs were given beta-irradiation with a high single localized dose of 90Sr\/90Y (32 or 64 Gy, 7 mg\/cm2) delivered to the flank, and were evaluated 2, 7, 14, 21 and 28 days thereafter. Each individual was its own control. The local microcirculation was measured in the resting state and during thermal stimulation at 42 degrees C, using a Periflux cutaneous Doppler laser with p413 probes. Three periods of six minutes each were continuously recorded: period 1 (P1) represented basal resting cutaneous perfusion, with the slope p corresponding to the increase in perfusion when two minutes of thermal stimulation at 42 degrees C began; P2 to plateau perfusion during this stimulation; and P3 to perfusion on the return to equilibrium. After acute beta-irradiation in the pig, all the cutaneous microcirculation parameters measured (P1, p, P2 and P3) had risen at day 2 in the irradiated area by a factor of 2 to 4, depending on the dose (p &lt; 0.001), compared to the adjacent control area. On the other hand, as from day 7, the resting and the stimulated microcirculation varied little, except for a reduction of the slope p by a factor of 2 (p &lt; 0.05) after the strongest radiation dose. After acute irradiation, the increase in the resting cutaneous microcirculation may correspond to immediate but transitory capillary vasodilatation that accompanies the initial erythema in accidental irradiation. The absence of vascular response to thermal stimulation seems to be a good means of reaching an early diagnosis of delayed cutaneous radiation necrosis. ","2256":"The changes that occur in the tissular microcirculation after therapeutic irradiation (RT) account for some of the late effects of irradiation, especially on the cutaneous level. As a rule, the methods of exploring the superficial microcirculation only measure blood flow indirectly. Only the Doppler laser can provide direct measurements of blood parameters in vivo in man. Thirty women who had been irradiated with 45 + 20 Gy of locoregional fractionated adjuvant RT for breast cancer developed local radiation-induced fibrosis six years later (+\/- 5). The local microcirculation was measured in the resting state and during thermal stimulation at 42 degrees C, using a Periflux cutaneous Doppler laser with p413 probes. Three periods of six minutes each were continuously recorded: period 1 (P1) represented basal resting cutaneous perfusion, with the slope p corresponding to the increase in perfusion when two minutes of thermal stimulation at 42 degrees C began; P2 to plateau perfusion during this stimulation; and P3 to perfusion on the return to equilibrium. Each individual was its own control. In the women treated by RT, the resting microcirculation in the skin underlying an area of late fibrosis rose by a factor of 2 during P1 (p &lt; 0.001), and the P2\/P1 ratio decreased by a factor of 2 (p &lt; 0.001), compared to the control area. After thermal stimulation, there was no change in p, P2 or P3. Although a hypovascularization is frequently found in late sequelae of RT, we observed an increase of the cutaneous microcirculation associated with a maladjustment of the endothelial response to a thermal stimulation. These observations seem to reflect the presence of dilated new capillaries of the telangiectatic type, which are macroscopically undetectable. ","2257":"Validation of biological dosimetry versus physical dosimetry in malignant haemopathy patients conditioned by total body irradiation (TBI) before bone marrow transplantation (BMT). The scoring of chromosomal aberrations in peripheral lymphocytes irradiated in vivo was used to perform the biological dosimetry. The data were compared to those obtained with healthy volunteers' total blood exposed to in vitro irradiation with linear accelerator doses (0.2, 0.5, 0.75, 1, 2, 3, 4 and 5 Gy) for dose-response curves. In experimental animal models, can in vivo and in vitro responses be considered as being the same? All the published human data are based on retrospective dose evaluation with very large uncertainties on the dose precisely delivered to the subject. TBI before BMT was taken as a model where the dose calculation results from the physical method, with homogeneous beam and dose delivered precisely along the entire organism. In vivo response allows us to validate biological dosimetry in 15 adult patients (female + male), before (D = 0 Gy) and after the first fraction of 1.8 Gy, delivered by a linear accelerator (18 MV, dose-rate of 15.8 cGy\/min-1). Two methods, conventional cytogenetics (CCG) and fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH painting) of chromosome 4 were respectively used to analyze the unstable chromosome aberrations and stable chromosome aberrations. Healthy volunteer lymphocytes, before irradiation, yielded 0.1% dicentrics and 0.3% translocations of chromosome 4, with 2.5% for the whole genome. Patients before irradiation had 2% dicentrics and 11.48% chromosome 4 translocations for the whole genome. In the 15 patients, for a physical dose of 1.8 Gy, the evaluated biological dose was 1.93 Gy (95% CI: 1.85-2.05 Gy) with conventional cytogenetics and 2.06 Gy (95% CI: 1.75-2.15 Gy) with FISH. These results, in which the biologically estimated dose is in complete agreement with the dose calculated by physical dosimetry in the homogeneous irradiation model, suggest the validation of biological dosimetry in TBI conditioning. ","2258":"Over the last ten years the impact of fundamental radiation biology into daily radiotherapy has been of concern chiefly to fractionation, prediction of radiation response, tumour oxygenation, intrinsic radiosensitivity including genetic approaches, and the determinants of the outcome of chemoradiotherapy combinations.

Some of these novel advances will be discussed.","2259":"Radiation-induced fibrosis is a late sequela of both therapeutic and accidental irradiations, which has been described in various tissues, including the lung, liver, kidney and skin. This review presents different aspects of superficial radiation-induced fibrosis, such as clinical observations, histological changes, cellular and molecular regulations, and medical management. Recent evidence on the critical role played by TGF-beta 1 in the initiation, development and persistence of fibrosis are discussed, as well as the possibility that this cytokine may constitute a specific target for antifibrotic agents.","2260":"Tight control of cell proliferation is mandatory to prevent cancer formation as well as to normal organ development and homeostasis. This occurs through checkpoints that operate in both time and space and are involved in the control of numerous pathways including DNA replication and transcription, cell cycle progression, signal transduction and differentiation. Moreover, evidence has accumulated to show that apoptosis is tightly connected with the regulation of cell cycle progression. In this paper we describe the main pathways that determine checkpoints in the cell cycle and apoptosis. It is also recalled that in solid tumors radiation-induced cell death occurs most frequently through non-apoptotic mechanisms involving oncosis, and mitotic or delayed cell death.","2261":"Cells of higher eukaryotes possess several very efficient systems for the repair of radiation-induced lesions in DNA. Different strategies have been adopted at the cellular level to remove or even tolerate various types of lesions in order to assure survival and limit the mutagenic consequences. In mammalian cells, the main DNA repair systems comprise direct reversion of damage, excision of damage and exchange mechanisms with intact DNA. Among these, the direct ligation of single strand breaks (SSB) by a DNA ligase and the multi-enzymatic repair systems of mismatch repair, base and nucleotide excision repair as well as the repair of double strand breaks (DSB) by homologous recombination or non homologous end-joining are the most important systems. Most of these processes are error-free except the non homologous end-joining pathway used mainly for the repair of DSB. Moreover, certain lesions can be tolerated by more or less accurately acting polymerases capable of performing translesional DNA syntheses. The DNA repair systems are intimately integrated in the network of cellular regulation. Some of their components are DNA damage inducible. Radiation-induced mutagenesis is largely due to unrepaired DNA damage but also involves error-prone repair processes like the repair of DSB by non-homologous end-joining. Generally, mammalian cells are well prepared to repair radiation-induced lesions. However, some questions remain to be asked about mechanistic details and efficiencies of the systems for removing certain types of radiation-damage and about their order and timing of action. The answers to these questions would be important for radioprotection as well as radiotherapy.","2262":"","2263":"","2264":"","2265":"","2266":"","2267":"","2268":"","2269":"","2270":"To evaluate the level of understanding and the impact of the information booklet \"For a better understanding of radiotherapy\" for radiotherapy patients. A survey by questionnaire was realized during the second semester 1999 with ten centers of radiotherapy in the Aquitaine area. One hundred booklets with a questionnaire and a postage-paid envelope were sent to the oncologists of these ten radiotherapy centers. A quantitative analysis of the questionnaires received and a qualitative analysis by anthropological methods (a prior reading of the document with 13 patients and a content analysis of the questionnaires, in particular of the free texts in it) were performed. The response rate was 10.8% for the quantitative analysis. The different actors in radiotherapy were partly identified: the oncologist and the technicians were clearly identified by 84.3% of the patients. However, their role seemed to be less discerned. The information given in the booklet was considered clear for 57.4% of the patients; 74.2% did not require explanations of the vocabulary, whereas 14.8% wanted explanations and 13.0% did not state an opinion. In the qualitative analysis, the booklet was found to be well received and understood even if technical explanations were sometimes needed. However, words in italics or small print and pictures without captions impeded the proper reading of the booklet. Finally, the personal real-life context of the patients was more present in comments during the reading with the anthropologist and in the free texts (which represented 26.9% of the received questionnaires). This booklet was judged to be useful by the patients and thought to \"answer the questions which the patient may ask\". It seems important to define the right moment for its distribution (the first visit, the first sequence of treatment, for example, would be more appropriate). Lastly, certain passages, especially in the introduction, could be modified so as to improve the legibility (in particular for the elderly). In addition, the informative content, largely well understood, could be extended with a glossary, using simple technical and always clear explanations.

This present study appraises the pertinence of the form and substance of this booklet one year after its release. Eight radiotherapy centers participated in this research which evaluated 162 patients at treatment initiation. The conclusions of this study demonstrated the importance of clearly informing patients of their disease, treatment, and the secondary effects of treatment. It is essential to emphasize that 97% of the patients declared that an information booklet is a real necessity, and that the one provided by the SFRO responds to the majority of their concerns. Obtaining technical and practical knowledge resulted in a reassurance about their treatment. The most revealing result is that 87% requested direct communication about their illness, and that cancer be named by this word and not other, evasive terms. Seventy-two percent of the patients requested more information about their cancer, different treatment options, and quality of life issues in an attempt to psychologically prepare themselves to face an illness for which they have little control.

These can be important causes of treatment failure. Immobilization devices have only been studied recently in a scientific manner in the domain of chest tumors, presumably because other factors such as tumor motion were felt to be more important causes of treatment uncertainties. An international survey on immobilization devices in the treatment of non-small cell lung cancer has shown that about half of the centers are using three-dimensional conformal radiotherapy, and among these, only two-thirds use immobilization devices on a routine basis. Very few use internal fiducials. Current data on set-up errors show that the average discrepancy is about 5 mm, but in some cases it can be more than 15 mm. A recent study has demonstrated that less positioning corrections during treatments were needed for the patients who were immobilized. Another work indicates that there were no differences between a T-bar immobilization device and a system using chemical foams. Other works indicate that internal motion of bronchial tumors can vary greatly, depending on their location. A number of clinical groups are looking at minimizing the consequences of internal motion, but the currently proposed techniques appear to be cumbersome. New studies will be necessary in order to improve the knowledge of daily positioning and the effect of internal motion. Until then, it is essential to take care when considering narrow margins in conformal radiotherapy of non-small cell lung cancer.","2274":"Keloid scars are unsightly, especially when located on the face or bare zones. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the therapeutic results of intraoperative brachytherapy in the management of keloids. This retrospective study was based on the study of 82 patients with keloids treated in Salah Azaiz Institute (Tunisia) between 1982 and 1994 (65 women and 17 men). The mean age of patients was 23.4 years (+\/- 8.4). A total of 114 lesions have been treated with surgical resection and intraoperative brachytherapy using an iridium source placed under the surgical scar. The length of iridium was chosen with the result that the radioactive thread exceeded 5 mm on each side of the surgical scar. The iridium source was loaded less than six hours after resection. Average iridium activity was 1.5 +\/- 0.3 mCi\/cm. Average iridium length was 56.8 +\/- 34 mm. The referred isodose chosen for the target volume included the surgical scar and a margin of 5 mm around the iridium source, which was placed under the surgical scar. The average administered dose was 20.4 Gy (+\/- 3.2 Gy). The 2-year local control rate was 87% for the whole group of lesions treated (n = 114). Local control rate of keloids processed by resection and intraoperative brachytherapy as the first treatment (59 cases) was 96% at two years. This rate was better than the local control of lesions that had been previously treated with anterior surgical resection (84% in 55 cases). For the latter group, lesions treated with a dose of more than 20 Gy had better local control, but the difference was not statistically significant (87 vs. 65% at two years, P = 0.41). Intraoperative brachytherapy is effective for improving local control of keloids and preventing a recurrence. A rigorous technique and an adequate dose according to previous surgical treatment allows very good results. ","2275":"Based on encouraging results reported in alternating radiotherapy and chemotherapy in inflammatory breast carcinoma, we have tried in this study to optimize locoregional treatment with a hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy schedule alternating with chemotherapy. From May 1991 to May 1995, 54 patients, previously untreated, with non-metastatic inflammatory breast cancer were entered in an alternating protocol consisting of eight courses of combined chemotherapy and two series of loco-regional hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy with a total dose of 66 Gy. Hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy was started after three courses of neoadjuvant chemotherapy (Adriamycin, Vincristine, Cyclophosphamide, Methotrexate, 5-fluoro-uracile) administered every 21 days +\/- G.CSF. The first series delivered 45 Gy\/three weeks to the breast, the axillary, subclavicular and internal mammary nodes, with two daily sessions of 1.5 Gy separated by an interval of eight hours; the second series consisted of a boost (21 Gy\/14 fractions\/10 d) alternating with another regimen of anthracycline-based-chemotherapy (a total of five cycles every three weeks). Hormonal treatment was given to all patients. Of the 53 patients evaluated at the end of the treatment, 44 (83%) had a complete clinical response, seven (13%) had a partial response (&gt; 50%) and two (4%) had tumoral progression. Of the 51 patients who were locally controlled, 18 (35%) presented a locoregional recurrence (LRR); eight (15%) had to undergo a mastectomy. All the patients but two with LRR developed metastases or died of local progressive disease and 26 (50%) developed metastases. With a median follow-up of 39 months (range: 4-74 months), survival rates at three and five years were respectively, 66 and 45% for overall survival and 45 and 36% for disease-free survival. Alternating a combination of chemotherapy and hyperfractionated accelerated radiotherapy is a well-tolerated regimen which provides acceptable local control. The systemic dissemination remains the major problem of inflammatory breast carcinoma and further clinical trials using alternative drug regimens are warranted. ","2276":"Radical prostatectomy remains the 'golden standard' therapy for localized prostate carcinoma for patients with a survival rate of more than ten years. However, because of the complications inherent in this surgical procedure, prostatectomy is presently increasingly challenged by various radiotherapy procedures. In the last decade, more sophisticated conformal therapy techniques have been proposed for prostate cancer patients. In parallel, for highly selected patients, brachytherapy is being promoted by an increasing number of medical centers. In fact, brachytherapy techniques for prostate cancers can be traced back to 1911, but recently developed techniques offer reliability and reproducibility, with satisfactory results in terms of tumor control and reduced toxicity, in selected patients. We present here the different techniques that are available today in prostate cancer brachytherapy.","2277":"Conservative surgical treatment has replaced mastectomy in the treatment of many breast cancers in the first clinical stages. This treatment introduces the risk of local recurrences which should always be prevented by radiotherapy. A better local control after conservative treatment or mastectomy might increase the cure rate. However, this is still open to controversy. In the case of more locally advanced tumors, a neoadjuvant chemotherapy decreases the risks of local recurrences but does not improve survival. The benefit of medical adjuvant treatment presented up to 10 and 15 years in the meta-analysis are reserved. The nature of the benefit, short delay in additional survival or cure of some patients is discussed. The effects of chemotherapy are most likely partly secondary to an action on the ovaries since the results are much more apparent in premenopausal patients. Comparative trials with new chemical or biological agents are still necessary. Up to now the benefit brought by the mammographic screening seems to be more important than the therapeutic progress itself.","2278":"","2279":"The \"Standards, Options and Recommendations\" (SOR), initiated in 1993, is a collaborative project between the Federation of the French Cancer Centres (FNCLCC), the 20 French Cancer Centres and specialists from French Public Universities, General Hospitals and Private Clinics. The main objective is the development of clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of health care and outcome for cancer patients. The methodology is based on literature review and critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary expert group, with feedback from specialists in cancer care delivery. To develop clinical practice guidelines for the diagnosis, management and treatment of patients with renal cancer. This review is part of previously published complete guidelines and focuses on the place of radiotherapy in this disease. The data was identified by literature search using Medline (up to June 1999) and personal reference lists. The main endpoints considered were survival, risk factors for late effects of radiotherapy, safety and quality of life. The key recommendations are: 1) In localised renal cancer, adjuvant radiotherapy has a limited role: it is not indicated for T1 and T2 tumours and there is no proof of a survival benefit for T3 N1-N2 tumours. Postoperative radiotherapy can be considered in young patients without risk factors for the development of post-radiotherapy complications and without loco-regional invasion (renal capsule, renal pelvis, vena cava, regional lymph nodes); 2) For metastatic tumours, the multidisciplinary team must decide whether palliative radiotherapy is appropriate after consideration of the prognostic factors. An isolated metastasis can be treated by radiosurgery and stereotaxic radiosurgery may be of benefit in the case of one or two cerebral metastasis. The optimal dose for palliative treatment is not known. Radiotherapy followed by immunotherapy can also be considered if the patient has no contraindication to such treatments. ","2280":"Recent data have shown that the in vitro and in vivo cytotoxicity of bioreductive drugs could be significantly increased by combination with ionising radiation or chemotherapy. Various parameters such as oxygen tension and timing of administration of the drugs could play a crucial role in the efficacy of combined treatment modalities. The aim of this study was to define the oxygen dependency of cell survival after in vitro irradiation and incubation with tirapazamine, a bioreductive drug, and cisplatin given alone or simultaneously. Two human cell lines were studied: one cell line sensitive to tirapazamine, Na11+, a pigmented melanoma with a high percentage of hypoxic cells, and a less sensitive cell line to tirapazamine, HRT18, a rectal adenocarcinoma. Gas changes were made to study cell survival at four different oxygen concentrations (pO2): air (20.9% O2), 10.2 and 0.2% O2. Cells were incubated with tirapazamine and cisplatin alone or combined for one hour at 37 degrees C, then irradiated and cultured. For Na11+, cell survival after irradiation was comparable in air and at 10% oxygen with the two drugs given alone or combined. At 2 and 0.2% oxygen, cell killing was largely increased by tirapazamine and was not modified by the addition of cisplatin. For HRT18, cell survival was not modified when cisplatin was added to radiation, whatever the oxygen partial pressure. At low pO2 (2 and 0.2%) the cytotoxic effect of tirapazamine was not significantly decreased by the addition of cisplatin. When cytotoxic and bioreductive drugs are combined to radiation, the magnitude of the observed effect is highly dependent on the partial oxygen pressure and on the sensitivity of the cell line to the individual drugs. This has very important implications for clinical strategies based on combined chemo-radiotherapy.","2281":"The aim of three-dimensional conformal therapy (3DCRT) is to treat the Planning Target Volume (PTV) to the prescribed dose while reducing doses to normal tissues and critical structures, in order to increase local control and reduce toxicity. The evaluation tools used for optimizing treatment techniques are three-dimensional visualization of dose distributions, dose-volume histograms, tumor control probabilities (TCP) and normal tissue complication probabilities (NTCP). These tools, however, do not fully quantify the conformity of dose distributions to the PTV. Specific tools were introduced to measure this conformity for a given dose level. We have extended those definitions to different dose levels, using a conformity index (CI). CI is based on the relative volumes of PTV and outside the PTV receiving more than a given dose. This parameter has been evaluated by a clinical study including 82 patients treated for lung cancer and 82 patients treated for prostate cancer. The CI was low for lung dosimetric studies (0.35 at the prescribed dose 66 Gy) due to build-up around the GTV and to spinal cord sparing. For prostate dosimetric studies, the CI was higher (0.57 at the prescribed dose 70 Gy). The CI has been used to compare treatment plans for lung 3DCRT (2 vs 3 beams) and prostate 3DCRT (4 vs 7 beams). The variation of CI with dose can be used to optimize dose prescription.","2282":"To define the therapeutic effect of Ginkgo biloba extract (EGb 761) in an experimental model of acute encephalopathy following total body irradiation in rats. Ninety four-month-old rats received 4.5 Gy total body irradiation (TBI) at day 1 while 15 rats received sham irradiation. A behavioural study based on a conditioning test of negative reinforcement, the one-way avoidance test, was performed test, was performed after irradiation. Orally treatment was started one day (study A) or twenty two days (study B) after irradiation and repeated daily for twelve days. In the irradiated group, three subgroups were defined according to the treatment received: EGb 761 (50 mg\/kg), EGb 761 (100 mg\/kg), water. This work comprised two consecutive studies. In study A (45 rats) the one-way avoidance test was administered daily from day 7 to day 14. In study B (45 rats) the behavioural test was performed from day 28 to day 35. Study A (three groups of 15 rats): following TBI, irradiated rats treated with water demonstrated a significant delay in a learning the one-way avoidance test in comparison with sham-irradiated rats (P &lt; 0.0002) or irradiated rats treated with EGb 761 (50 mg\/kg; P &lt; 0.0017) or EGb 761 (100 mg\/kg; P &lt; 0.0002). The irradiated rats, treated with EGb 761 (50 or 100 mg\/kg) did not differ from the sham-irradiated controls. Study B (three groups of 15 rats): the irradiated rats, treated with water or EGb 761 (50 or 100 mg\/kg) did not differ from the sham-irradiated controls. This study indicates that a relatively low dose of total body irradiation induces a substantial acute learning dysfunction in the rat, which persists fourteen days after TBI. This effect is prevented by the administration of EGb 761 (50 or 100 mg\/kg) started twenty-four hours after irradiation. ","2283":"New endobronchial techniques of treatment allow a good unblocking. Nevertheless, only high dose rate brachytherapy delivers a curative treatment for invasive carcinomas. This study analyses the results of the first 33 consecutive patients treated with curative intent by this technique from 1994 to 1997, and followed-up more than one year. Thirty-seven lesions were treated, with usual schedule delivering 30 Gy at 1 cm depth in six fractions and three to five weeks. All the patients were meticulously selected on the local involvement of the tumour and absolute contraindications to a surgical treatment. All of them have a pulmonary disease history or a general contraindication. With a 14-month follow-up, the local control at two months after the treatment was 95% (endoscopic and histologic), and 90% of the patients presented a prolonged local control. Four patients died of the treated cancer, another of a controlateral cancer. Ten patients died of another disease, five of them from a respiratory insufficiency. The overall survival rate at two years was 53% and the specific survival rate 80%. The acute tolerance was good, without incident. Asymptomatic bronchial stenoses, described by endoscopic follow-up, were described for seven patients. We conclude that, on the basis of a good selection of the patients and a respect of the indications, high dose rate endobronchial brachytherapy is an effective curative treatment. It offers a new curative option and must be proposed for the small invasive carcinomas in non-operable patients. ","2284":"Prognostic factors in the treatment of local advanced hepatocellular carcinoma with radiotherapy, transcatheter arterial embolization and arterial infusion. The treatment effects of radiotherapy and combination modality therapy for the local advanced hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) were retrospectively reviewed. Three hundred and fifty-six patients of HCC (187 recurrent cases after surgical resection) were treated by 1) radiotherapy only; 2) Bi-therapeutic method: hepatic artery ligation (HAL) and\/or hepatic artery embolization (HAE) plus radiotherapy; and 3) tri-therapeutic method (bi-therapeutic method plus hepatic artery infusion) from 1975 to 1996. Kaplan-Meier method has been used to evaluate the survival rates. There were no significant differences among these three treatment groups in the symptom relief rate, but the mean relief time period was much shorter in radiotherapy alone group (2.5 vs 44 months, P &lt; 0.05). A lower tumor response rate was found in the radiotherapy alone group (P &lt; 0.05), although that was similar for both primary or recurrent tumors (P &gt; 0.05). There were evident differences in five-year survivals among these three treatment groups: 0% for radiotherapy alone, 22.8% for bi-therapeutic method and 38.8% for tri-therapeutic method (P &lt; 0.01). The prognosis was influenced by Okuda classification. Non-resectable local advanced HCC can be treated by the combination modality therapy, including radiotherapy, with a quite high cure rate. Radiotherapy alone can relief the symptoms. ","2285":"If low LET radiation therapy (photons, electrons), following radical microscopically and complete surgery can improve results in term of local control from 34 to 74% for salivary gland tumors, local control is more difficult to achieve in advanced tumors and only palliative treatment is usually attempted. In this survey, all the patient series treated worldwide were reviewed. They show an overall control rate of 31% with photon vs 64% with neutron therapy. A prospective randomised trial sponsored by the RTOG and the MRC published in 1988 and reviewed in 1993 showed an overall locoregional complete tumor clearance of 67% for neutrons and 17% for photons (P &lt; 0.005), with 68% and 25% survival at two years for neutrons and photons respectively. This study was closed for ethical reasons. In Orleans, since 1987, 59 patients have been treated. At five years the persistent local control probability was 69.5%, the five-year crude survival probability 66% and the five-year tumor free survival probability was 64.5%. This review provides evidence that surgical treatment for salivary gland tumors should be limited to patients presenting a high likelihood of negative surgical margin and a small risk of facial nerve damage. Others patients should receive neutron radiation therapy alone as definitive treatment.","2286":"Several recent studies suggest that gene transfer can be combined with irradiation to increase anti-tumor efficacy. Among genes of particular interest to be used in this combined approach are those involved in the regulation of radiation-induced lethality (apoptosis, DNA repair). Some additional aspects appear to be relatively specific to these combinations, such as the type of vector to be used (anaerobic bacteria) or the type of promoter (radio-inducible promoters). The first results obtained in mice bearing human xenograft tumors, combining gene transfer and irradiation, are encouraging, but no clinical study has been performed so far. Finally it should be pointed out, in this area as well as in cancer gene therapy in general, that progress in gene vectorisation is mandatory to optimize gene distribution within the tumor.","2287":"According to the reports described in the literature, fractionated HDR brachytherapy seems to represent one option for the primary treatment of cervical carcinoma. In order to render such treatment transparent and comparable for those interested in the field, we have attempted to report our recent experience obtained in Vienna from 1993-1997 using the terminology proposed by the ICRU report 38, focusing in particular on dose and volume reporting and a linear-quadratic model. Based on these parameters, a comparison with the preceding period in Vienna (LDR\/HDR) has been made, with an attempt to correlate different methods and parameters with outcome. One hundred and eighty-nine patients (mean age 67 years) were treated with curative intent (stage Ia: 2, Ib: 11, IIa: 11, IIb: 79, IIIa: 19, IIIb: 59, IVa: 5, IVb: 3 patients) using a combination of intracervical high-dose rate (HDR) brachytherapy (ring-tandem applicator) and a box technique for external-beam therapy (EBT: 48.6-50 Gy, linac 25 MV). Small tumors were treated with 5-6 fractions of 7 Gy at point A and 50 Gy EBT (25 Gy in the brachytherapy reference volume) which is isoeffective to 76-86 Gy at point A. Large tumors received 3-4 fractions of 7 Gy after 50 Gy EBT with open fields, which is isoeffective to 82-92 Gy at point A. TRAK varied from mean 1.4 cGy (3 fractions) to 2.8 cGy (6 fractions) at one meter. 3-D treatment planning for brachytherapy was based on conventional X-rays and in 181\/189 patients on computed tomography (CT) with the applicator in place. Computer-calculated volumes of the brachytherapy reference isodose (7 Gy\/fraction) ranged from 46-155 ccm (mean 87 ccm); the respective mean hwt-volume (height x width x thickness) was 180 ccm. The 60 Gy HWT volumes (25 Gy from EBT) for the irradiation of small tumors ranged from 240 to 407 ccm (mean 337 ccm) and for larger tumors (50 Gy for EBT) from 452 to 785 ccm (mean 607 ccm). The mean dose for brachytherapy was 16.2 Gy (6.2-37.8 Gy) at the ICRU rectum reference point and 14.4 Gy (4.6-35.7 Gy) at the ICRU bladder point. Taking into account the dose for EBT, the mean isoeffective dose at the ICRU rectum reference point was 69.9 Gy (28.4-98.7 Gy). Overall treatment time was six weeks for small tumors and eight weeks for large tumors. After a mean follow-up of 34 months, actuarial pelvic control and disease-specific survival rates at three years were 77.6\/68.6% for all patients, 100\/77.1% for stage Ib, 100\/100% stage IIa, 87.0\/78.0% stage IIb, 52.7\/52.1% stage IIIa, 69.1\/58.6% stage IIIb and 60\/53.3% stage IVa. According to the LENT\/SOMA score which had been prospectively introduced, the actuarial late complication rate for grades 3 and 4 was 2.9% for the bladder, 4.0% for the bowel, 6.1% for the rectum and 30.6% for the vagina (shortening and obliteration); in total for all grades 23.6, 18.4, 24.2, and 67.6%, respectively. In our experience, HDR brachytherapy combined with EBT is an efficient method if sufficient radiation doses and volumes are applied, both with regard to tumor control and adverse side effects. In future, the therapeutic window will be increased by systematic integration of magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) into treatment planning, thus allowing for a highly individualized approach with further adaptation of radiation dose and volume both to the target and to the individual topography of organs at risk. ","2288":"The prospective record of acute and late toxicity after treatment of cervix carcinomas is a part of the description of treatment outcome as well as local control and survival. Due to the large number of scales and glossaries used, the comparison of the results from one study to another is often difficult. The French-Italian syllabus seems to be the most reliable scale, providing implementation of quality of life assessments. The main predictive factor of complications, which is not related to the treatment type, is the previous history of abdominal or pelvic surgery. The incidence and severity of complications occurring after surgery are related to the surgical procedure and to the amount of peri-uterine tissues removed. The increase in dose and volume of external irradiation and brachytherapy and the increase in dose rate of the low-dose rate brachytherapy are responsible for the radiotherapeutic morbidity. The significant decrease of severe complication rates during the last 15 years was obtained by the implementation of individual adjustments in treatment planning. The treatment strategies of early bulky and advanced carcinomas are changing. Concurrent radiotherapy and chemotherapy is becoming a standard, but its late toxicity needs to be documented by a longer follow-up. The optimisation of radiation therapy should remain a reference to evaluate the outcome and morbidity of the new combined strategies: the addition of chemotherapy will never compensate for less than optimal radiotherapy\/brachytherapy planning.","2289":"Low-stage uterine cervix carcinoma can be treated by either surgery, radiation therapy or combined treatments with high cure rates ranging from 90 to 95% for stage IB1 tumors. However, the standard treatment, combining external beam plus intracavitary radiation, fails to control the progression of the disease in 35 to 90% of patients with locally advanced cervical cancer. No substantial improvements have been made in the treatment of these tumors in the past two decades. The addition of concurrent 5-FU in a phase III study failed to improve the results in the overall patient population, but the five-year DFS was significantly better in a subset of patients (tumor &gt; 5 cm and IB\/IIA or medial parametrial IIB disease). Concurrent chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin showed, in a phase III study, a significantly longer DFS in patients treated with chemotherapy despite the same long-term local tumor control. After many phase II studies, five phase III studies have recently demonstrated a 40 to 60% reduction in the relative risk of recurrence with cisplatin-containing chemoradiation. Across these studies, the risk of death was reduced by 30 to 50%. The benefit was less clear in patients with stages III-IV tumors than in patients with lower stages associated with poor prognostic factors. Haematologic and gastrointestinal toxicity of chemoradiation was greater than that of radiotherapy alone. However, late side effects were similar in the different treatment groups. These results must be confirmed with a longer follow-up. The importance of concurrent chemotherapy during the brachytherapy procedure should be analyzed. It has yet to be determined which chemotherapy regimen achieves the most favorable therapeutic ratio.","2290":"Brachytherapy is a fundamental step in the treatment of patients with cervical cancer. Brachytherapy allows a significant increase in the local control rate as well as the survival rate. Brachytherapy has to be performed as soon as possible after external irradiation in order to maintain the overall treatment time below 53 days. Technical and dosimetric data characterizing low dose-rate brachytherapy using ICRU 38 recommendations have led to an improvement in local control and a decrease in complications. Data are less well known for other dose rates. The role of interstitial brachytherapy is not clearly defined and its potential benefit is probably balanced by an increase in severe complications. Concomitant brachy-chemotherapy requires further clinical investigations, even if concomitant radio-chemotherapy has become a standard in advanced cervical cancers.","2291":"External irradiation and brachytherapy are curative in the treatment of carcinoma of the cervix. The aim of radiotherapy is to optimize the irradiation of the target volume and to reduce the dose to critical organs. The use of imaging (computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging added to clinical findings and standard guidelines) are studied in the treatment planning of external irradiation and brachytherapy in carcinoma of the cervix. Imaging allows an individualized and conformal treatment planning.","2292":"The radical hysterectomy by laparotomy with resection of the proximal and distal parts of the parametria (type III according to the Piver's classification) is the most appropriate treatment of stage Ib and II cervical carcinoma. Nevertheless, a resection of a partial part of the parametria and conservative surgery (of the uterus and\/or ovaries) are possible in selected cases of patients with good prognostic factors. The lymphadenectomy has a diagnostic, prognostic but probably also a therapeutic value. Para-aortic lymphadenectomy should be performed in patients with a bulky tumor. Pelvic exenteration with reconstructive surgery could be discussed in young patients with centro-pelvic recurrence of a cervical carcinoma.","2293":"At the turn of this century, the evidence of the benefits of a concurrent chemo-radiotherapy in locally advanced tumors and the development of mini-invasive surgery (laparoscopic and radical vaginal surgery) are the two main advances in the management of cervical carcinomas. From a personal experience of 304 cervical carcinomas, the different techniques of laparoscopy used in cervical carcinomas are addressed and discussed. Their long-term results when involved in the management protocols of cervical carcinomas at different stages are reported. From this series, some conclusions are drawn: 1) laparoscopy can spare a laparotomy in early-stage node-negative patients with low tumoral volume; 2) it can spare a systematic extended-field radiation therapy in high-risk patients with node-negative para-aortic exploration; 3) it can spare surgery in patients with a centro-pelvic advanced stage or recurrence, possibly candidates for an exenterative procedure, if occult spread is found in the intra- or retroperitoneal areas. The more and more frequent combination of the mini-invasive surgery for staging and treatment and radiotherapy or chemotherapy explains the need for new protocols of a more and more complex and specialized management.","2294":"Imaging of uterine cervix carcinoma has evolved during the last decade. Recent developments in magnetic resonance imaging have expanded the role of MRI in evaluating the pathology of uterine cervix carcinoma. MRI is now the modality of choice for tumor staging, evaluating tumor response to treatment, diagnosing recurrences and for evaluating pregnant patients. MRI images will soon be used to calculate dosimetry for brachytherapy with matching and fusion software.","2295":"","2296":"","2297":"","2298":"The \"Standards, Options and Recommendations\" (SOR) project, started in 1993, is a collaboration between the National Federation of the French Cancer Centres (FNCLCC), the 20 French Cancer Centres (CRLCC) and specialists from French public universities, general hospitals and private clinics. The main objective is the development of clinical practice guidelines to improve the quality of health care and outcome for cancer patients. The methodology is based on literature review and critical appraisal by a multidisciplinary group of experts, with feedback from specialists in cancer care delivery. To update, according to the methodology of SOR, the Standards, Options and Recommendations for the management of patients with cancer of the cervix, and in particular, the place of concomitant radiochemotherapy. Data have been identified by a literature search using Medline (to April 1999) and the personal reference lists of experts. Once the guidelines were defined, the document was submitted for review to independent national and international reviewers and to the medical committees of the CRCC. The principle recommendations concerning the place of radiochemotherapy in the treatment of cancer of the cervix are 1\/ the available data shows a significant increase in local control (level of evidence A) and of overall survival (level of evidence B1) following concomitant radiochemotherapy as compared to radiotherapy alone or the combination of radiotherapy-hydroxyurea. For stages IB, IIA, proximal IIB with bad prognostic factors (tumour size greater than 4 cm and\/or invasion of pelvic nodes and\/or microscopic invasion of the parametrium) and without lumbo-aortic nodal invasion, concomitant radiochemotherapy can be considered as standard treatment. This benefit is less clear for stages distal IIB, III and IVA without para-aortic nodal invasion (level of evidence C) and must be confirmed (expert agreement). 2\/ the toxicity of radiochemotherapy is essentially haematologic and gastrointestinal (level of evidence B1) and is greater than that of radiotherapy alone (level of evidence B1). 3\/ these results have been obtained by the combination of chemotherapy based oncisplatin alone, or in combination with 5-FU. Although of equal benefit, the toxicity of the cisplatin\/5-FU\/ hydroxyurea combination was greater than that of cisplatin alone in a trial comparing the two protocols. A significantly longer survival have also been obtained by the combination of chemoradiation and adjuvant chemotherapy with epirubicin (level of evidence C). These results must be confirmed. 4\/ the exact means of delivering the chemotherapy has not been clearly established. In fact, in these trials, some protocols use cisplatin weekly at a dose of 40 mg\/m2 and others every three or four weeks at doses ranging from 50 to 75 mg\/m2. Subsequent randomised studies are likely to establish optimal schema for the delivery of chemotherapy when combined with external radiotherapy and brachytherapy. ","2299":null,"2300":"To describe the evolution of the use of the electronic portal imaging device (EPID) over three periods. From 1990, as part of the quality assurance research programs, the radiotherapy department of the G.-F. Leclerc Centre of Dijon used EPID systems in a prospective fashion. During the first of the three periods (PER 1:1990-1993), the study consisted of analysis criteria determination, software efficiency improvement and a selection of patients who could benefit from the method. Eight hundred and forty-five images of 40 patients were analysed qualitatively and quantitatively. Two verifications per week were planned, and the action level for correction was 10 mm. Head and neck images were also displayed in 'cinema' presentation for internal movements analysis. From 1994 to 1995 (PER 2), off-line procedure (OLP) based upon early correction of the systematic error and the rules calculated from our previous experience were tested for checking the brain, head and neck (LOC 1: 396 images) and many of the pelvic irradiations (LOC 2: 260 images). A double-exposure procedure and\/or movie loop presentation was reserved for other patients. During the last period (PER 3: 1996-1997), the OLP procedure was routinely performed in 54 patients (images: 321 LOC 1, 680 LOC 2). LOC 1: deviations of &lt; 3 mm increased from 75.5% during PER 1 to 81% during PER 2 to 83% during PER3. Conversely, deviations of 3-5 mm dropped from 19.5 to 13%, while deviations of more than 5 mm remained stable, around 5%. The actual standard error of the mean deviation observed was 2 mm. LOC 2: deviations of &lt; 5 mm were observed in 81% of the cases during PER 1 and in 91% during PER 3 (89.5% in PER 2). These good results led to a decrease in deviation of 5 to 7 mm (11 to 6%) and also to a significant drop in deviations of more than 7 mm, 8 to 3% respectively. The actual precision obtained was 2.5 mm +\/- 3 mm SD. The OLP based upon the early correction of the systematic error led to a significant increase of setup accuracy of patients irradiated for the brain, head and neck, and especially for pelvic lesions. ","2301":"To analyse retrospectively the results of different treatment regimens of carcinomas of the floor of the mouth and tongue. Between 1982 and 1992, 61 patients with carcinoma of the floor of the mouth and 30 with tongue cancer (25 stage I, nine stage II, 28 stage III, 29 stage IV) were treated in the radiotherapy department of Poitiers. Nine patients with stage I tumours were treated with 70 Gy low-dose rate brachytherapy only, without nodal dissection. Stages II and III were treated with combined surgery with neck dissection; and radiotherapy of stage II with nodal metastasis and for all stage III cases. Stage IV cases were treated either surgically if possible, or with combined chemotherapy and radiation. The five-year overall survival rate was 87.3% for stage I, 68.5% for stage II, 45.3% for stage III, and 0% for stage IV patients. Most relapses appeared in the first two years after treatment. Eight patients (32%) with stage I cancer developed nodal relapses, isolated in five cases. Complications of radiotherapy were acceptable. Four cases of osteonecrosis were observed after radiotherapy. All of these appeared simultaneously with a local relapse. These results are comparable with reports in the literature. The remarkable observation of our study is the high incidence of nodal recurrences after local treatment of stage I tumours. Therefore, local treatment is insufficient for early-stage tumours. The question of neck dissection for the early stage is discussed. ","2302":"Germ cell tumors of the testes are rare tumors occurring in young men, the incidence of which increases continuously. They are curable in more than 80% of the cases. The treatment of stage I seminoma is lomboaortic radiotherapy, and that of stage I non-seminomatous tumors is either surveillance, retroperitoneal lymph node dissection or adjuvant chemotherapy according to the risk factors of extra-testicular involvement (pure embryonal carcinoma, vascular invasion). For advanced diseases, the standard treatment is three cycles of bleomycin, etoposide, cisplatin (BEP regimen) or four cycles of the same association without bleomycin (EP regimen) and four cycles of the BEP regimen for patients with good risk and poor risk prognostic characteristics, respectively. The five-year overall survival rates are 90% and 50% for patients with good risk and poor risk factors respectively. It is recommended to resect all residual masses after chemotherapy. The standard salvage treatment is four cycles of vinblastin, ifosfamide, cisplatin (VelP regimen). New associations of drugs are under study in order to improve the overall survival rate for the poor-risk and relapsed-tumors patients.","2303":"Postoperative radiotherapy is controversial after radical mastectomy. Recent clinical trials have shown an increase in survival with this irradiation and conclusions of previous meta-analyses should be reconsidered. The results of a large number of randomized clinical trials in which women received post-mastectomy radiotherapy or not have been reviewed. These trials showed a decrease in locoregional failure with the use of postoperative radiotherapy but survival advantages have not been clearly identified. A larger number of randomized clinical trials compared postoperative radiotherapy alone, chemotherapy alone and the association of the two treatments. They showed that chemotherapy was less active locally than radiotherapy and that radiotherapy and chemotherapy significantly increased both disease-free and overall survival rates in the groups which received postoperative radiotherapy. These favourable results were, however, obtained with optimal radiotherapy techniques and a relative sparing of lung tissue and cardiac muscle. Many retrospective clinical analyses concluded that results obtained in locoregional failure rate were poor and that these failures led to an increase in future risks. Both radiotherapy and systemic treatment should be delivered after mastectomy, reserved for patients with a high risk of locoregional relapses, particularly of nodes and\/or tumors with a diameter &gt; or = 5 cm. However, radiotherapy could produce secondary effects, and techniques of radiotherapy should be optimal.","2304":"","2305":"","2306":"","2307":"","2308":"Following a pneumonectomy for cancer, the patients are classically observed by clinical examination and standard chest X-ray. However, torpid empyemas can be missed when they occur after the period of hospitalization and when they are not accompanied by a fever. At the time of postoperative radiotherapy, the dosimetric CT scan constitutes the first examination providing objective information of the endothoracic content. It is therefore necessary on this occasion to assure the normality of the postpneumonectomy pleural space while checking that the substituted liquid is homogeneous and above all that the internal mediastinal part of the cavity has a concave appearance. If that is not the case, an empyema should be suspected. The diagnosis, confirmed by a cytobacteriological examination of the pleural fluid, constitutes a counterindication of the radiotherapy. We present two cases of postpneumonectomy paucisymptomatic empyema which were diagnosed during the course of postoperative radiotherapy when the initial dosimetric CT scan was pathologic and could have allowed an earlier diagnosis.","2309":"We report the case of a six-week-old baby who underwent irradiation for a giant hepatic hemangioma. After medical treatment including corticosteroids and interferon, no response was observed. She progressed to respiratory failure, requiring the use of mechanical ventilation. An emergency radiation therapy of the liver was decided. We observed a rapid improvement of the child, with the recovery of autonomous breathing without mechanical ventilation and a normalization of cardiac functions. Two months later, a partial left hepatic embolization was needed due to a progression of a localized blood flow. Six months later, she finally came back home. Cardiac output was normal and hepatomegaly began to regress. One year later, ponderal status is satisfactory, and it remains a localized hepatic right lobe hypertrophy without functional consequence.","2310":"The definition of criteria and of a methodology dedicated to the quantitative evaluation of conformal stereotactic treatment plans is presented. We implemented the 'Receiver Operating Characteristics' (ROC) analysis, already used in medical imaging, for the quantitative evaluation of irradiation treatment plans. This implementation is based on data provided by dose-volume histograms (DVH). Three techniques, each one using a different dosimetric criterion, were defined for the choice of a reference isodose for a given treatment plan. We used this ROC analysis for the selection of the most conformal treatment plan and its reference isodose among the treatment plans proposed for one patient. This study revealed the interest of ROC analysis based on dose-volume histograms for the quantitative evaluation of treatment plans.","2311":"The most commonly used imaging modality for the diagnosis and localization of arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) treated with stereotactic radiotherapy is traditional angiography, but it would be desirable to also use digital subtraction angiography (DSA). However, DSA images are distorted due to the electron-optical characteristics of the X-ray image intensifier. For that reason, we have developed a method for the correction of the image distortion. The ISIS II Treatment Planning System (ISIS II TPS), developed at the Curie Institute, has been used for image acquisition and stereotactic localization. A grid phantom has been constructed for determining the distortion of the DSA images. The software developed for the correction has been implemented into the TPS and is based on a correction vector produced by matching the distorted and corrected grid points. The method has been tested for its ability to correct the position of all grid points as well as its effectiveness in real cases as compared to traditional angiography. The maximum displacement of the corrected grid points compared with their original position is measured to be 0.1 mm. The accuracy of the target localization using the corrected DSA images is comparable with traditional angiography localization and falls inside acceptable accuracy limits. In conclusion, this method offers the possibility of using DSA images for stereotactic localization without limiting the requested accuracy.","2312":null,"2313":"To report the results of a prospective randomized study concerning the role of radiotherapy in the treatment of stage III, unresectable, asymptomatic non-small cell lung cancer. Between 1992 and 1996, 240 patients with stage III, unresectable, asymptomatic non-small cell lung cancer were enrolled in this study, and sequentially randomized to one of the three treatment arms: conventional irradiation, hypofractionated irradiation and control group. In the conventional irradiation arm (79 patients), a dose of 50 Gy in 25 fractions in five weeks was delivered to the primary tumor and the mediastinum. In the hypofractionated irradiation arm (81 patients), there were two courses of irradiation separated by an interval of four weeks. In each series, patients received 20 Gy in five fractions in five days, in the same treatment volume as the conventional irradiation group. In the control group arm, 80 patients initially did not receive radiotherapy and were only observed. Delayed palliative hypofractionated irradiation (20-25 Gy in four to five fractions in four to five days) was given to the primary tumor when major symptoms developed. The two-year actuarial survival rates for patients in the conventional irradiation, hypofractionated irradiation and control group arms were 18%, 6% and 0%, with a median survival time of 12 months, nine months and six months respectively. The differences between survival rates were statistically significant at the 0.05 level. Although irradiation provides good palliation, the results are disappointing. The comparison of conventional and hypofractionated irradiation shows an advantage for conventional schedules. ","2314":"To analyse retrospectively the local control, overall survival and immediate and long-term tolerance after a radiotherapy delivered with a curative intent systematically including a high-dose rate brachytherapy. From January 1993 to January 1995, 50 patients (45 males-five females, median age: 61) with non-small cell lung cancers, inoperable for tumour reasons, non-metastatic, were included in the protocol. Following external radiotherapy (55-65 Gy conventional fractionation), all the patients received high-dose rate brachytherapy delivering 14 to 24 Gy using fractions of 7 Gy. Immediate tolerance was good. Two months after the end of the treatment, five patients suffered from massive haemorrhages and three others experienced a mucosal necrosis (two tracheal sites). Tumour response was observed endoscopically in 88% of the cases (38\/50) and was complete in 38%. Median survival of complete responders was 15 months. In the mean follow-up period of 24 months, five patients were still alive with no evidence of disease (median survival: 30 months). Most of the patients died from distant metastases (33\/50: 66%). Systematic use of endoluminal high-dose rate brachytherapy in addition to external radiotherapy did not improve survival. The gain in the local control rate was counteracted by an increase in haemorrhages and mucosal necroses. Improving techniques and dosimetry, and combining different methods which have proved their efficiency, should result in improvements in survival. Quality of life would be part of the analysed parameters in any future study. ","2315":"A retrospective analysis of conservative treatment of anal canal cancers with external radiation therapy and interstitial brachytherapy with or without chemotherapy. From 1986 to 1996, 69 patients were treated with external radiotherapy (40 Gy\/20 fractions) and interstitial brachytherapy (20 Gy) after a mean interval of six weeks for a localized epidermoid carcinoma of the anal canal. Patients who did not complete the whole therapeutic sequence were not included. Forty-five patients received additional 5-fluorouracil- and\/or mitomycin C-based chemotherapy regimen. Acute toxicity was acceptable. Complete response rate was 81%. Actuarial local control rate was at two and five years, 65% and 59% respectively (median follow-up: eight years). At two, five and ten years, actuarial colostomy rate was 26%, 33% and 33% respectively, and colostomy-free survival rates 61%, 47% and 37%. Overall survival at two, five and ten years was 81%, 65% and 53% respectively. Distant metastases occurred in 11 patients (16%). Prognostic factors for overall survival were performance status (PS) (79% survival at five years for patients with PS 0 versus 50% for patients with PS 1-3, P = 0.04) and tumor stage (80% at five years for T1-T2 versus 53% for T3-T4, P = 0.03). Overall treatment time less than 12 weeks and time interval between external radiotherapy and brachytherapy inferior than six weeks were associated with a better local control (P = 0.05). In multivariate analysis, these prognostic factors were not significant. These results confirm the efficacy of external radiotherapy and brachytherapy in the treatment of small anal canal cancers, and point out the need for improving treatment outcome of larger tumors. ","2316":"We initiated at Hospital de Mulhouse a prospective phase II study to assess a split-course concurrent radiochemotherapy in locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer. From March 1996 to December 1997, 28 patients were included in our study. All patients had a stage III cancer. The chemotherapy scheduled included vinorelbine (20 mg\/m2\/d, d1 and d5), cisplatin (20 mg\/m2\/d, from d1 to d5), and 5-Fluorouracil (350 mg\/m2\/d, from d1 to d5 by continuous infusion). The planned irradiation dose was 12.5 Gy per week with one daily fraction of 2.5 Gy from d1 to d5. Cycles were repeated every four weeks, for four cycles (50 Gy). Patients with a partial or complete response were proposed a fifth cycle. Of the 28 patients of the study, only 27 were analysed; one patient had a metastatic disease at diagnosis. Major hematologic toxicity occurred in 26% of the patients. One to five cycles of chemoradiotherapy were administrated per patient (median: four). Four patients had received fewer than three cycles and their responses were not assessable. Of the 23 patients assessed, 12 responses (52%) were observed, three CR (13%) and nine PR (39%). Median follow-up was 14 months, and median survival 13.5 months. One- and two-year survival rates were respectively 63% and 14%. Local control rates was 11%, and 44% of the patients had a metastatic evolution. Very preliminary results of this phase II study are disappointing, and quite inferior to the published results using chemoradiotherapy with conventional or hyperfractionated radiotherapy. Hematologic toxicity is restrictive. This type of chemoradiotherapy cannot be recommended. ","2317":"","2318":"The significantly higher human and material costs induced by the development of conformal radiotherapy cannot be ignored. In France, the present criteria for medical reimbursements underestimate the costs related to treatment preparation and evaluation, slowing down the implementation of new equipment and therapeutic practices. To fit the legitimate concerns regarding health cost containment, conformal radiotherapy should be submitted to appropriate economic analyses. These analyses are based on rigorous methods aimed at weighing the actual costs of conformal treatment by the benefits achieved in terms of tumor control, normal tissue complication and the patients' quality of life. The conclusions from the few studies published to date are rather in favour of conformal radiotherapy when compared to alternative therapeutic procedures. These early results need to be confirmed in order to support more rational reimbursement modalities to promote innovative treatments.","2319":"About one third of lung cancers initially present with a localised disease, without any curative surgery potential, because of local spread or comorbidity. Definitive radiation, alone or combined with chemotherapy, then represents the treatment of choice for these patients. The results, however, are disappointing, with a biopsy-proven local control of 10% at two years and a 5-10% five-year survival rate. These poor results may be partially explained by the difficulties in delineating the tumour volume as well as the dose limitations due to poor tolerance of surrounding normal organs. Lung parenchyma sequelae remain daily worrying events for the oncologist. The advent of 3D conformal radiation therapy (3DRT) allows progress and innovations, including the use of modern imaging techniques, sophisticated dosimetry and treatment planning, efficient immobilisation devices and on-line verification procedures. With more precise (and time-consuming) procedures, 3DRT will allow a better tumour volume delineation, an increased tumour dose and a dose limitation in normal tissues. These improvements may help increase local control and survival results. 3DRT, which has been used for several years for prostate cancer and benefits from recent imaging improvements, will now allow treatment of other locations, such as lung cancer, with conformal therapy. The few preliminary results are encouraging. This work reviews the current data and remaining questions regarding lung cancer treated with 3DRT, and presents and discusses the literature before discussing future trends in this area.","2320":"The outcome of head and neck malignancies is closely related to the achievement of local tumor control. The occurrence of severe late complications is the consequence of the anatomic vicinity between dose-limiting normal tissues and the tumor, thus reducing the curative potential of radiotherapy. Conformal radiotherapy is presently actively investigated as a way to improve the dose distribution in head and neck malignancies (especially when originating from the nasopharynx or the sinuses) while protecting healthy organs. Such an approach requires a chain of sophisticated procedures, including efficient quality assurance programs, in order to achieve the proper degree of safety. The relatively limited clinical studies published to-date have already confirmed the advantage of conformal radiotherapy in terms of dose delivery. The development of beam intensity modulation is likely to further contribute to the improvement of the therapeutic ratio.","2321":"Conformal irradiation of brain tumours is based on the three-dimensional reconstruction of the targeted volumes and at-risk organ images, the three-dimensional calculation of the dose distribution and a treatment device (immobilisation, beam energy, collimation, etc.) adapted to the high precision required by the procedure. Each step requires an appropriate methodology and a quality insurance program. Specific difficulties in brain tumour management are related to GTV and CTV definition depending upon the histological type, the quality of the surgical resection and the medical team. Clinical studies have reported dose escalation trials, mostly in high-grade gliomas and tumours at the base of the skull. Clinical data are now providing a better knowledge of the tolerance of normal tissues. As for small tumours, the implementation of beam intensity modulation is likely to narrow the gap between conformal and stereotaxic radiotherapy.","2322":"Recent progress in radiotherapeutic management of localized prostate cancer is reviewed. Clinical aspects--including dose-effect beyond 70 Gy, relative role of conformal radiation therapy techniques and of early hormonal treatment--are discussed as well as technical components--including patient immobilization, organ motion, prostate contouring, beam arrangement, 3-D treatment planning and portal imaging. The local control and biological relapse-free survival rates appear to be improved by high dose conformal radiotherapy from 20 to 30% for patients with intermediate and high risk of relapse. A benefit of overall survival is expected but not yet demonstrated. Late reactions, especially the rectal toxicity, remain moderate despite the dose escalation. However, conformal radiotherapy demands a high precision at all steps of the procedure.","2323":"Since early 1997, dynamic multileaf collimators (DMLCs) have been used in our division for intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). We have used IMRT to: irradiate concave targets (head and neck, paraspinal tumors); combine beams with shallow hinge angles (mediastinum, lung tumors); deliver intentionally inhomogeneous dose distributions (prostate, paranasal sinuses, brain tumors). IMRT is now our standard treatment for locoregional relapse (after high-dose radiotherapy) for head and neck cancer and for radical treatment of localized prostate cancer. For a variety of other tumors, conventional 3D-plans are compared with IMRT-plans, the latter being clinically implemented if superior. We developed a geometry based IMRT planning strategy to create assemblies of static intensity modulated (IM)-beams which consist of uniform (unmodulated) segments. By a translator program, segments are combined in a single prescription which allows delivery under computer control. Cost-containment is further improved by automation of the planning. After manual or semi-automated contouring of PTV and the organs at risk, prostate IMRT plans, based on a class solution, are generated and optimized by a computer. IMRT for pharyngeal relapses and most other tumor sites is planned semi-automatically. IMRT replaces gradually conventional treatments in our division. Interesting dose distributions generated by IMRT allow a better sparing of normal tissues with decreased acute and late toxicity, and offer a window for further dose escalation.","2324":"'Conformal radiotherapy' is the name fixed by usage and given to a new form of radiotherapy resulting from the technological improvements observed during, the last ten years. While this terminology is now widely used, no precise definition can be found in the literature. Conformal radiotherapy refers to an approach in which the dose distribution is more closely 'conformed' or adapted to the actual shape of the target volume. However, the achievement of a consensus on a more specific definition is hampered by various difficulties, namely in characterizing the degree of 'conformality'. We have therefore suggested a classification scheme be established on the basis of the tools and the procedures actually used for all steps of the process, i.e., from prescription to treatment completion. Our classification consists of four levels: schematically, at level 0, there is no conformation (rectangular fields); at level 1, a simple conformation takes place, on the basis of conventional 2D imaging; at level 2, a 3D reconstruction of the structures is used for a more accurate conformation; and level 3 includes research and advanced dynamic techniques. We have used our personal experience, contacts with colleagues and data from the literature to analyze all the steps of the planning process, and to define the tools and procedures relevant to a given level. The corresponding tables have been discussed and approved at the European level within the Dynarad concerted action. It is proposed that the term 'conformal radiotherapy' be restricted to procedures where all steps are at least at level 2.","2325":"Most of the concepts and terms related to conformal radiotherapy were produced by English-speaking authors and eventually validated by international groups of experts, whose working language was also English. Therefore, a significant part of this literature is poorly accessible to the French-speaking radiation oncology community. The present paper gathers the 'official' definitions already published in French, along with propositions for the remaining terms which should be submitted to a more formal and representative validation process.","2326":"","2327":"","2328":"","2329":"","2330":"","2331":"","2332":"","2333":"Accuracy of conformal treatment planning for prostatic radiotherapy is based on the contours of target volumes (prostate +\/- seminal vesicles) and normal tissues (rectum and bladder), drawn on CT (computed tomography) images by radiation oncologists. The interpretation of a given CT image can be different from one radiation oncologist to another, and may change in time with the state of filling of the bladder and of the rectum during the treatment. In order to quantify these variations, 12 patients treated with conformal radiotherapy for prostate carcinoma (pelvis 40 Gy\/20 sessions + prostate 30 Gy\/15 sessions) had two series of CT at one month intervals. Contouring of prostate, rectum and bladder were performed independently on each CT by two radiation oncologists. The first CT scan (planning CT) and the first series of contours (planning contours) were used for treatment planning. The contours of the second scan were compared to the planning contours after image fusion based on manual superimposition of bony anatomy of the two sets of CT images. Coherence ratio were defined to measure discrepancies in prostate volumes between radiation oncologists (RCE) and between scans (RCT). The mean RCE was 38 +\/- 7% (1 standard deviation). Those discrepancies were primarily located at the prostate apex and at the interface between bladder and prostate and between rectum and prostate. The mean RCT was 42 +\/- 8% (1 sigma). Those discrepancies were due to the prostate motion related to the state of filling of the rectum and bladder. For bladder and rectal walls, less important differences were observed between the two radiation oncologists for the same CT (4.5% for rectal volume receiving 65 Gy or more, 3% for bladder volume receiving 65 Gy or more). However, important differences in bladder and rectal volumes receiving 65 Gy or more (16% and 7% respectively) were noted for the same patient from a CT to another due to the variation in bladder or rectal filling. New techniques for planning CT acquisition are needed to decrease the discrepancies due to contouring. The treatment must, as far as possible, be delivered with an empty bladder and rectum in order to ensure a good reproduction of the initially planned treatment.","2334":"An inverse planning algorithm for determining the intensity of modulated beams that generates conformal radiotherapy dose distributions is presented. This algorithm is based on the mathematical analysis of the singular values decomposition. It is integrated in the DOSIGRAY 3D treatment planning software. The dose is calculated by the separation of the primary and scattered radiation. We presented, for a prostate cancer, the modulated intensity profiles and the optimal dose distribution obtained by the inverse optimization software developed and integrated in the treatment planning system. We obtained a region with high doses which geometrically conforms the target volume and spares the neighboring critical structures. This preliminary study showed the feasibility and the managing of the singular value decomposition to generate conformal dose distribution in a clinical environment.","2335":"A retrospective study of the in vitro radiosensitivity of skin fibroblasts derived from two groups of patients treated by definitive radiotherapy for a variety of tumors who either displayed or did not display severe complications. Seven radiotherapy patients were selected: three were treated for head and neck, prostate and non-Hodgkin lymphoma tumors, and did not develop any significant complications (control group); four patients were treated for bladder, thyroid, head and neck and anal canal tumors and developed serious acute and especially late reactions (hypersensitive group). Primary cell cultures of skin fibroblasts were established and their radiosensitivity studied by the clonogenic assay after exposing to single radiation doses ranging between 1 and 8 Gy. The survival fraction at 2 Gy (SF2) ranged from 0.27 to 0.38, with a mean of 0.33 for the control group, and from 0.10 to 0.20 with a mean of 0.17 for the hypersensitive group. The Mann-Whitney non-parametric test showed that the difference between the two means was statistically significant (p = 0.03). The data are in favor of a correlation between the radiosensitivity of patients' fibroblasts and the reactions of different normal tissues to radiotherapy. This association supports the use of the clonogenic survival, or a surrogate test, as a predictive assay. The multiplicity of normal tissues and organs implicated in this association suggests the existence of genetic factors that determine, at least in part, the radiosensitivity of target cells involved in the expression of normal tissues complications following radiotherapy. ","2336":"To evaluate the long-term results of external fractionated radiation therapy (RT) in the treatment of intracranial meningiomas. From January 1981 to December 1996, 156 patients with intracranial meningiomas were treated with external fractionated RT. Median age was 57. Indications for radiation therapy were as follows: (1) completely excised histologically aggressive tumors (12 patients); (2) incomplete surgical resection (37 patients); (3) medically inoperable or basilar tumors where operation would involve considerable danger or permanent neurological damage (77 patients); and, (4) tumor recurrences (30 patients). Most patients were irradiated with 6 to 9 MV photon beams. A three to four-field technique with coned-down portals was used. Since 1993, 71 patients had a three dimensional dosimetry. Doses were calculated on the 95% or 98% isodoses, all fields were treated every day, five days a week, for a median total dose of 50 Gy (1.8 Gy\/Fraction). Median follow-up from radiation therapy was 40 months. Acute tolerance was excellent; an early clinical improvement during radiation therapy was noted in 19 patients (17.8%). Clinical improvement or stabilization was observed in 130 patients (83.4%). Radiologically, local control was obtained in 124 cases (79.4%) and tumor recurrences occurred in 21 cases (ten progressions in the treated volume, five borderline, six new locations). Overall and cause specific-survival rates were 75% and 89% at five years, and 45 and 76% at 10 years, respectively. These results reassess the role of fractionated RT in the treatment of intracranial meningiomas. Long-term tolerance is excellent for a majority of patients. The study of recurrences confirms the importance of the definition of the target volume, and asks questions about total given doses. ","2337":"To evaluate retrospectively the long-term results of fractionated radiation therapy (RT) in cerebello-pontine angle neurinomas (CPA). From January 1986 to October 1995, 29 patients with stage III and IV neurinomas were treated with external fractionated RT. One patient was irradiated on both sides and indications for RT were as follows: (1) general contraindications for surgery (16 patients); (2) hearing preservation in bilateral neurinomas after controlateral tumor exeresis (six patients); (3) partial tumor removal (five patients); and, (4) non-surgical recurrence (three patients). A three to four fields technique with coplanar static beams and conformal cerobend blocks was used; doses were calculated on a 95 to 98% isodoses and were given five days a week for a median total dose of 51 Gy (1.8 Gy\/fraction). Most patients were irradiated with 6 to 10 MV photons). Median follow-up was 66 months (seven to 120 months). Seven patients died, two with progressive disease, five from non-tumoral causes. Tumor shrinkage was observed in 13 patients (43.3%), stable disease in 14 (46.6%), and tumor progression in three. Two patients underwent total tumor removal after RT (one stable and one growing tumor). Hearing was preserved in four out of six patients. No patient experienced facial or trigeminal neuropathy. Fractionated RT is a well tolerated and efficacious treatment of large non-surgical CPA neurinomas.

Seventeen consecutive patients were treated from 1978 to 1995 for a primary intracranial germ cell tumor. Median age was 14 (range 3-29 years). There were two malignant teratoma, six proved germinoma and nine presumed germinoma (diagnostic based on biological, radiological and treatment criteria). All received radiotherapy from 30 to 60 Gy (median 40 Gy) in different volumes. Chemotherapy was administered in 15 cases, three after surgery and 12 after radiotherapy. All tumours were in complete remission after initial treatment. The two malignant teratomas recurred in non-irradiated area after nine and 48 months, and the patients died. None of the germinoma recurred within a follow-up period of two to 17 years (median 65 months). Five and 10 year actuarial overall survival rates were the same: 84% for all histologies and 100% for germinomas. Only two patients developed school difficulties and six presented an hypopituitarism, of which one was consecutive to radiotherapy. Chemotherapy was well tolerated. This retrospective study and literature analysis are in favor of limited dose and volume of radiation therapy associated with chemotherapy. ","2339":"Repair pathways of DNA are now better defined, and some important findings have been discovered in the last few years. DNA non-homologous end-joining (NEHJ) is a crucial process in the repair of radiation-induced double-strand breaks (DSBs). NHEJ implies at least three steps: the DNA free-ends must get closer, preparation of the free-ends by exonucleases and then a transient hybridisation in a region of DNA with weak homology. DNA-dependent protein kinase (DNA-PK) is the key enzyme in this process. DNA-PK is a nuclear serine\/threonine kinase that comprises three components: a catlytic subunit (DNA-PKCS) and two regulatory subunits, DNA-binding proteins, Ku80 and Ku70. The severe combined immunodeficient (scid) mice are deficient in DNA-PKCS: this protein is involved both in DNA repair and in the V(D)J recombination of immunoglobulin and T-cell receptor genes. It is a protein-kinase of the P13-kinase family and which can phosphorylates Ku proteins, p53 and probably some other proteins still unknown. DNA-PK is an important actor of DSBs repair (induced by ionising radiations or by drugs like etoposide), but obviously it is not the only mechanism existing in the cell for this function. Some others, like homologous recombination, seem also to have a great importance for cell survival.","2340":"Positron emission tomography (PET) is one of the most promising diagnostic procedures in oncology. Using the glucose analogue fluorodeoxyglucose, PET produces whole-body images and is highly sensitive for tumor diagnosis and staging. We review three particular clinical situations in which PET-FDG has proven not only its diagnostic accuracy, but also its impact on patient management, i.e., the staging of non-small cell lung cancer, diagnosis and staging of colo-rectal cancer and head and neck cancer recurrence. Image registration yields anatomo-metabolic images that could be used as additional information for the determination of radiation fields. Tracer and technical issues remain to be solved before PET can be routinely used for that purpose.","2341":"The computer-based learning methods in medicine have been well established as stand-alone learning systems. Recently, these systems were enriched with the use of telematics technology to provide distance learning capabilities. Stereotactic radiotherapy is one of the most representative advanced radiotherapy techniques. Due to the multidisciplinary character of the technique and the rapid evolution of technology implemented, the demands in training have increased. The potential of interactive multimedia and Internet technologies for the achievement of distance learning capabilities in this domain are investigated. The realization of a computer-based educational program in stereotactic radiotherapy in a multimedia format is a new application in the computer-aided distance learning field. The system is built according to a client and server architecture, based on the Internet infrastructure, and composed of server nodes. The impact of the system may be described in terms of: time and transportation costs saving, flexibility in training (scheduling, rate and subject selection), online communication and interaction with experts, cost effective access to material (delivery or access by a large number of users and revision of the material by avoiding high costs of computer-based training systems and database development).","2342":"Liposarcoma of the larynx is an uncommon tumor. Only 27 cases have been described in literature. We report a new case occurring in a 50-year-old patient. The treatment consisted of a total laryngectomy with lymph node dissection followed by adjuvant irradiation. Prognosis for laryngeal liposarcoma is better than that of non laryngeal liposarcoma. This tumor is at high risk of local recurrence and seldom has metastatic potential.","2343":"Pigmented villonodular synovitis is a rare benign tumor. The high rate or recurrence after surgery exposes the risk of non-conservative or non-functional treatment. External irradiation of post-surgical residual disease seems to be useful for the prevention of relapse and conservation with a good functional result. We report a clinical observation of a case with a diffuse type of pigmented villonodular synovitis of the ankle, operated on three times, and then treated by external irradiation. The published results in terms of response and functional prognosis of 14 cases of multi-recurrent villonodular synovitis treated by irradiation seem to confirm this therapeutic option.","2344":"In this manuscript, we studied the difference in the treatment time required to execute a single-isocentre three-field irradiation of the head and neck, using either tray-mounted cerrobend blocks or a multileaf collimator (MLC) for field shaping and automatic set-up. A total of twenty consecutive, unselected patients (16 males, four females), were eligible for this study because the dose they were to received was 44 Gy (2 Gy\/fraction) to the head, neck and supraclavicular regions. Patients were randomly allocated to one of two treatment groups. The first group (n = 11) was treated on a Philips SL-75 linear accelerator (SL-75), using 5 MV photons and tray-mounted cerrobend blocks. The second group (n = 9) was treated on a Philips SL-25 linear accelerator (SL-25-MLC), using 6 MV photons and a MLC. Patients of the second group were treated using the automatic set-up facility of the SL-25-MLC, without entering the treatment room between consecutive fields. Overall treatment time was significantly shorter on the SL-25-MLC than on the SL-75 (P &lt; 0.0001). The difference in total treatment-execution time was in the range of 157 s per treatment session. The largest difference was observed in the set-up time. There was an average of a 125 s time gain per treatment day (P &lt; 0.0001) in favour of the SL-25-MLC. Compared to tray-mounted cerrobend blocks, a MLC and automatic set-up results in a significant time advantage when a single isocentre technique is used to treat head and neck cancer. ","2345":"To assess retrospectively the long-term results of the combination of surgery and radiotherapy in carcinoma classified cT1. From 1974 to 1993, 137 women suffering from endometrial carcinoma cT1Nx-0 M0 were entered into the study. The median age was 62 years (range: 39-85 years) and the median follow up was 67 months (range: 0-224 months). Surgery was performal in 132 women (96.35%). For cT1, the 5-year overall and specific survivals were 81.1% and 84.5%, respectively. The 10-year overall and specific survivals were 68.8% and 82.2%, respectively. Concerning cT1pT1, the 5-year overall and specific survivals, were 83.9% and 87.4%. The 10-year overall and specific survivals were 71.1% and 85%, respectively. Histological grade, pelvic lymph node involvement and myometrial infiltration influence significantly the overall and specific survivals of cT1pT1 tumors. According to multivariate analysis, pelvic lymph node involvement was a powerful prognostic factor for both the overall and specific survivals. If we rule out pelvic lymph node involvement, WHO histological grade was a significant prognostic factor. Combination of surgery and radiotherapy is still a common procedure for cT1 tumors. When surgery is done before radiotherapy, tailored irradiation may further take place, according to WHO histological grade and pelvic lymph node status.

Median age of the 96 patients was 58 years. Tumor site was: upper limb 20, lower limb 46, trunk 30. In 35 cases largest diameter of the tumor was 5 cm or less (T1). All patients were M0. The most frequent pathological sub type was: malignant histiocytofibroma 28, liposarcoma 28. A gross complete surgery was performed in 89 cases. Radiotherapy was performed with cobalt or x 18 MV photons. The dose delivered was 50 Gy with a boost of 10 Gy. No adjuvant chemotherapy was given. Mean follow up was 68 months. Local relapse was seen in 19 patients, six were salvaged by surgery, a limb amputation rates were necessary in 4 cases. The 5 and 10 year-overall survival was 70% and 64%. There was no severe radiation toxicity requiring surgery. A good function of the limb was preserved in all cases. These results are in agreement with those of the literature and justify a conservative approach for these soft tissues sarcomas. ","2347":"To quantify the possible advantages arising from the use of 'conformal' radiotherapy of localized prostate cancer, and to compare the dose distributions obtained with two different 'conformal' techniques. Twelve patients with localized prostate cancer were enrolled in the study. For each patient, three techniques were planned: the standard 'box technique' (A), a four-fields 'conformal' technique (B), and a 6-fields conformal technique (C). For each of the 36 3D plans, dose-volume histograms (DVH) were obtained, along with the mean, maximum and minimum doses for the clinical and planning target volumes (CTV, PTV) for the rectum, the bladder, and the femoral heads. The resulting data were compared. On average, the standard technique resulted in the exposure of a significantly larger bladder volume to the higher doses; a similar, but less remarkable difference has been observed for the rectal volume. The coverage of the PTV appears to be significantly more homogeneous with the two conformal techniques. The results presented here add to the evidence available in the literature and suggest a possible advantage of both the conformal techniques over the standard 'box technique' for the treatment of localized prostate cancer. The 6-field conformal technique does not seem superior to the four field one. ","2348":"The carcinogenic effect of low doses of ionizing radiation has been a matter of much debate over the last few years. The French Academy of Science published a report on the subject in 1995. The central point of discussion concerns the validity of the linear no threshold relationship for estimating, by extrapolation, the carcinogenic effect of low doses. The aim of this article is to analyze the epidemiological data on the effect of low doses and the biological data on the mechanisms of carcinogenesis that have been obtained since 1995. These data strengthen doubts concerning the validity of current risk evaluations at low doses.","2349":"","2350":"","2351":"The importance of the quality of radiotherapy for Hodgkin's disease has been stressed, particularly in specific American and German studies. A quality control program for verification of technical files for each patient was implemented during the EORTC H8 protocol for patients with a supra-diaphragmatic stage I &amp; II Hodgkin's disease. Today, 161 technical files have been reviewed. While the definition of the target volumes were in accordance with the protocol for most of the patients, we observed 13.6% of major deviations in terms of treated volumes, and 39.7% of major deviations in terms of dose (for volumes, a number of deviations were in the cervical areas, where the upper limit of the field was lowered in view of protecting the parotids, but the others were due to inadequate margins around the mediastinum and the hilum). Some of the dose deviations were due, in some cases, to the addition of a sub-carinal block after 30 Gy, but also, in cervical areas, in misinterpretation of the protocol. In conclusion, such a quality control program is justified by the number of major deviations which have been observed; it seems justified to carry out this program in the future H9 protocol.","2352":"Children treated for malignant hemopathy have a very good prognosis, yet late effects of the treatments on the length, endocrine function, cognitive function and the risk of secondary malignant tumors must be decreased. These toxicities are described in this article. New protocols and radiation techniques have been developed to reduce these effects. Radiotherapy is prescribed in the treatment of non-Hodgkin lymphoma to prevent high risk of meninges recurrences or to treat meninges disease associated with chemotherapy. Doses of cranial irradiation are limited to 24 Gy. A SFOP trial concluded that doses of 20 Gy are sufficient after good responses to chemotherapy for the treatment of Hodgkin's disease. The target volume is reduced to the initial site of the disease.","2353":"Radiation techniques and indications in leukemias have been described in detail, yet prophylactic cranial irradiation in acute leukemia still has few indications. Cerebrospinal and testicular irradiation are reserved for relapsing disease. Radiation usually results in rapid functional improvement when used in neurologic emergencies and symptomatic neurologic or gross tumors relapses. Nevertheless, the improvements recently obtained by systemic chemotherapy have resulted in the reduction in the use of irradiation, especially in children, where it was considered deleterious with neuropsychological sequellae. Splenic irradiation remains useful for symptomatic myeloproliferative syndrome.","2354":"Total-body irradiation (TBI) has an established role in many preparative regimens used before bone marrow transplantation (BMT) in the treatment of hematological malignancies in children and adults. Better choice in TBI techniques and dosimetry have permitted better homogeneity of dose, and therefore a significant sparing of critical tissues. Advances in treatments over the past 20 years have greatly improved survival; therefore, the evaluation of early and late complications, with a sufficient follow-up, according to different conditioning regimens is important. In this article, we review and compare different TBI techniques and dosimetry, and their influence on the distribution and homogeneity of dose, and the possible relationship to the risk of complications. We also describe the acute and late effects of TBI in children and adults appearing in the first month post-BMT as veno-occlusive disease, interstitial pneumonitis, or after 3 months, i.e., endocrinal late effects and growth in children, cataracts, neurological and bone or other complications, secondary tumors and alteration in the quality of life. The responsibility of TBI in the increased rate of certain complications is difficult to assess from chemotherapy or allograft side effects (chronic graft vs. host disease) or from other associated medical treatments, such as long term steroid therapy.","2355":"A comprehensive understanding of the radiobiological bases of total body irradiation (TBI) is made difficult by the large number of normal and malignant tissues that must be taken into account. In addition, tissue responses to irradiation are also sensitive to associated treatments, type of graft and a number of patient characteristics. Experimental studies have yielded a large body of data, the clinical relevance of which still requires definite validation through randomized trials. Fractionated TBI schemes are able to reduce late normal tissue toxicity, but the ultimate consequences of the fractional dose reduction do not appear to be equivocal. Thus, leukemia and lymphoma cells are probably more radiobiologically heterogeneous than previously thought, with several cell lines displaying relatively high radioresistance and repair capability patterns. The most primitive host-type hematopoietic stem cells are likely to be at least partly protected by TBI fractionation and may hamper late engraftment. Similarly, but with possibly conflicting consequences on the probability of engraftment, the persistence of a functional marrow stroma may also be fractionation-sensitive, while higher rejection rates have been reported after T-depletion grafts and fractionated TBI. In clinical practice (as for the performance of relevant clinical trials), the influence of these results are rather limited by the heavy logistic constraints created by a sophisticated and time-consuming procedure. Lastly, clinicians are now facing an increasing incidence of second cancers, at least partly induced by irradiation, which jeopardize the long-term prospects of otherwise cured patients.","2356":"Primary cerebral lymphoma is a rare disease with an unfavorable prognosis. Whole brain radiotherapy has been the standard treatment, but neither the optimal radiation fields nor optimal dose level of the regimen are as yet firmly established. From this review of the literature, it seems that the whole brain must be treated, and a boost to the area of the primary site must be discussed. With regard to dose, the radiation dose-response relationship is not clearly proven. Yet, a minimum dose of 40 Gy is necessary, and the maximum dose is set at 50 Gy because of late neurological sequelae. Because of the poor prognosis of this disease and the risk of late sequelaes, other avenues have been explored. Chemotherapy has been studied, seem to have a survival advantage and combinations of radiotherapy and chemotherapy, especially with high-dose methotrexate. Because primary cerebral lymphoma is an uncommon disease, randomized clinical trials that compare radiotherapy alone to chemotherapy plus radiotherapy may not be feasible. Finally, even if chemotherapy seems to have a survival advantage, the regimen of chemotherapy is still a matter of debate.","2357":"Gastrointestinal lymphomas are almost exclusively of a non-Hodgkin's type. The Western form is characterized by a higher incidence of stomach location (50%), a MALT type (mucosa associated lymphoid tissue) (40%), a B-cell type (90%), and a high grade (55%). Chronic infection with Helicobacter pylori is an important risk factor. Mediterranean lymphomas form a particular clinical and pathological entity with diffuse involvement of the small bowel and are frequently being associated with a chronic malabsorption disorder. Eradication of Helicobacter pylori in early gastric lymphomas, and the use of tetracyclines in early Mediterranean lymphomas, have been shown to induce durable remissions. For more advanced gastric lymphomas, treatment usually consists of anthracyclin-based chemotherapy followed by involved field radiotherapy. Surgery is usually reserved for complications such as perforation or bleeding, or in some selected cases for salvage after failure of non-surgical therapy. For intestinal lymphomas, surgical resection whenever feasible, followed by anthracyclin-based chemotherapy is the most common treatment. Radiotherapy is usually reserved for consolidation in some clinical situations. The most commonly found prognostic factors are stage, grade, and tumor bulk. Treatment results vary with the presence of adverse prognostic factors and the used treatment combination. In general, patients with favorable disease receiving combined therapy have a 5-year relapse free survival (RFS) approaching 90%, whereas those with unfavorable disease have a RFS of 40-50%.","2358":"RADIOTHERAPY OF ADULT NODAL NON HODGKIN'S LYMPHOMA: The role of radiotherapy in the treatment of nodal non-Hodgkin's lymphoma has been modified by the introduction of efficient chemotherapy and the development of different pathological classifications. INTERMEDIATE GRADE OR HIGH GRADE LYMPHOMA: The recommended treatment of early-stage aggressive lymphomas is primarily a combination chemotherapy. The interest of adjuvant radiotherapy remains unclear and has to be established through large prospective trials. If radiation therapy has to be delivered, the historical results of exclusive radiation therapy showed that involved-fields and a dose of 35-40 Gy (daily fraction of 1.8 Gy, 5 days a week) are the optimal schedule. The interest of radiotherapy in the treatment of advanced-stage aggressive lymphoma is yet to be proven. Further studies had to stratify localized stages according to the factors of the International Prognostic Index. LOW-GRADE LYMPHOMA: For early-stage low-grade lymphoma, radiotherapy remains the standard treatment. However, the appropriate technique to use is controversial. Involved-field irradiation at a dose of 35 Gy seems to be the optimal schedule, providing a 10-year disease-free survival rate of 50% and no major toxicity. There is no standard indication of radiotherapy in the treatment advanced-stage low-grade lymphoma. RARE AND NEW ENTITY: For \"new\" nodal lymphoma's types, the indication of radiotherapy cannot be established (mantle-zone lymphoma, marginal zone B-cell lymphoma) or must take into account the natural history (Burkitt's lymphoma, peripheral T-cell lymphoma) and the sensibility to others therapeutic methods.","2359":"The use of radiotherapy in advanced stages of Hodgkin's disease remains controversial. The rationale for its use is based on efficacy at all stages of the disease as well as in patients with recurrent disease, but also on the topography of the recurrences after exclusive chemotherapy (which occur at non irradiated sites in 75% of cases), and on its ability to improve relapse rates as shown in many randomized trials. Unfortunately, this improvement does not translate into higher survival rates because of the increased late morbidity and an inadequate selection of patients who might benefit from irradiation. The benefits of radiotherapy are probably the highest in stage III rather than IV, in patients with scleronodular disease, and in those with mediastinal involvement experiencing a complete response to radiotherapy. A better survival should be observed with the shift towards a decrease of the doses delivered, an improvement of the quality of the irradiation, and a better definition of the volumes to be treated in association with the use of optimal chemotherapies.","2360":"The role of radiotherapy in limited stage Hodgkin's disease (HD) has been gradually changing in the past few decades, resulting in the almost complete disappearance of exclusive irradiation treatment. In reality, exclusive radiotherapy yielded satisfactory results in terms of long-term survival, but in 1999 it was becoming impossible not to take into account the late mortality rates observed in all large cohorts of HD patients. This increased mortality rate has been shown to be related to 1) cardiac toxicity of irradiation, and 2) secondary radiation-induced solid tumors. Thus, the search for efficient but less toxic new strategies can no longer be avoided. For clinically staged, limited HD, precisely defined according to specific prognostic factors, the association of chemotherapy and radiotherapy appears more and more as a standard, and with this therapeutic burden comes parallel efforts for its alleviation. The Previous Radiotherapy experience has shown that, after a chemotherapy-induced complete remission, irradiation of only the initially involved areas was enough. Ongoing trials are now exploring the possibility of a dose de-escalation, from the conventional 36 Gy to 20 Gy (as for children HD), and to maybe 0 Gy (no radiotherapy at all). In parallel, deescalation in the number of chemotherapy cycles is also being investigated. For unfavorable cases, the problem is slightly different, as a higher percentage of cases still appears to be refractory to treatment in this subgroup. Thus, while chemo-radiotherapy has clearly became the standard strategy, efforts are essentially being devoted to identify new--and hopefully more efficient--chemotherapy schemes. In Europe, most of these pending questions will be addressed in the recently initiated trials of the EORTC\/GELA and of the GHSG (German Hodgkin Study Group), with the aim of offering to patients treatment which could be at least as efficient as the present schedules, and less toxic in the long term.","2361":"Radiotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of cutaneous lymphomas. In the treatment of Mycosis fungoides, total skin electron beam radiation therapy is efficient for patients with limited and superficial forms of the disease. Radiotherapy is also efficient for the locally advanced forms of non-epidermotropic lymphomas. The palliative radiotherapy is indicated for advanced, nodular and treatment resistant forms of cutaneous lymphomas and for voluminous lymphadenopathies.","2362":"","2363":"","2364":"Etoposide, a Topoisomerase II inhibitor agent, is currently being explored as a therapeutic agent for brain tumors. The aim of this experimental study was to compare the in vitro etoposide sensitivity of human glioma cells vs human squamous cell carcinoma (SCC) cells. Twelve human cell lines (six malignant glioma cell lines and six head and neck SCC cell lines) were used for this comparative study. A standard colony formation assay was used to assess cell survival. Since Topoisomerase II is the critical target for etoposide, it was of interest to determine Topoisomerase II activity and etoposide induced inhibition of Topoisomerase II activity for the glioma cells vs the SCC cells. Except for etoposide-induced inhibition of Topoisomerase II activity, no difference was found for etoposide sensitivity and Topoisomerase II activity between the both type of cells. These results suggested that the Topoisomerase II reactive agents may prove to be clinically a useful drug for patients presenting with malignant gliomas. ","2365":"Paclitaxel is an agent which stabilizes microtubules, and has been shown to block different cells in the G2\/M phase of the cell cycle and thus to modulate their radioresponsiveness. We investigated the radiosensitizing potential of paclitaxel in human head and neck cancer cells. ZMK-1 cells were incubated with paclitaxel for 3, 9, or 24 h before or during 24 h after irradiation. Paclitaxel concentrations of 70 nM, 7 nM, and 0.7 nM were chosen to obtain equivalent toxicity at the different incubation times: 3 h, 9 h, and 24 h, respectively. Radiation doses ranged from 0 to 8 Gy using 60Co source. Cell survival was measured by a standard clonogenic assay after a 9-day incubation. Flow cytometry was used to measure the capacity of paclitaxel to accumulate cells in the G2\/M phase. Paclitaxel alone possessed cytotoxicity dependent on time and concentration. There was a total of 40% of cells accumulated in G2\/M after 24-36 h. When combined with radiation, the 9 h preincubation resulted in a radiosensitization. The 3 h pre-incubation as well as the 24 h post-incubation resulted in an infra-additive effect. In our cells a radiosensitizing effect of paclitaxel could not be demonstrated unambiguously. The blockage of the cells in the G2\/M phase is not the only mechanism to explain the potential radiosensitization of paclitaxel. ","2366":"Retrospective study to analyze the results of external beam radiation treatment with or without surgery for loco-regional recurrence of adenocarcinoma of the rectum following previous surgery without pre- or post-operative radiotherapy. Between March 1973 and November 1991, 211 patients with loco-regional recurrence of rectum cancer were treated with external beam radiation treatment. Radical surgery was the only initial treatment modality. Surgical resection of local recurrence was done in 36 patients and only 17 patients could undergo complete resection. Forty-seven patients underwent radiotherapy (RT) combined with surgery and 164 received external beam radiation treatment alone to a mean total dose of 46 Gy. Among the 151 patients whose recurrence was revealed by pain, 64 (42%) were considered to have a complete symptomatic response after loco-regional treatment with radiosurgery or RT alone. The mean duration of response was 12 months. The 3-year overall survival rate was 16%. Five prognostic factors decreased the overall survival rate in multivariate analysis: high age, sex (male), concomitant distant metastasis, no tumor resection, and low total radiation dose with external beam radiation treatment alone. The 3-year overall survival rate for patients with completely resected recurrences was 39%. External beam RT treatment can only be considered a palliative symptomatic treatment. New techniques of early detection of local recurrence and new combined modalities approaches (radiation sensitizers or intra-operative radiotherapy) with surgical resection in some favorable cases should be studied. ","2367":"Cisplatin (CDDP) and radiotherapy are frequently used concomitantly in the treatment of various malignant conditions. Because of its toxicity, cisplatin tends to be replaced by carboplatin (CBDCA) in several indications. Available data regarding the combined effects of cisplatin and carboplatin with ionising radiation are contradictory. Various concentrations of cisplatin and carboplatin and various timing of association with radiation have been tested in vitro in a human ovarian cancer cell line. The parental cell line (AOvC-0) and a cisplatin-resistant stable subline (AOvC-CDDP\/0) (De Pooter et al., Canc Res, 1991) were exposed to carboplatin (2.5, 5 and 10 M) and to CDDP (1, 2.5 and 5 M), 16 h and 4 h before and 4 h and 16 h after irradiation, respectively. Cell survival was evaluated by a classical clonogenic assay. Exposure of AOvC-0 to 5 M CBDCA and of AOvC-CDDP\/0 to 10 M CBDCA, before or shortly after radiation exposure, increased cell lethality in a clear supra-additive way, with the highest DEF in the shoulder region of the survival curve and at radiation doses relevant to clinical radiotherapy. In the sensitive cell line, 5 M carboplatin resulted in an additional lethality equivalent to 4.5 Gy; in the resistant cells, 10 M carboplatin was equivalent to 3.6 Gy. Replacing carboplatin by cisplatin in an identical set-up demonstrated exclusively simple additivity (DEF = 1). These data suggest that carboplatin and cisplatin delivered at equitoxic doses interact with radiation in a different way and that, in the present set-up, only carboplatin enhanced the effects of radiation. Carboplatin might consequently be a better candidate than cisplatin in some concomitant combinations with radiotherapy.

EORTC trial 22863 alone has shown a significant improvement of overall survival (P = 0.001), with an LHRH analogue (goserilin acetate, zoladex) started the first day of irradiation and followed every 4 weeks for 3 years; for RTOG trial 85-31 the same LHRH analogue started during the last week of irradiation and given until relapse increases survival of patients with poor differentiated tumours with gleason score ranging from 8 to 10 (P = 0.03). In locally confined prostate carcinoma randomized trials are ongoing to assess the impact of conventional irradiation or three dimensional conformal radiotherapy with or without adjuvant hormonotherapy.","2373":"","2374":"Hypoxic cells are present in rodent and xenografted human tumours and it has been known for a long time that the absence of oxygen in tumours is a factor of resistance against ionising radiation. The dose modifying role of oxygen (oxygen enhancement ratio) has been largely studied in experimental models. For pO2 values of 2 mmHg, the relative radiosensitivity of tumour cells is intermediate between the maximum sensitivity observed in air and the minimal one observed in hypoxia. The measurement of tumour pO2 in patients (polarographic technique) has demonstrated the presence of low values (&lt; 10 mmHg) in many different tumour sites (ENT, uterine cervix, breast, melanoma, etc). In order to sensitise hypoxic tumours, imidazole have been used in patients, but most of the results were negative. New methods have been developed in the combination of bioreductive drugs of cytotoxic cells to radiotherapy. In this article, we will describe the clinical results obtained in patients with radiosensitising chemical agents.","2375":"The last of the therapeutic modalities proposed for exocrine adenocarcinoma of the pancreas which appears to be potentially resectable, neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy has many prerequisites: validation of the diagnosis, determination of resectability with a high degree of confidence and palliation of biliary obstruction when present. This rather complex strategy does not seem to have major deleterious effects on the operative procedure or the postoperative course. Only multicentric protocols will, in the near future, give an answer to the question of secondary toxic effects and improvement of survival of this new therapeutic strategy.","2376":"Prognosis of oesophageal cancer is poor. There have been phase II-III trials of postoperative chemotherapy with the aim of improving survival. Chemoradiotherapy seems more promising than both chemotherapy and radiotherapy alone. In contrast, better results obtained with chemoradiotherapy were associated with an increase in morbidity and mortality, and finally overall survival was uncommonly improved. It is necessary to implement new multidisciplinary randomised trial.","2377":"Neoadjuvant chemotherapy is aimed to allow tumor debulking, organ sparing treatment and survival increase. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy has proven its ability to perform conservative treatment in breast, head and neck, bladder, oesophageal cancers and osteosarcoma. It has not yet proven its impact on overall survival. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy requires further studies.","2378":"The high chemosensitivity of pediatric tumors along with their natural propensity for an early distant dissemination have stimulated the interest for chemo-radiation combinations in children since the mid 50s. Following the early experiments in nephroblastomas on the interaction of Actinomycin-D and radiotherapy, multiple national and international studies have been conducted since the mid 70s with considerable success: nowadays most pediatric tumors enjoy a long term survival in excess of 70%. Like their adult counterparts, these associations aim to induce an early control of the primary tumor and distant spreading (spatial cooperation) but also, more specifically in children, to limit the toxicity on normal tissues when treatment intensity can be further reduced. The association of an initial chemotherapy followed by local radiation at a dose and in a volume adapted to the response to chemotherapy along with associated prognostic factors has become widely tested in national and international studies conducted in Hodgkin's disease, Ewing's sarcoma, medulloblastomas, and brain tumors in the very young. Conversely, concomitant associations have remained limited to high-risk subgroups (parameningeal rhabdomyosarcomas for example) due to their potential hazards.","2379":"The goal of postoperative treatment in adult soft tissue sarcoma is local control, and in high-risk patients prevention of distant failures. Radiation therapy is essential after non-radical surgery. The role of adjuvant chemotherapy on improvement of overall survival remains to be evidenced; however, recent meta-analysis data have confirmed its impact on both local and metastatic evolution of the disease. Because for both radiotherapy and chemotherapy, delay of treatment may be crucial for efficacy following tumor excision, concomitant radiochemotherapy should be considered. Review of the literature as well as personal results showed the feasibility of postoperative radiochemotherapy in adult soft tissue sarcoma, even when the chemotherapeutic associations used included an anthracycline. Prospective study of radiochemotherapy should be performed in order to assess its real impact in terms of efficacy and toxicity.","2380":"Cutaneous melanoma represents the main cause of death among skin cancers. Early diagnosis gives, for the time being, the only possibility for high rate of curative treatment. Diagnosis is based on pathological findings, and at primary tumor stage. Breslow thickness of the lesion is the best prognostic index. At local stage of the disease, treatment is precisely codified by international recommendations and consensus conferences. Follow-up after surgical treatment is also well codified. Treatment of lymph node invasion or metastatic disease is, on the other hand, less codified. Despite recent advances, especially in immunotherapy, treatment of advanced stages of melanoma remains difficult.","2381":"Concomitant radiochemotherapy is of potential interest in the treatment of early stage breast cancer. Radiotherapy improves local control after both conservative surgery and mastectomy and in this last case also improves overall survival. Some questions however still exist concerning the role of the delay between surgery and radiotherapy on the efficacy of this treatment. Over 6 months, the benefit due to radiotherapy could be reduced. Adjuvant chemotherapy leads to improved survival in all categories of patients with breast cancer, either with or without axillary-node involvement. Anthracyclin-containing regimens seem to be the most efficient, but their superiority on \"historical\" standard regimens such as cyclophosphamide-methotrexate-5-fluorouracil has never been fully established. Chemotherapy and radiotherapy have synergistic effects. Used simultaneously, their effect on residual disease after surgery could be increased. Moreover, this therapeutic modality enables reduction of treatment duration as well as the delay between surgery and radiotherapy. Some studies have demonstrated the good tolerance of concomitant radiotherapy and FNC (5-fluoro-uracil, mitoxantrone and cyclophosphamide) or CMF. Three French randomized trials testing the value of concomitant vs sequential radiotherapy + chemotherapy are ongoing. However, careful and critical interpretation of survival data will be required to consider concomitant chemoradiotherapy as a standard adjuvant treatment of early stage breast cancer.","2382":"Treatment of uterine cervix carcinomas is based on radiotherapy and surgery. Prognosis of advanced carcinoma leads to the proposal of many combinations. Only concurrent radio-chemotherapy demonstrated some interests. Combination of radiotherapy and radiosensitisers failed to demonstrate any advantage and in some instances was associated with an adverse effect. Hydroxyurea and mitomycin C alone or associated were extensively tested without benefit. From modern combinations and recent studies, we could conclude that only cisplatin (and probably its derivates) can be included in future trials.","2383":"Until now, radical cystectomy has been considered the most effective treatment for invasive bladder cancer. However it fails to cure more than 50% of patients and can result in a mediocre quality of life. In an effort to improve cure rates, combined modality regimens have been investigated. Despite the preliminary results of early clinical trials, randomized trials have most often failed to show any benefit from neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. One of the major progress brought by radiotherapy has been the wide use of conservative treatment in several cancer, and in the recent years promising results have been published with concomitant radio-chemotherapy. The use of conservative approach in bladder cancer now appears to be a tangible reality for selected patients, but this combined modality have not yet been tested in randomized trials.","2384":"In the treatment of anal canal carcinoma, since the work of Nigro, the 5-fluorouracil-mitomycin C regimen is considered standard when applied concomitantly with radiotherapy. Surgery is used mainly to salvage the failures after irradiation. Two randomized European trials (EORTC, UKCCCR) have shown that the 5-fluorouracil-mitomycin C combination improves local control but not overall survival. The RTOG-ECOG trial has shown that mitomycin C improves local control when compared to 5-fluorouracil alone. This chemotherapy is responsible for a toxic death in 2% of cases. The 5-fluorouracil-cisplatin regimen will possibly represent an alternative to the 5-fluorouracil-mitomycin C. Ongoing trials will help to answer this question.","2385":"Increasing local control remains a major endpoint in the adjuvant setting of rectal cancer. Postoperative concurrent 5FU-based chemotherapy and irradiation demonstrated its value in Duke's B and C patients. Toxicity decreased from the first studies to the current one's in relation with better radiotherapy technique, reduction of chemotherapy duration and quality assurance programs. Because preoperative irradiation alone has demonstrated its value on local control and overall survival, preoperative combined chemoradiotherapy should be investigated. Phase III trials are ongoing comparing preoperative radiochemotherapy to either preoperative irradiation alone or to postoperative radiochemotherapy. At this moment, if the patient has been operated, radiochemotherapy and additional chemotherapy should be offered in the case of Duke's B-C tumor. On the other hand, it should be preferably offered preoperative radiotherapy in case of T3 resectable T4 and hopefully in the context of a controlled clinical trial investigating preoperative concurrent radiochemotherapy.","2386":"The prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains poor, with a 5-year survival rate lower than 5%. Resection, the gold standard treatment, can be performed in less than 10% of patients. Following surgery, the median survival is 12 months for the most favorable cancer patients. Concomitant chemoradiation, as an adjuvant treatment is superior to surgery alone, in terms of survival; controlled trials are currently performed. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation is a new approach, potentially able to increase survival and resection rate. This work justifies the role of these schemes, in terms of modalities and potential advantages. A second part is dedicated to gastric carcinoma, with a review of the current results of chemoradiation, whose efficiency, even though a trend can be observed, remains to be proven. Prospective adjuvant combined treatments are ongoing, in France and in the States.","2387":"Radiation therapy with concomitant chemotherapy is the standard treatment for non resectable esophageal carcinoma. For patients with operable tumors, surgery is the traditional treatment. However several data have suggested that preoperative chemo- and radiotherapy could improve therapeutic results. At the present time, no randomized trial has demonstrated, except for adenocarcinoma of the cardia, the benefit of preoperative treatment. Other randomized trials are needed to determine the role and the optimal modalities of these treatments. This is a review of the literature data in concomitant chemotherapy and radiation in the management of esophagus.","2388":"The objective of this study was to review randomized trials which evaluated the effect of the radio-chemotherapy in head and neck carcinoma, and which compared radiotherapy alone vs the same local treatment plus chemotherapy. Over 40 such randomized trials have been performed, which generally showed no statistical difference between both arms. However few trials showed a benefit which is almost always in favor of the CT arm. Indeed, some trials of concomitant chemoradiotherapy have shown a statistically significant benefit in favor of the combined treatment. On the contrary, neoadjuvant chemotherapy generally leads to no detectable benefit compared to radiotherapy alone. These results have been reinforced by those of four randomized trials comparing neoadjuvant chemoradiotherapy and the same chemotherapy but given concomitantly with radiotherapy. The global effect of chemotherapy on survival of patients with head &amp; neck squamous cell carcinoma has been recently evaluated by a meta-analysis based on individual patient data which included more than 10,000 patients from 63 randomized trials. The absolute survival rate benefit at 5 years is 4%, but is more pronounced in the concomitant combinations (8% at 5 years). In tumors classified as \"T3\" of the pharyngo-larynx, neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy in good responders can avoid a total laryngectomy without significantly compromised survival. In the nasopharynx carcinoma, a few randomized studies have been performed, suggesting a benefit in favor of chemoradiotherapy. Finally, future randomized trials will determine what are the optimal chemoradiotherapy schedules, as well as determining what is the best radiotherapy (accelerated, hyperfractionated) to use in combination with chemotherapy.","2389":"The prognosis of adult patients with malignant gliomas remains poor despite advances in neurosurgery and radiotherapy. Even if chemotherapy has done little to improve on these results, except in the treatment of oligodendrogliomas, many authors have proposed to test the effect of radiotherapy by adding concomitant chemotherapy. Unfortunately, the analysis of these studies is difficult because all these protocols are different with a small number of patients. Furthermore, there are only a few studies evaluated in well controlled clinical trials with homogeneous patient population. Important factors such as tumor grade, patient age, and Karnofsky score, which have a strong influence on survival in malignant gliomas, are not clearly evaluated. Whatever, all these studies suggest that concomitant radio-chemotherapy seems not be promising in the treatment of malignant gliomas.","2390":"There is clear evidence for a cancer cure. The hypothesis behind a treatment with curative intent is the ability to eradicate all the cancer cells of a tumour. Out of three cancer deaths, one is related to local failure. In some cancers like breast carcinoma, death is mainly in relation with the development of distant metastases. Even in such a tumour, an improvement in local control can translate as better survival. Radiation therapy, often in association with surgery, is playing a major role in tumour local control. Such a local control is mandatory if cure is at aim. One of the main goals of clinical research is to find a good compromise between local control of the disease and a non mutilating surgical approach.","2391":"The efficacy of concurrent radiochemotherapy should be evaluated in term of therapeutic ratio. The aims of treatment are increasing local control and possibly overall survival. Acute toxicity should be reported using the WHO recommendations, while late toxicity is reported using the scales recommended by the EORTC and RTOG Radiotherapy Groups. Moreover, functional, esthetic and quality of life considerations should be introduced. The application of these treatments needs a well-designed multidisciplinary staff.","2392":"","2393":"Radio-chemotherapy combinations, especially their concomitant associations, are widely used in the treatment of cancer. The development of these associations has been so far related more to clinical research than to laboratory experiments. The biological basis of the use of these agents relies on their complementarity which concerns the cellular and molecular mechanisms involved in lethality (hypoxia, sensitivity throughout the cycle, DNA repair, apoptosis), spatial and temporal cooperation, etc. Laboratory experiments can determine favorable conditions for additivity, or supra-additivity, but also for infra-additive interactions as well as real antagonism which should be avoided in the clinic. It is however often difficult to transfer this information into the clinic since the conditions which allow additivity or supra-additivity are generally very narrow, and unlikely to be realised in the patient. General clinical conditions are more compatible with infra-additive interactions.","2394":"The idea of combining radiotherapy and chemotherapy goes back to the very beginning of the antimitotic drugs era. At that time, this association was mainly based on a simple concept: spatial cooperation. The first period was one of so-called \"adjuvant\" (post-irradiation) chemotherapy, soon followed by the once-fashionable \"neo-adjuvant\" chemotherapy era. Today, concomitant administration of both therapies, mainly based on radiosensitization, appears promising, although the previous schemes were clearly efficient for some specific indications. In 1998, radiochemotherapy combinations represent an unavoidable part of the anticancer strategy. A number of them have been recognized as the standard treatment for some localizations, and there is little risk to imagine that this number will increase within the next decade.","2395":"The determination of the various volumes (GTV: gross target volume, CTV: clinical target volume, PTV: planned target volume) recommended by the ICRU 50 report is a critical step in conformal treatment planning, since treatment optimisation procedures and documentation rely on accurate dose-volume histograms. The shape and the size of the CTV vary with the computer algorithm, the patient image acquisition parameters, the definition of the GTV and the margins surrounding it. The automatic expansion programs included in commercially available treatment planning system require careful validation and control before and during their routine use by the clinicians. Significant differences have been observed between 2D- and 3D-based expansions, with a usual underestimation of the PTV by 2D algorithms.","2396":"The determination of the target volumes and the dose to be delivered are critical medical steps in order to locally control the disease and to limit the risks of normal tissues injury. While many clinical situations are compatible with standardised technique and beam arrangements, the tools provided by modern medical diagnostic imaging procedures and tridimensional dosimetry allow an improved conformation of the irradiated volume and the administered dose to the clinical target volume. However, this approach requires an increased precision in tumour and normal tissues delineation, based on patient immobilisation devices, standardisation of mobile organs repletion status and image acquisition procedures, explicit definition of the biological and physical safety margins, definition of acceptable levels of dose heterogeneity in the planning target volume and appropriate quality assurance procedures.","2397":"Due to the evolution of radiotherapy techniques and equipment, in 1993 the ICRU decided to modify the guidelines that had been published in the ICRU report 29 (1978) in regard to photon beam therapy and to insert them in Report number 50 (1993). Changes that were introduced mainly concerned the prescription, recording and reporting of external beam therapy with photons. While awaiting for the upcoming publication of the report focusing on external beam therapy with electrons, the ICRU decided to publish a supplement to Report 50, as new insights had been gained after discussions with the Nordic Association of Clinical Physicists (NACP). This supplement includes the following: more accurate definitions of the margins allowing the planned target volume to be derived from the clinical target volume, the internal target volume, the expected volume of organs at-risk and the conformity index. All three points will be included in the report focusing on external beam therapy with electrons as well as extensive discussions relating to the implementation of these new recommendations.","2398":null,"2399":"Combined chemotherapy and radiotherapy can improve the survival of patients with locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, when compared to irradiation alone. This survival benefit is essentially due to an increased control of distant micrometastases, whereas local control remains poor. In order to improve local control, new radiotherapy modalities such as 3D conformal treatment, hyperfractionation or accelerated hyperfractionation, are under development. Cytotoxic drugs given at low doses concomitantly to radiotherapy may act as radiosensitizers on the primary tumor. Concomitant chemotherapy at cytotoxic doses and radiotherapy would also allow better control on micrometastases and better local control due to radiosensitization by chemotherapy. However, the concomitant use of chemotherapy and radiotherapy is limited by increased toxicity on normal tissues, more particularly on the esophagus. Randomized comparisons of these modalities versus induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy are needed to determine the optimal treatment sequence.","2400":"Chemoradiation is the standard treatment of unresectable, locally advanced non-small cell lung cancer, with a mean dose of 60-66 Gy, excluding escalation dose schemes. The standard treated volume includes primary tumor, ipsilateral hilar and mediastinal nodes, supraclavicular and contralateral nodes as well, regardless of the node status. This work tries to answer the question of the optimal volume to be treated. Drainage routes analysis is in favor of large volumes, while toxicity analysis favors small volumes. Combined modality treatment may increase the observed toxicity. The optimal volume definition is difficult, and requires available conformal therapy tools. Patients selection is another important issue. A volume definition is then attempted, based on the IASLC (International Association for the Study of Lung Cancer) Annecy workshop experience, highlighting the interobservers discrepancies, and suggests basic recommendations to harmonize volume definition.","2401":"The optimal radiation schedule (dose, fractionation, volume) must be adapted to the goal of the treatment: cure with radiation alone or a radiochemotherapy approach or palliation. The former implies to deliver a dose of 60 Gy or more in 6 weeks or an equivalent biological doses. This approach should take into account the different prognostic factors (tumor size, extension...) and the technical possibilities (volume of normal tissue irradiated). Doses above 70 Gy should still be reserved for clinical investigation (conformal radiotherapy).","2402":"According to the TNM staging system for lung cancers, stage III is divided into IIIA and IIIB. This division was based upon the principle that patients with IIIA disease could theoretically benefit from complete resection, contrasting with IIIB patients for whom surgery is not feasible. The poor prognosis of stage IIIB is largely due to its classical inoperability. From the surgical point of view, stage IIIB can be subdivided into four subgroups: 1) N3 where resection is possible in selected patients through median sternotomy; 2) T4 where extended surgery can be considered in selected patients; 3) N3 + T4; 4) malignant pleural or pericardial effusion contraindicating any radical surgery. Criteria for resectability could be defined to include some IIIB patients in multimodality protocols in which surgery would become possible after induction therapy: definitive inoperability excludes any possibility of surgery, even in cases in which radiotherapy alone or combined with chemotherapy leads to complete remission; immediate inoperability allows patients to be included in protocols evaluating induction treatments designed to render tumours resectable.","2403":"","2404":"Radiotherapy plays an important role in the treatment of skin tumours. For skin carcinomas, external irradiation (kilovoltage X-rays or electrons according to clinical characteristics) is more valuable than interstitial brachytherapy, which is recommended for tumours of the lip and of the nasal vestibule. In mycosis fungoides, total cutaneous electron beam radiation therapy is efficient for patients with limited superficial plaques. In the classical form of Kaposi's sarcoma, radiotherapy can achieve local control whereas it obtains good palliative results in the epidemic form.","2405":"The induction of malignant diseases is one of the most concerning late effects of ionising radiation. A large amount of information has been collected form atomic bomb survivors, patients after therapeutic irradiation, occupational follow-up and accidentally exposed populations. Major uncertainties persist in the (very) low dose range i.e., population and workers radioprotection. A review of the biological mechanisms leading to cancer strongly suggests that the vast majority of radiation-induced malignancies arise as a consequence of recessive mutations of tumour-suppressor genes. These mutations can be unveiled by ageing, this process being possibly furthered by constitutional or acquired genomic instability. The individual risk is likely to be very low, probably because of the usual dose level. However, the magnitude of medical exposure and the reliance of our societies on nuclear industry are so high that irreproachable decision-making processes and standards for practice are inescapable.","2406":"Some rare hereditary syndromes demonstrate high cancer risk and hypersensitivity in response to exposures to agents such as ultraviolet or ionising radiation, and are characterised by a defective processing of DNA damage. They highlight the importance of the individual capacity of restoring the genomic integrity in the individual risk associated to exposures. The comet assay, a simple technique that detects DNA strand breaks, requires few cells and allows examination of DNA repair capacities in established cell lines, in blood samples or biopsies. The assay has been validated on cellular systems with known repair defects such as xeroderma pigmentosum defective in nucleotide excision repair, on mutant rodent cell lines defective in DNA single strand break rejoining (XRCC1) (alkaline version) or DNA double strand breaks rejoining (XRCC5\/Ku80 and XRCC7\/DNAPKcs) (neutral conditions). This assay does not allow to distinguish a defective phenotype in ataxia telangiectasia cells. It shows in homozygous mouse embryo fibroblasts Brca2-\/- an impaired DNA double strand break rejoining. Simplicity, rapidity and sensitivity of the alkaline comet assay allow to examine the response of lymphocytes. It has been applied to the analysis of the role of DNA repair in the pathogenesis of collagen diseases, and the involvement of individual DNA repair proficiency in the thyroid tumorigenesis induced in some patients after therapeutic irradiation at childhood has been questioned. Preliminary results of these studies suggest that this type of approach could help for adapting treatment modalities and surveillance in subgroups of patients defective in DNA repair process. It could also have some incidence in the radioprotection field.","2407":"Various assays measuring tumor radiosensitivity were developed in the early eighties. These assays were based on cell cultures derived from tumor biopsies. In most studies there was no correlation between measured radiosensitivity and treatment outcome. New assays using new techniques (such as measurement of radiation-induced apoptosis, or fluorescence in situ hybridization) have been developed recently. Preliminary results are encouraging, but correlation with treatment outcome is expected to be difficult to demonstrate as multivarious clinical and biological parameters are involved in loco-regional control.","2408":"This text is intended to introduce the following articles, which correspond to the lectures given at the \"Radiosensitivity\" session of the 1998 SFRO Meeting. We first underline the somewhat disappointing results obtained so far for evaluating tumoral radiosensitivity. However, a few new tests could bring some hope in a not-too distant future. We then focus on individual radiosensitivity. We first list the syndromes or diseases associated with a known hyperradiosensitivity. We then concentrate on the radiosensitivity tests that are available in 1998, some of them being already used in a few centers in specific situations. However, the \"optimal\" test is still to be identified. After a brief chapter on the possible modulations of radiosensitivity, we conclude with a few recommendations to the clinician.","2409":"Since 1985, the gold standard regimen for metastatic tumours of the urothelial tract is a combination of methotrexate, vinblastine, doxorubicin and cisplatin (M-VAC protocol). Randomised studies have shown the superiority of the M-VAC regimen over cisplatin alone or in combination with cyclophosphamide and doxorubicin. The limited gain in survival shows that, although chemosensitive, metastatic tumours cannot be cured by the available drug combinations. Amongst new cytotoxic drugs in development, paclitaxel and gemcitabine are likely to be involved in the standard regimen of the future. The studies published to date do not support the routine use of chemotherapy in the neo-adjuvant or adjuvant setting for the management of early stage urothelial tumours.","2410":"The role of radical cystectomy as the standard treatment of localised infiltrating bladder malignancy is challenged by the development radiotherapy and chemotherapy combinations. The published studies are difficult to compare because of large differences in the patients selection criteria and in the assessment of local involvement (only clinical in combined treatment, based on pathology and therefore unquestionable in surgical series). The advantages of radical surgery are its precedence and a well-established technique, simplified follow-up procedures and seemingly higher survival rates acquired after 3 years. Conversely, the combination of radiotherapy and chemotherapy allows bladder preservation in about 40% of the patients (at 5 years), but only in 23% without bladder relapses. A complete initial endoscopic resection is the best and only prognostic factor of these results which nevertheless needs a very carefully and endless follows. The comparison of the quality of life achieved by both treatment modalities remains insufficiently documented.","2411":"Retrospective analysis of result of radical cystectomy at Cochin Hospital. We report the results of a 106 patients series treated by radical cystectomy for bladder carcinoma after a 5-year period follow-up. The extent of the tumour invasion according to pathological analysis was: pT1 or less: 26%, pT2 and pT3a: 33%, pT3b and over: 41%. Morbidity rate was 19% with a 7.5% reintervention rate. Long term complication rate was 31%, concerning essentially ureteral stenosis. A local recurrence or distant metastasis occurred in 35% of patients. Local recurrence rate was 10.7%. Cancer specific survival rates were 88%, 81% and 42% for pT1, pT2-pT3a, and pT3b patients respectively. The present results confirm that radical cystectomy is the most effective curative treatment for invasive bladder carcinoma. ","2412":"Therapeutic strategies for muscle invasive bladder cancer are currently evolving. Transurethral surgery followed by concurrent chemotherapy and radiotherapy is the best treatment for patients not suitable for radical cystectomy. This conservative approach may be proposed for operable patients with similar survival than after cystectomy. Intermediate evaluation of response is necessary, as response is the more discriminant prognostic factor for local control. Non responders would be assigned for immediate cystectomy. Morbidity and results of salvage cystectomy are poorly evaluated and probably depending from time from initial treatment and dose of radiation.","2413":"In France, invasive bladder cancer is the most frequent urologic malignancy after prostate carcinoma. The standard treatment of bladder cancer is radical cystectomy. New therapeutic approaches such as chemoradiation combination for a conservative procedure, neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy are still in development. In this prospect, a rigorous selection of patients is needed. This selection is based on prognostic criteria which could be divided into four groups: 1) the volume of the tumour including the tumour infiltration depth, the nodal status, the presence or not of hydronephrosis and the residual tumour burden after transuretral resection; 2) the histologic aspects including histologic grading, the presence or not of an epidermoid metaplasia, of in situ carcinoma or of thrombi; 3) the expression of circulating tumour cell biological markers; 4) the biologic characteristics of the tumour such as ploidy, presence of cytogenetic abnormalities, expression of Ki67, expression of oncogenes or tumour suppressor genes, expression of telomerase, expression of tumour antigens or growth factor receptors. This paper reviews the prognostic value of these different parameters.","2414":"The need for a systematic axillary clearance in breast cancer is presently under question. Alternative methods include the omission of node biopsy in very small tumours and lymphadenectomy limited to the sentinel node. This article discusses the current procedures in axillary surgery in 1998, with information concerning the relationships between the tumour characteristics and the probability of nodal involvement, the new surgical techniques aiming at reducing morbidity, with special emphasis on sentinel node biopsy, and the therapeutic protocols presently being used at the Institut Curie.","2415":"In breast cancer postoperative radiation therapy improves local control rate and survival. When chemotherapy and radiation are indicated, the sequencing of the two treatments is still controversial. Several studies have suggested that adjuvant radiotherapy could be safely delayed until adjuvant chemotherapy was completed. Other studies, most of them retrospective, pointed out that a delay in the initiation of radiotherapy in order to give chemotherapy first may result in an increased rate of local recurrence. Concomitant administration of the two treatments is an attractive alternative. Pilot studies have demonstrated its feasibility. A randomised phase III trial is presently in progress, comparing sequential treatment with chemotherapy first followed by irradiation and radiation versus concomitant treatment. Four-hundred and five patients have been included in 24 months. Toxicity and compliance to the treatment are reported in this evaluation.","2416":"To determine the risk factors for local and distant failure in node-negative breast cancer treated with breast-conservative surgery and radiotherapy and to determine the relationship between these two events. We retrospectively selected 908 patients who received conservative surgery and radiotherapy but no chemotherapy between 1980 and 1995, for a node-negative breast cancer. Patients were divided in two groups according to the status of the margins of resection. All pathology specimens were reviewed. In case of negative margins, the risk factors for local recurrences picked up by the Cox model were histologic multifocality (P = 0.0076), peritumoral vessel invasion (P = 0.021) and age &lt; or = 40 years (P = 0.024), and in case of involved margins, negative oestrogen receptors (P = 0.0012), histologic multifocality (P = 0.0028), and absence of hormonal therapy (P = 0.017). The 10-year local recurrence rate was 18% in case of negative margins and 29% in case of involved margins, although in the latter case patients received high-dose adjuvant radiotherapy. Accordingly, the 10-year distant failure rates were 16% and 27%, respectively. Many arguments suggest that local and distant failures are closely related. Patients with histologic multifocality or positive margins are at high risk of local failure and then of distant failure, and require a more aggressive initial treatment. ","2417":"Locoregional control is a crucial step in the achievement of breast cancer cure. In ductal carcinoma in situ, breast irradiation significantly reduces the rates of local recurrence whatever the histological subtypes, as demonstrated by the NSABP-B17 trial (25.8% of local recurrences without radiotherapy vs. 11.4% with radiotherapy). In infiltrating breast carcinomas, complementary breast irradiation has been shown to significantly improve the local control and slightly the overall survival in five randomized trials. Following mastectomy, locoregional irradiation clearly reduces the chest wall and nodal relapse rates, especially in case of lesions more than 5 cm or with nodal involvement and\/or large lymphatic or vascular emboli. Two recent randomized trials confirmed the benefit of well-adapted locoregional irradiation in all subgroups, especially in patients with one to three axillary involved nodes. In the Danish trial (including premenopausal high-risk women), radiotherapy reduced locoregional relapses from 32 to 9% (p &lt; 0.001) and increased the 10-year survival rate from 45 to 54% (p &lt; 0.001). In the Canadian trial, locoregional relapse rate decreased from 25 to 13% and the 10-year survival rate increased from 56 to 65%. The meta-analysis published in 1995 by the EBCTCG showed only a modest benefit due to locoregional irradiation in breast cancer. However, when small or old trials were excluded due to imperfect methodology or inadequate irradiation techniques, the benefit of modern radiotherapy became much more evident in a population of 7,840 patients. Locoregional irradiation appears to be able to reduce the risk of metastatic evolution occurring after local or nodal relapse and must be integrated in a multidisciplinary strategy. Treatment toxicity (especially toxicity due to irradiation of internal mammary nodes) is of special concern, as anthracycline-based chemotherapy is prescribed more often. The use of a direct field, with at least 60% of the dose delivered by electrons alternating with photons is recommended to protect the heart and lungs.","2418":"The conservation of a functional larynx is an important goal in the various attempts to improve the treatment of locally-advanced pharyngo-laryngeal cancers. Several axes have been followed: conservative surgery (subtotal laryngectomy), exclusive irradiation (with conventional or non-conventional fractionation), initial chemotherapy (followed by surgery or irradiation) or concomitant chemotherapy-radiotherapy. The numerous studies, including some major randomised trials, dealing with the issue of larynx preservation are reviewed in the present article. A critical comparison of their results and its integration in a consistent approach are difficult, especially because the different options are aimed at different patients. Total laryngectomy and its psychological and social consequences can be avoided in a significant number of patients, although the long term functional outcome is poorly known and the choice of the optimal treatment modality is largely dependent on the expertise and experience of the medical team.","2419":"","2420":null,"2421":"In external radiotherapy, the use of intensity modulated fields has been proposed for tissue and non-homogeneity compensation or for the generation of conformal dose distributions. Multileaf collimators can be employed dynamically for the modulation of the X-ray field in two dimensions. Efficient dynamic collimation became possible due to advances in computer and linear accelerator technology. It presents a number of advantages over conventional methods such as the use of compensators. We have developed a program which calculates, from a given intensity distribution, the motion of the MLC leaves as a function of monitor units, and we have applied it on a Varian linear accelerator with a 40 pair multileaf collimator. The analysis of the experimental results demonstrates the feasibility and the potential of the method.","2422":"Ollier's disease is a rate affliction (not more than approximately 100 cases have been reported over a 30-year period) characterized by bone dysplasia in which evolution to degenerative neoplasia has been described. Diagnosis of chondrosarcoma is delicate in these cases. It is a kind of slowly evolving low grade malignant tumor. Surgery is the primary treatment course, and can lead to remission. Prognosis, depending on the number and dimension of the lesions, their localization and metastasis prevention, is usually good, but relapses are relatively frequent: 25 to 50%. In case of relapse, radiotherapy and chemotherapy were tested but their efficacy is limited. We report here two clinical cases and discuss literature data.","2423":"Retrospective analysis of eight new cases of radiation-induced sarcomas following radiotherapy for breast carcinoma and literature review. Eleven patients presenting with radiation-induced sarcoma after radiotherapy for breast cancer have been treated between 1983 and 1997 at Henri Mondor University Hospital (France). Eight of these patients respected the criteria established by Cahan et al. The others had Stewart-Treves Syndrome and were thus excluded from the analysis. Only one of the eight patients had received chemotherapy. All of the patients at the time of diagnosis of radiation-induced sarcoma were free of breast cancer recurrence. Radiation-induced sarcoma appeared with a latency period of 5 to 18 years (mean: 10.3 years). Patients' ages ranged from 39 to 88 years (mean: 57.6 years) at the time of diagnosis of sarcoma. Three sarcomas occurred in the treated breast, two in the chest wall, one in the preclavicular area and two in the axillary region. There were two angiosarcomas, three fibrosarcomas, one osteosarcoma, one malignant fibrous histiocytoma (MFH), and one undifferentiated sarcoma. All patients have received treatment for their sarcoma: all of them underwent surgery, one patient combined radiotherapy and chemotherapy, and three patients chemotherapy. Two patients were alive and free from disease. Six patients died (5-34 months); all six had local and\/or metastatic recurrence. Radiotherapy can induce malignancies after a latent period of several years. Radiation-induced sarcomas are associated with poor overall prognosis. The treatment in most of the cases is late and ineffective, therefore careful follow-up is needed. There are still many uncertainties and questions about radiation-induced sarcomas. ","2424":"To evaluate the usefulness of radiosurgery without whole brain irradiation for a solitary brain metastasis. Between December 1994 and November 1996, 12 patients were treated for a single brain metastasis by radiosurgery alone. Median age was 53, and 10 patients had a Karnofsky performance status above 70. Half the patients had active extracranial disease at the time of radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery delivered a single dose of 20 Gy (specified at the isocenter with a 70% isodose reference curve). Evaluation of results was performed according to local control, survival, evolution of performance status, as well as evolution of neurologic symptoms. No patient had immediate toxicity. One month later, ten patients showed improvement in their neurologic impairments, and none had progression of the cerebral lesion according to CT scan evaluation (diminution for seven patients, and stabilization for five). Local control rate was 58%, and median time to failure was 4 months. The overall median survival time was 10 months. Three patients were alive, with good performance status, and six died following cerebral progression. These poor results in terms of local control are in favor of supplementary whole brain irradiation, except for particular cases. ","2425":"In a retrospective analysis, our aim was to evaluate the immediate tolerance and the early and late complications of abdomino-pelvic radiotherapy in the Centre Alexis-Vautrin (France). From 1st January 1983 to 31st December 1993, 117 patients were treated at Centre Alexis Vautrin in Nancy for epithelial ovarian cancer by abdominal and\/or pelvic irradiation after surgery. They were aged from 24 to 85 with a median of 56 years. There were ten patients with stage I (9%), 28 patients with stage II (24%), 60 patients with stage III (61%) and 19 patients with stage IV (16%) disease. Results of surgery were determined as follows: satisfactory with absence of tumoral residuum in 26% cases (30 patients) and with residuum inferior to 20 mm in 46% cases (52 patients; incomplete in 26% cases (31 patients) either because of residuum superior in 20 mm and\/or incomplete surgery; and not evaluable in 3% cases (four patients). Seventy-seven patients were sent to the Centre for postoperative treatment (66% patients of the series), 48 of them (62.4%) after non-satisfactory surgery, 29 after satisfactory surgery (37.6%). Chemotherapy was administered to only 104 patients (89% cases), and contained platinum salts and cyclophosphamid for 87% of these patients. Fourteen patients (12%) received a single irradiation dose after surgery: three in stage I, three with poor evaluation of the disease in the initial stage, three with medical contraindications to chemotherapy treatment, six with contraindications due to advanced age (?? Makes 15 ). Histologically, 46% of patients had a serous adenocarcinoma, 9% a mucinous adenocarcinoma, 11% an endometrioid adenocarcinoma, 2% a clear cell adenocarcinoma, 1% an undifferentiated adenocarcinoma, and 31% an epithelial carcinoma without any other indication. The histological grade which was recently introduced was rarely indicated. Complementary radiotherapeutic treatment consisted of pelvic irradiation for 14 patients (12%), abdomino-pelvic irradiation for 63 patients (54%), and total abdominal irradiation with a pelvic boost for 40 patients (34%). The immediate tolerance to irradiation can be considered as globally satisfactory since 9% of the patients (ten cases) had no problems and 64% of the patients developed a minor intolerance easily controlled by symptomatic treatments. There were also digestive complications: nausea, vomiting and diarrhea for 66% of the patients (50 cases); to a lesser extent, 20% of the cases experienced associated digestive and hematological complications (15 patients); 9% isolated hematological troubles such as anemia (seven patients); 4% digestive complications (three patients) and 1% hematological and urinary digestive troubles (one patients). Late irradiation sequelae were evaluated for 89 patients with a follow-up lasting from 4 months to 11 years. Sixty-six patients had no sequelae, eleven patients had minor tolerability problems--mainly digestive for more than half of them. Five patients presented severe complications, including hematological problems such as chronic thrombopenia in two cases, urinary-problems in two other cases, and one patient presented with a case of histologically proven malabsorption. Two patients presented major problems; one case of radic cystitis and one of radic bowel. Two patients died of iatrogenic causes: one of induced leukemia, the other of treatment-induced digestive and renal complications. The overall survival rate was 30% at 5 years and 22% at 10 years. It was 90% at 5 and 10 years for stage I patients, 60% at 5 years and 30% at 10 years for stage II patients, 22% at 5 years and 8% at 10 years for stage III patients, and finally 10% at 5 years for stage IV patients. In this retrospective analysis of 117 epithelial ovarian cancers, treated over 10 years and which all received pelvic and\/or abdominal irradiation, we can conclude that this treatment is globally well tolerated and that it yields a ","2426":"To evaluate a ionization chamber on-line portal imaging system in routine clinical radiotherapy of rectum cancers. Megavolt portal images were obtained using a fast electronic megavoltage radiotherapy imaging system in 13 cases of pelvic fields. A total of 208 portal images and 13 simulator films were used to determine the values of set-up deviations in the X-Z-directions of a fixed co-ordinate system, and of the rotation fields (R). Mean standard deviations of the difference between simulation and treatment images were 3.2 mm and 0.9 mm for X and Z, 3.6 mm for the rotation fault. The standard deviations were, respectively, 7.1 mm, 7.1 mm and 1.5 mm. The cumulative frequency distributions revealed that 80% and 95% of the absolute differences were less than 10 mm and 17.5 mm, respectively. These results indicate the difficulty of a reproducible daily set-up. A weekly control could be proposed in order to increase the quality of pelvic site treatment. The introduction of masks to improve the set-up is also discussed. ","2427":"This retrospective study aims to define the effects of different radiation dose levels on survival, local control and toxicity in a series of 208 patients with localised prostate cancer consecutively treated with radical radiation therapy. From 1982 through 1996, 365 patients with prostate cancer have been consecutively treated with radical radiotherapy in Florence (n = 306) and Arezzo (n = 59). The 208 cases treated until January 1994 with Stage B (125\/208, 60%) and C (83\/208, 40%) are the objects of the present study. The treatment was most often limited to the prostatic area (81%), using a four-field \"box technique\" and 25 MV photon beams, up to a total dose of 60-65 Gy (21% of the patients), of 66-69 Gy (26%) and of 70 Gy (53%); conventional fractionation was used (fractional dose: 2 Gy; five fractions\/week). Hormonal therapy was also given to 39% of the cases. The possible relationship between dose, stage, grading and survival has been analysed. The survival figures and the types of relapse observed (prostatic, lymphnodal or \"biochemical\") have been analysed also according to the extent of the target volume and to the prostate-specific antigen (PSA) value at diagnosis, in the entire series or in selected subgroups. In the whole series and also after radiation alone, the patients with Stage B, with more differentiated tumours and those treated with higher doses to the prostate obtained significantly better survival results. Multivariate analysis confirmed that the dose level has an independent prognostic value. The use of a limited target volume did not produce an excess of pelvic lymphnodal failures. Among the patients more recently treated with radiation alone, the PSA level at diagnosis is strongly related with the risk of local and \"biochemical\" failure, and also with the relapse-free survival. Toxicity was acceptable, also for the patients treated with higher doses, but late treatment-related damage is more frequent in patients treated on larger volumes. The results of this retrospective analysis confirm the good results of small volume, high dose radiation therapy of prostatic cancer, even taking into account the possible biases due to the retrospective nature of the study, and the relevance of the PSA level at diagnosis to define the risk of local failure. ","2428":"Retrospective analysis of the results of radiotherapy in localized prostatic adenocarcinoma. Complications were excluded. Six-hundred-and-ten T1-T2 adenocarcinomas of the prostate were treated with continuous courses of external beam radiation therapy in 19 participating Institutes between January 1983 and January 1988. The mean follow-up was 10.4 years; the mean age of patients at the beginning of radiotherapy was 68.5 years. A 10-year, local control had been achieved in 86% of T1-T2 (81.4% for T2). The 5- and 10-year metastatic relapse rates were 25.3% and 30% (29% and 38.1% for T2), respectively. At 10 years, 62.4% of T1-T2 were recurrence-free; overall survival rate was 45.8% and cause-specific survival rate was 70.5%; 29.9% of T1-T2 patients were alive and disease-free. T category (TNM), pathologic grade, pelvic lymph node status, local tumor control, and obstructive ureteral symptoms were correlated with survival. The influence of pelvic nodes radiation, dose, overall treatment time, previous endocrine treatment, and transuretral resection was not significant for disease-free survival (alive and disease-free) and other endpoints. There was no difference between the French series (1975-1982 and 1983-1988). The results of the literature are comparable to ours. As far as prognostic factors are concerned, this report provides evidence that the explainable variables which influence survival depend on the tumor and patient status. ","2429":"About 30% of patients who underwent percutaneous transluminal coronary angioplasty show evidence of restenosis, which appears to be independent of the angioplasty method used. The restenosis is due of two factors, firstly migration of smooth vascular muscle cells of the vascular media to the intima and multiplication which lead to the formation of a neo-intima. Irradiation limits the proliferation by acting of the cells in the mitotic stage. The vascular target volume is not very thick and is difficult to define it, that why brachytherapy seems to be the best procedure to prevent restenosis. However, the development of this treatment present many difficulties. Different irradiation techniques have been studied. Such techniques include catheter containing radioactive sealed source, radioactive stent, or balloon containing radioactive liquid inside. Each of these methods have their own advantages, inconveniences, problems and risks. Radioisotope may be either beta or gamma emitters. Gamma emitter presents problems for radioprotection but the satisfactory dose distribution may be difficult to obtain using beta emitter. Choice of dose, dose rate and delay between the end of angioplasty and the beginning of brachytherapy is subject to some discuss. Animal experiments using radioisotope have shown reduction in cell proliferation. Human trials showed feasibility, safety of the method and real impact on restenosis prevention. However, long-term efficacy has not been proved because the follow-up of the patients is too short. A randomized trial of 192Ir brachytherapy for prevention of restenosis has recently shown the efficacy in short and median term. However, long term efficiency and secondary effects have not yet been established as the follow up time of this study is still too short. That is why, collaboration between cardiologists and radiotherapists and physicists is indispensable to enable the development of an optimal technique.","2430":"","2431":"","2432":"","2433":"","2434":"A survey questionnaire was sent to the 189 French departments of radiation Oncology and 166 responded by brachytherapy and 358 shielded rooms were available.

Twenty-six departments were equipped with high dose rate after loaders (HDR) all of them also using LDR techniques for most of the patients. A total of 9,160 patients were treated: 7,868 with LDR and 1,292 with HDR. The common sites treated by LDR were uterovaginal (4,300), breast (1,415), head and neck (1,049), skin (610), anorectal (220) and urologic (70). HDR was used for vaginal cuff (628), bronchi (371), oesophagus (232). PDR just started (33 patients) for a feasibility trial.

Between 1986 and 1994, 36 patients with clinical stage A2 (five patients), B1 (12 patients) and B2 (19 patients) N0 adenocarcinoma of the prostate declined for radical surgery, underwent a brief neoadjuvant hormonal therapy before external beam radiotherapy at our radiation therapy department. They all had a PSA determination before the combined treatment and no evidence of local extension or metastatic spread. They were followed clinically and with serial PSA levels for a median time of 58 months. Relapse was defined by a PSA level &gt; or = 2.5 ng\/mL. Median pre-treatment PSA level was 16.5 ng\/mL; 16 patients had less than 15 ng\/mL. Combined treatment was very well tolerated. After 3 months of neoadjuvant hormonetherapy, digital rectal examination was normalized in 27 cases with a PSA value &lt; or = 1 ng\/mL in 23. Only four tumors have relapsed (one local failure, two metastases and one PSA failure). The single factor that predicted biochemical relapse was pre-treatment PSA level: the 5-year actuarial rate of PSA failure when PSA level &lt; 15 ng\/mL was 0% and 27.5% if it was &gt; or = 15 ng\/mL (p = 0.05).

","2438":"Retrospective analysis of the influence of clinical and technical factors on local control and survival after radiosurgery for brain metastasis. From January 1994 to December 1996, 42 patients presenting with 71 metastases underwent radiosurgery for brain metastasis. The median age was 56 years and the median Karnofsky index 80. Primary sites included: lung (20 patients), kidney (seven), breast (five), colon (two), melanoma (three), osteosarcoma (one) and it was unknown for three patients. Seventeen patients had extracranial metastasis. Twenty-four patients were treated at recurrence which occurred after whole brain irradiation (12 patients), surgical excision (four) or after both treatments (eight). Thirty-six sessions of radiosurgery have been realized for one metastasis and 13 for two, three or four lesions. The median metastasis diameter was 21 mm and the median volume 1.7 cm3. The median peripheral dose to the lesion was 14 Gy, and the median dose at the isocenter 20 Gy. Sixty-five metastases were evaluable for response analysis. The overall local control rate was 82% and the 1-year actuarial rate was 72%. In univariate analysis, theoretical radioresistance (P = 0.001), diameter less than 3 cm (P = 0.039) and initial treatment with radiosurgery (P = 0.041) were significantly associated with increased local control. Only the first two factors remained significant in multivariate analysis. No prognostic factor of overall survival was identified. The median survival was 12 months. Six patients had a symptomatic oedema (RTOG grade 2), only one of which requiring a surgical excision. In conclusion, 14 Gy delivered at the periphery of metastasis seems to be a sufficient dose to control most brain metastases, with a minimal toxicity. Better results were obtained for lesions initially treated with radiosurgery, theoretically radioresistant and with a diameter less than 3 cm. ","2439":"In patients with early cervix carcinoma, both radiotherapy and surgery or combined modalities provide effective therapies. In the two last modalities, recommended surgery is radical hysterectomy. The purpose of this prospective study was to assess the value of a limited vaginal hysterectomy after brachytherapy in patients without any unfavorable prognostic factor. Twenty-two patients (stage Ia2 with vascular invasion: three patients, stage Ib 1:19 patients) with 1 cm median maximal tumor size and with previous negative laparoscopic lymphadenectomy (median number of lymph nodes: 12) underwent a limited vaginal hysterectomy 6 weeks after utero-vaginal brachytherapy. Two mild intra-operative complications were noted. Venous hemorrhage (100 mL) occurred in one patient during lymphadenectomy and another patient presented bladder injury during hysterectomy. These two complications were successfully controlled with no need for laparotomy. Only one late complication was observed: bladder grade G2 (b). With a 29 months follow-up (20-48 months), no recurrence was reported. These results appear promising in patients with very early cervix carcinoma but remain to be confirmed on a larger scale.

Between 1992 and 1995, 38 patients (median age: 60) were treated for locally advanced resectable rectal cancer. Median dose of radiotherapy was 45 Gy\/25 fractions\/5 weeks. Chemotherapy consisted of two courses of 5-fluorouracil and leucovorin administered during the first and the fifth weeks of radiotherapy. Median dose of 5-fluorouracil was 350 mg\/m2\/day, and median dose of leucovorin was 20 mg\/m2\/day, day 1 to day 5. Surgery was performed 5 weeks after completion of radiotherapy. Before surgery, one patient died of febrile neutropenia and sepsis after two cycles of chemotherapy and 45 Gy. Main pre-operative grade 3-4 toxicities were respectively: neutropenia: 3%; nausea\/vomiting: 3%; diarrhea: 3%; proctitis: 5%; radiation dermatitis: 8%. Twenty-six patients underwent a low anterior resection and 11 an abdomino-perineal resection. A temporary colostomy was performed in 12 patients. Pathologic complete response rate was 27%. There was one post-operative death due to thromboembolic disease. Major post-operative grade 3-4 complications were: pelvic infection: 14%; abdominal infection: 5%; perineal sepsis: 8%; anastomotic dehiscence: 8%; cardiac failure: 5%. Delayed perineal wound healing was observed in six patients. No significant prognosic factor of post-operative complications has been observed. Median duration of hospitalization was 22 days. With a median follow-up of 24 months, 2-year overall and disease-free survival rates were 82 and 64%. Tolerance of preoperative concurrent chemoradiotherapy was acceptable. Ongoing controlled studies will assess the impact of this combined treatment on survival. ","2441":"The role of postoperative irradiation for lung cancer remains a controversial issue. The available data suggest a reduction in local relapse in cases of positive mediastinal lymph node, but how this benefit translates into survival is not known. The current indications include tumors with positive mediastinal lymph node and incomplete resection with micro- or macroscopical residue. Nevertheless, postoperative irradiation requires a meticulous technique to avoid inducing life-threatening complications to vital organs such as the heart or the lung.","2442":"The choice of dose and fractionation for total body irradiation is made difficult by the large number of considerations to be taken into account. The outcome of bone marrow transplantation after total body irradiation can be understood in terms of tumour cell killing, engraftment, and normal tissue damage, each of these endpoints being influenced by irradiation-, disease-, transplant-, and patient-related factors. Interpretation of clinical data is further hampered by the overwhelming influence of logistic constraints, the small numbers of randomised studies, and the concomitant variations in total dose and fraction size or dose rate. So far, three cautious conclusions can be drawn in order to tentatively adapt the total body irradiation schedule to clinically-relevant situations. Firstly, the organs at risk for normal tissue damage (lung, liver, lens, kidney) are protected by delivering small doses per fraction at low dose rate. This suggests that, when toxicity is at stake (e.g., in children), fractionated irradiation should be preferred, provided that interfraction intervals are long enough. Secondly, fractionated irradiation should be avoided in case of T-cell depleted transplant, given the high risk of graft rejection in this setting. An alternative would be to increase total (or fractional) dose of fractionated total body irradiation, but this approach is likely to induce more normal tissue toxicity. Thirdly, clinical data have shown higher relapse rates in chronic myeloid leukaemia after fractionated or low dose rate total body irradiation, suggesting that fractionated irradiation should not be recommended, unless total (or fractional) dose is increased. Total body irradiation-containing regimens, primarily cyclophosphamide\/total body irradiation, are either equivalent to or better than the chemotherapy-only regimens, primarily busulfan\/cyclophosphamide. Busulfan\/cyclophosphamide certainly represents a reasonable alternative, especially in patients who may not be eligible for total body irradiation because of prior irradiation to critical organs.","2443":null,"2444":"During the last decade, stereotactic radiotherapy has widely improved in France. Thus one should study the present situation and its future trend. QUANTITATIVE NEED: Considering single dose radiotherapy, there are about 900 to 1,000 cases treated per year. However, the trend towards more fractionated treatment will disturb this temporary equilibrium; thus more machine time will be necessary. QUALITATIVE NEED: Stereotactic radiotherapy is practiced by multi-disciplinary teams including physicians, physicists and scientific specialists. Radiotherapists and physicist are responsible for treatment planning and evaluation as well as for clinical and methodological research. Accordingly, they should possess computers, treatment planning systems, etc. Such teams are necessary to carry out complex irradiations. GENERAL EVOLUTION: Fractionation of irradiation nowadays seems mandatory for most intracranial tumors except metastases and small regular arteriovenous malformations. Heterogeneity of lesion dose is related to the geometry and the physics of convergent fixed or mobile beams. It can be improved and the healthy tissue irradiation can be diminished using the multi-isocentric planning for complex lesion or with micro multi leaf collimators. MODALITIES OF STEREOTACTIC RADIOTHERAPY ACCORDING TO LESION TYPE: For neurinomas of the acoustic nerve, fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy yields few of the complications published after single dose stereotactic radiotherapy. The same can be said for meningiomas although some series reported very few complications after single dose stereotactic radiotherapy. Solitary metastases without systemic evolution, not situated on the mid-line, are favorable candidates for palliative single dose stereotactic radiotherapy. The conjunction with total brain irradiation seems to be useful. Small arteriovenous malformations will be treated with single dose stereotactic radiotherapy, whereas voluminous and\/or geometrically complex nidus could benefit from protons or photon beams modulated by micro multi leaf collimators and a few fractions. EXTRA-CRANIAL STEREOTACTIC RADIOTHERAPY: Single dose stereotactic radiotherapy and fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy will be used as boost in various situations such as massif facial and in all sorts of tumors in the body specially when lesions are close to critical organs.","2445":"Stereotactic radiosurgery, a term introduced by Leksell, was born more than 40 years ago, but has made great strides for the last 15 years. There is no consensus among neurosurgeons as to the best device (gamma knife, linear accelerator), the treatment doses, and the clinical indications of stereotactic radiosurgery. Therefore, this report is the viewpoint of one neurosurgical team only. In the radiosurgery literature, there is no clear evidence of better results with the gamma-knife or the linear accelerators. With regard to clinical applications, cerebral arteriovenous malformations are the more widely accepted indications of radiosurgery, since a cerebral angiography can confirm the disappearance of the nidus of an arteriovenous malformation treated by stereotactic radiosurgery. Usually, small and deep arteriovenous malformations can be treated by stereotactic radiosurgery only. Nevertheless, the treatment of the other arteriovenous malformations more often require procedures including one or several of the following treatment methods: microneurosurgery, interventional neuradiology, stereotactic radiosurgery. Stereotactic radiosurgery in acoustic schwannomas, skull base meningiomas, especially those involving the cavernous sinus, brain metastases, and pituitary tumors seem attractive. Contrary to arteriovenous malformations, the lack of criteria for cure requires a long follow-up and carefully controlled trials to confirm the efficiency of stereotactic radiosurgery for these tumors. On the other hand, experience of stereotactic radiosurgery for astrocytomas and glioblastomas is limited, and few publications are available. Furthermore, because of the infiltrating growth, a major impact of stereotactic radiosurgery for these tumors is presumably not to be expected. Lastly, a close multidisciplinary approach seems absolutely necessary to define the best indications of stereotactic radiosurgery and to improve its clinical results.","2446":null,"2447":"We have looked for trials which are in progress in the field of stereotactic radiotherapy (radiosurgery) of malignant brain tumors.

Results of a retrospective and multicentric analysis are presented. Fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy uses the ballistic principles of the radiosurgery: stereotactic localization, multi-beam irradiation, secondary collimation, three-dimensional dosimetry. Standard fractionation is possible with a re-locatable non-invasive stereotactic device. The technique has been used for treating pituitary adenomas (86 patients), acoustic neuromas (32 patients) and cavernous meningiomas (26 patients). 1) pituitary adenomas: cumulative tumoral objective-response rates (42 patients) were respectively 42%, 69% and 88% at 24, 48 and 60 months. The cumulative endocrinologic objective-response rates (32 patients) were respectively 53%, 75% and 85% at 24, 48 and 60 months. The cumulative risk of radio-induced hormonal deficiency varied from 18% (growth hormone [GH]) to 42% for TSH (thyroid stimulating hormone) at 48 months. No other complication was observed; 2) acoustic neuromas: 33 tumors, &lt; 25 mm in diameter, were treated in 32 patients. Tumor control was observed in 29\/33 tumors: 14 were stable, 15 decreased and three progressed. Useful hearing was maintained in 9\/10 patients. Only three patients (9%) presented persistent complications; 3) cavernous meningioma: 17\/19 clinical responses were noted, 20 tumoral stabilisations, one partial response and one progression (22 magnetic resonance imaging [MRI] evaluable patients). One unilateral radio-induced blindness was observed. For these benign tumors, the focused target volume obtained by the fractionated stereotactic radiotherapy seems to be better adapted to the treatment of limited benign tumors than standard radiotherapy. The use of standard fractionation reduces the risk of severe normal tissue damage, sometimes observed for radiosurgery and inherent in the use of single fraction. ","2449":"Radiosurgery has recently provided an alternative to conventional therapy for the treatment of brain metastases. This non-invasive technique delivers a single large fraction of ionizing radiation to a well-defined small intracranial target as brain metastases. After a computerized tomography (CT) with stereotactic frame in place for tumor localization, a dosimetric study was performed. The sharp dose gradient of radiation reduces the dose to the surrounding normal structures at a minimal level (&gt; 10%). The prescribed dose at the periphery of the lesion varies from 8 to 27 Gy with a combined whole brain irradiation and from 20 to 35 Gy without any irradiation. Radiosurgery has been reported to be highly efficacious with a local control rate of 86% (not increased size without local recurrence). Brain metastases from melanoma and renal carcinoma are usually resistant to conventional irradiation and are highly sensitive with this technique. The morbidity is very low with a symptomatic edema rate of 5-10% at 2 years, resolved with corticosteroids. A radiation necrosis has been reported in less than 5% of cases. The patients with a good performance status, without any extracranial metastasis and with a solitary brain metastases have presented the best survival rate. New brain metastases have occurred in 20 to 30% of the cases during the follow-up. Eleven to 25% of patients died from their intracranial disease and the others from the extracranial evolution of the cancer. The median survival was still poor, ranging from 8 to 12 months. Radiosurgery is a good choice for surgically inaccessible and recurrent tumors. It represents an alternative to the neurosurgery with or without whole brain irradiation, taking into account different prognostic factors and morbidity rate. The local control and the survival rates without neurologic symptom should be considered the major endpoints of different ongoing randomized studies for evaluating the role of the radiosurgery.","2450":"Microsurgical excision is the reference treatment of vestibular schwannomas. Yet, morbidity and functional risk of this surgery is significant, as Pellet et al have demonstrated in their study. In order to define the role of gamma knife surgery we have designed a prospective study concerning effectiveness and tolerance of this treatment. Between July 14, 1992 and August, 1997, 400 patients were included. All the treatments were carried out according to a homogeneous methodology, with multiisocentric planning. We use low marginal doses dependent mainly on the treatment volume: 14 Gy for small stade II tumors, 12 Gy or less for larger tumors and 16 Gy for intracanalicular tumors. The evaluation protocol included preoperative examination with clinical examination, House grading, Shirmer's test, tonal and vocal audiometry, brain stem electrical response audiometry (BERA), vestibular caloric and pendular tests, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) or computerized tomography (CT) scan; control at 6 months, 1 year and 2 years with clinical examination, tonal audiometry and MRI and\/or CT scan; at 3 years the preoperative examination was repeated and a questionnaire based on Pellet's concerning functional results was completed. Among the 400 treatments, 80% were first intended treatment of unilateral vestibular schwannoma. At the time of the analysis, 100 consecutive patients with unilateral schwannoma (treated in first intention) had a 3 year follow-up (results concerned these 100 patients). Average age was 61 years (17-82 years). According to Portmann's classification, five patients presented a stade 1 tumor, 60 a stade 2 tumor, 33 a stade 3, and two a stade 4 tumor. According to House's grading at preoperative examination, there was 86 (86%) grade 1 tumors, 12 grade 2, two grade 3, and at 3 year follow-up: 77 (94%) grade 1 and five grade 2 (17 patients had no House grading). At preoperative examination, three patients presented an hemispasm; at 3 years this had disappeared for all patients. Two others patients presented a transient hemispasm at 8 and 11 months, respectively. At preoperative examination, four patients presented with facial numbness and 14 with hypoesthesia. At 3 year follow-up, trigeminal function was normal for all patients but one, for whom this had only improved. Seven others patients presented a transient numbness or hypoesthesia. At preoperative examination, five patients presented hydrocephalus without cerebro spinal fluid (CSF) shunting. At 3 year follow-up, seven patients presented CSF shunting: three presented a preoperative hydrocephalus, three a hydrocephalus after treatment and one a hydrocephalus secondary to tumor growth. Average age for these six patients was 71 years. Audiological classification was based on Gardner-Robertson's. Seventy percent of patients with normal hearing maintained useful hearing, and 50% of patients with useful hearing maintained serviceable hearing. Three (3%) patients (two with stade 2 tumors and one with a stade 3) had microsurgical excision at 16, 35 and 36 months, respectively. During microsurgical excision no unusual difficulty was encountered. Seventeen questionnaires investigating functional outcome and quality of life were completed: 100% (63% in Pellet's study) of the patients answered they had no facial motion disturbance, 49% (17% in Pellet's study) had no ocular problems, 20% (in Pellet's study 55%) had subjective trigeminal problems, 8% (in Pellet's study 13%) had deglutition problems, none (16% in Pellet's study) had other eating problems, 91% (61% in Pellet's study) had no change in their life. Mean hospitalization stay was 3 days (for 23 days in Pellet's study). All the patients who worked, except one, had the same professional activity (66% in Pellet's study).

Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) provides morphological data, size and topography of the nidus, anatomic relationship, as well as dynamic information particularly with the use of MR angiography.

Annual incidence of radiosurgery for AVM can be estimated to 5 per million inhabitants per year in France. First therapeutic results of AVM series are described.","2454":"The development of non-invasive head fixation systems, allowing 3D determination of the target coordinates, has lead to the increased use of fractionated stereotactic irradiation. These systems have been checked for accuracy and the mean precision of repositioning has been evaluated to +\/- 1 mm. With the mean geometrical accuracy set at +\/- 1 mm, a 2 mm safety margin is usually added to the clinical target volume in order to define the planning target volume. Quality assurance procedures must conform to the required precision of the technique while remaining realistic in day-to-day use relative to planned conventional treatments. Biologically different from single dose irradiation, the fractionated stereotactic irradiation completes the range of techniques used in the treatment of intra-cerebral lesions.","2455":"Stereotactic neurosurgery and stereotactic radiation therapy require the three-dimensional localization of lesions for biopsy or for treatment planning. The aim of this paper is the description of methods used in the different imaging modalities: x-ray teleradiography, digital subtracted angiography, computed tomography, and nuclear magnetic resonance imaging. The simple pin-target locating techniques are distinguished from those serving to the definition of volumes target necessary to treatment planning. Performances and difficulties of these techniques are emphasized. The specific methodology developed in Lille is described as an example. Organizational aspects and necessary quality controls for a good progress of the entire procedure, from imaging to treatment, are also discussed.","2456":"Typical dosimeters used in stereotactic radiation therapy, such as ionization chambers, films, and thermoluminescent diodes, allow basic physical measurements. They are, however, neither well suited to discern small target volumes with high dose gradient, nor suitable for three-dimensional (3D) dose measurements. Gel dosimetry is becoming more and more interesting, owing to magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). It permits isocenter position planning verification of accuracy and the precision of the 3D dose mapping in the brain (when irradiated in realistic conditions), especially when several different targets are concerned. Many authors have assessed stereotactic radiation therapy quality control using different gels, and different irradiation procedures. This paper consists of the review of these different methods to assess quality control. Gel dosimetry cannot provide absolute dose measurements. However, gels can be used to check the 3D dose mapping with a high degree of detail. In our experiment, the difference between the stereotactic frame center and the isocenter is about 1 mm. The difference between the theoretical isodoses obtained by the treatment planning system and the experimental isodoses obtained by the MRI gray level calibration is also about 1 mm, the order of magnitude of the MRI pixel size.","2457":null,"2458":"Stereotactic radiosurgery is a technique for treatment of intracranial lesions requiring high precision in all steps--from image acquisition to final irradiation. One of most difficult steps is the treatment planning phase, consisting of determination of irradiation parameters sufficient to cover the target volume by avoiding sensitive volumes. A manual and empirical definition can be very long and difficult, especially in the case of complex target volumes situated in sensitive zones. As in conventional radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery has taken advantages from dosimetric optimization. The question is: \"What is the configuration of irradiation parameters used in order to obtain the treatment plan by satisfying defined constraints?\". The purpose of this article is to summarize optimization methods used in radiosurgery and to describe the technical alternatives proposed for this treatment as well as the possibilities of plan evaluation between different techniques. This purpose will be illustrated by the optimization methodology used in the Center Oscar Lambret of Lille, France for the radiosurgical treatment with linear accelerator.","2459":"A high performance standard radiotherapy treatment unit could be used to perform stereotactic radiosurgery. The dosimetric aspects of stereotactic irradiation with small size photon beams (energies from 5 to 25 MV produced by electron linear accelerator or gamma-rays produced by cobalt-60 treatment unit) are analyzed. The diameter of circular beams used are 5 to 40 millimeters wide at the isocenter of the treatment unit. The dosimetry of small x-ray fields is complicated by two factors: the relationship between detector size and field size dimensions, and the lack of lateral electron equilibrium. The large dose gradients outside the beam's central axis require dosimetry techniques with higher spatial resolution. To determine the best dosimetry system for measurements at the beam's small focal point, particularly for measurement of the field size dependent on output factors, several different detectors were investigated: ionization chamber, silicon diode, diamond detector, thermoluminescent dosimeter, and film. Ionization chamber, which presents a sensitive volume smaller than 0.02 cm3, is the most commonly recommended detector for field diameter above 8 mm. Current representative examples of dosimetric measurements for different x-ray energies, including percent depth dose, tissue maximum ratios, beam profiles (off axis ratios), and output factors, are presented and discussed.

Great efforts are being made to set up 3D conformal radiotherapy. Consequently, in the aim of greater coherence and accuracy, \"the dosimetric tool\" must also meet the requirements of 3D radiotherapy, as it plays a role in the treatment chain. To know if the treatment planning system is a \"3D\", \"2D\" or even \"1D\" system, one should not be satisfied with reading the technical documentation and the program algorithm description nor entirely trust the constructor's assertions. It is essential to clearly and precisely evaluate the possibilities of the treatment planning system. Even if it is proved not to satisfy perfectly all the tests which would qualify it as a real 3D calculation system, the study of the test results helps to give clear explanations of the dosimetric results. Two series of test cases are proposed. The first series allows us to understand in which conditions the treatment planning system takes into account the scatter influence in a volume. The second series is designed to inform us about the capability of the dose calculation algorithm when the medium encloses non-homogeneities. These test cases do not constitute an exhaustive \"check-list\" able to tackle completely the question of 3D calculation. They are submitted as examples and should be considered as an evaluation methodology for the software implanted in the treatment planning system.","2468":"Retrospective analysis of results of radiotherapy in epidemic Kaposi sarcoma at the Henri-Mondor hospital. From June 1986 to December 1996, 643 patients presenting with acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS)-related epidemic Kaposi's sarcoma were treated with irradiation at the Oncology Department of Henri Mondor University Hospital. Three-hundred eighty-seven patients (60%) had previously received a treatment with interferon (259 patients, 40.2%), vinblastine (225 patients, 34.5%), doxorubicin (22 patients, 3.4%), bleomycin (19 patients, 2.9%), and\/or antiviral treatment (216, 33.5%). The radiotherapy was delivered by 4 MeV or 8 MeV electron beam for extended cutaneous fields and 45-100 kV x-ray for localized fields. The delivered dose was 20 Gy in 2 weeks (2.5 Gy\/fraction, 4 fractions\/week) followed by 2 weeks rest and second series of 10 Gy in 1 week. For oral cavity lesions, we used a series of 15.2 Gy was delivered (1.9 Gy\/fraction, 4 fractions\/week), followed for three patients by a 3 week rest and by a similar second series of 15.2 Gy. Six-hundred and twenty-one patients were evaluable and the objective response rate was 92%, with a complete regression of clinical and functional symptoms for all patients. The skin tolerance was good, with 7.3% grade I reactions, 69.3% of grade II reactions, and 23.4% grade III reactions. There was a correlation between recurrence rate and the occurrence of opportunistic infections. This analysis shows the efficacy of dose radiotherapy for treatment of epidemic Kaposi sarcoma.

After routine radiation therapy, deteriorating clinical status or treatment failure may be due to either radiation changes or recurrent tumor. CT and MRI offer imperfect discrimination of tumor viability and radionecrosis. Thirty-five malignant glioma patients with clinical deterioration were studied retrospectively. Tomoscintigraphy was performed 15 minutes after intravenous injection of 1110 Mbq 99mTc-MIBI. The images were obtained from a dual headed gamma camera using fan beam collimator. Transverse, coronal and sagittal views were reconstructed. A dramatic MIBI uptake was found in 31 patients. This uptake was correlated to tumor recurrence proven by histological fragments and\/or the rapid, fatal evolution of these patients. Death occurred after the brain SPECT had been performed for those cases showing MIBI uptake, an average 5.48 months later. No MIBI uptake was found for these four remaining patients: their evolution can be currently considered to be a disease-free time. According to our results, the sensibility and specificity of 99mTcMIBI brain SPECT seems to be high. Moreover, this investigation is more accurate for discriminating tumor recurrence from radionecrosis than a CT scan or MRI. ","2470":"Surgery is the primary treatment for endometrial carcinoma. Methods of complementary treatment are still debated, with the potential association of external radiotherapy and\/or brachytherapy before or after surgery. This study was aimed at evaluating local control and complications rates in a series of patients treated by hysterectomy followed by postoperative vaginal low-dose rate brachytherapy (BT) combined with pelvic irradiation in case of poor prognosis factors. From 1978 to 1993, 101 patients were treated at the Centre Alexis-Vautrin, France according to this scheme. Forty five had deep myometrial invasion, and thirteen cervical involvement. Fifty patients received pelvic irradiation (median dose 46 Gy) combined with BT (dose 14 Gy, median volume 127 cm3); 51 patients had BT alone (dose 60 Gy, median volume 71 cm3). The 5-year overall survival rate was 83% and the local control rate 97% with a median follow-up of 7 years. Multivariate analysis showed two factors of bad prognosis, i.e., deep myometrial invasion and cervical involvement. Three severe complications occurred in two patients for whom the treated volume was larger than the theoretical target volume. Eleven patients developed metastases. Results obtained from this series are comparable with those of previous studies, particularly in regard to pre-operative BT. The complication rate is also satisfactory and depends on the irradiation precision and the definition of the target volume. ","2471":"The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical and biochemical response to neoadjuvant hormonal therapy (NAHT) before radical external radiotherapy (EBRT). From June 1986 to June 1994, 105 patients with histologically proven and non-metastatic prostate adenocarcinoma (stage B2-C2) received a short induction hormonal therapy (median: 3 months) with a luteinizing hormone releasing hormone (LHRH) analog associated with an anti-androgen followed in all cases by EBRT (66 Gy). All patients underwent a prostate-specific acid (PSA) determination, pelvic computed tomography (CT) scan and bone scan before the combined treatment. Response, treatment toxicity and PSA concentration were analyzed after the NAHT, 3 months after the completion of radiotherapy and every 6 months there after. Relapse was defined by PSA elevations above 4 ng\/mL or two consecutive elevation above 1 ng\/mL. Median follow-up was 52 months. According to the Withmore-Jewett clinical classification, 85 tumors were stage C. Pre-treatment PSA (PSAi) was above 20 ng\/mL in 63.8% of the patients (median PSAi: 26 ng\/mL). A clinical evaluation and a PSA determination (PSAPH) were both performed for all patients after NAHT. Most of the time, urinary obstructive symptoms disappeared with androgen ablation; tumor volume regression exceeded 50% in 99 cases and was complete in 50 cases. Median PSAPH was 0.6 ng\/mL for the entire group. Clinical and biochemical tumor response were coherent: 84% of patients with clinical total remission had a PSAPH &lt; 1 ng\/mL. PSAPH value was significantly correlated with tumor stage and pre-treatment PSAi: among the 11 patients with a PSAPH &gt; 4 ng\/mL, ten were stage C and nine had a PSAi &gt; 20 ng\/mL. A PSAPH value exceeding 4 ng\/mL predicted biochemical relapse (P &lt; 0.0001). We conclude that biochemical response to hormonal therapy has a major prognostic value before EBRT can help to identify patients for an adjuvant hormonal therapy. ","2472":"Retrospective analysis of results of treatment of 132 subclinical ductal carcinomas in situ, non-palpable. Patients were treated with limited surgery and 70 Gy radiation therapy (70 Gy). With a median follow-up of 7 years, the total recurrence rate was 6%, and the actuarial rate at 5 years 4% and at 10 years 13% at. These have no influence on recurrence on the specific actuarial survival rate which was 100% at 10 years. In spite of five infiltrating recurrences of seven, no metastasis appeared 48 months after the salvage surgery. The global rate of breast preservation was 92% at 7 years. Therapeutic indications were developed taking into account the present analysis and a literature review (2,338 in situ ductal carcinomas, palpable or not, treated with conservative surgery, with or without adjuvant radio-therapy). ","2473":"Although the first radiation-induced solid tumor was reported as early as 1902, the risk of second tumor has been underestimated by radiation oncologists who treated large numbers of patients with either benign or malignant diseases. Since then, numerous epidemiological studies yielded better knowledge of the risks of radiation-induced malignancies. For instance, radiation-induced tumors are the first cause of death 10 years after treatment for Hodgkin's disease. We present here a literature review of the risks of radiation-tumors in various organs, related to the irradiation dose, age, and associated diseases. The most sensitive organs are the thyroid, central nervous system, breast, bone, and lung, especially in smokers. Higher risks are observed with increasing doses, the shape of the dose-response curve depending on the tumor type, when the irradiation is performed in children or young adults and in patients with retinoblastomas. The risk of radiation-induced tumors should lead the radiation oncology committee to reconsider the dose and technique of irradiation and to reduce the use of ionizing radiation in benign diseases.","2474":"Combinations of the chemotherapy and radiation therapy are increasingly a part of treatment strategies for cancer. Although directed at distant metastasis, they may have little effect on the primary tumor and regional lymph nodes. The local tumor must be controlled to 1) eliminate life-threatening complications, 2) decrease the risk of distant metastasis, and 3) permit organ conservation. Induction chemotherapy has been shown to be effective in decreasing distant metastasis, but it does affect local tumor control in common epithelial tumors. Concurrent single agent chemotherapy can increase local control with radiation therapy and combination chemotherapy concurrent with irradiation can both improve local control and decrease distant metastasis. Combination chemoradiation therapy has become a major part of research strategies of the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG): it has been shown to improve local control and survival in carcinomas of the esophagus and nasopharynx. Combination chemoradiation has increased organ conservation in carcinoma of the anal canal and it is under investigation for carcinomas of the larynx (laryngeal preservation), other head and neck sites, lung, and cervix. The equation--increased local tumor control + decreased distant metastasis = increased survival--is the paradigm. Systemic therapy with cytotoxic drugs or hormones needs to address both potential sites of failure.","2475":"","2476":null,"2477":"The most effective chemotherapy of metastatic bladder cancer in M-VAC (methotrexate, vinblastine, cisplatin), as it was shown M-VAC by phase III trials. The complete remission rate is 15-20%. The toxicity is severe, and M-VAC cannot be delivered to fragile patients. Survival is improved. This increase in survival results in an increased incidence in brain metastases. The Cochin Hospital experience with 50 patients treated with M-VAC for a metastatic bladder cancer is presented.","2478":"Therapeutic strategies for muscle invasive bladder cancer are currently evolving. A recent European randomized study has shown that neoadjuvant chemotherapy does not improve the chance of cure or and radiotherapy would provide better results but there is a need to identify by prognostic factors patients who may benefit from such a conservative strategy. One hundred and nine patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer, who were not candidates for radical cystectomy, were treated with concomitant cisplatin and radiation therapy. Their mean age was 71. Thirty-six percent of the patients had T3B-4 tumors, and 37% had benefited from prior macroscopically complete transurethral resection (TUR). Pelvic irradiation consisted of 40 to 45 Gy and was followed by a boost to the bladder to a total dose of 55 to 60 Gy. Continuous infusion cisplatin (20 to 25 mg\/m2\/d for 5 days) was delivered during the second and fifth weeks of radiation therapy. Median follow-up was 73 months. The projected 5-year locoregional control rate was 43% for the 109 patients and 55% for the 86 patients with complete response. The projected overall 5-year survival rate was 36% for all patients and 44% for complete responders. Univariate analysis of prognostic factors was carried out for local control, and survival. The local control was statistically better in patients with good performance status, T2-3A, complete initial TUR, and in patients without hydronephrosis. In terms of overall survival, four factors were significant: the performance status, T-stage, absence of hydronephrosis, and complete response. By multivariate analysis, performance status, hydronephrosis and T-stage were significant factors for local control, while T-stage and complete response were the strongest determinants for survival. Concurrent cisplatin and radiation therapy is a potentially locally curative treatment for 43% of patients with muscle-invasive bladder cancer not candidates for radical surgery. Clinical T-stage and hydronephrosis have a significant and independent prognostic value on local control but appears not discriminant enough to select patients for conservative treatment. ","2479":"Two sequences of concomitant chemotherapy with 5-FU + cisplatin and hyperfractionated radiotherapy (67.2 Gy\/56 fractions\/38 days, two fractions of 1.2 Gy per day spaced to 6 hours) in the bladder volume were administered to 17 patients with infiltrative carcinoma of the bladder (1 pT1, 6 pT2, 8 pT3a, 2 pT3b or pT4, 8\/17 N0-2). They were separated by an interval of 21 days with an intermediate bladder tumor evaluation. A complete histological response was observed in 69% (11 of 16 evaluable patients). With a mean follow-up of 21 months, the bladder preservation was stated in 8\/11 (73%) of patients treated, of whom 6 with a complete tumor response, and 2 with a pTa recurrence; these results are similar to other series reported with conventional radiation therapy. No deficit in the bladder was observed in these eight patients.","2480":"Pilot study to assess treatment feasibility and results of a 2-drug chemotherapy (CT) regimen administered concurrently with radiotherapy (RT) for muscle-invasive bladder cancer. Fourty-six patients were included into a prospective study from December 1992 to April 1996. The median age was 66 years. Thirty-seven percent of the patients had T3B-T4 tumors, and 46% had benefited from prior macroscopically complete transurethral resection (TUR). Pelvic irradiation consisted of 50.4 Gy in 28 fractions over 39 days. Concurrent CT consisting of cisplatin (80 mg\/m2\/d1) and 5-fluorouracil (800 mg\/m2\/d2 to 5) by continuous infusions (5-FU) was delivered during the first and fifth weeks of radiation therapy. Twenty-three patients received two additional courses of adjuvant CT with cisplatin, methotrexate and vinblastin (MCV). The median follow-up was 38 months. The feasibility of concurrent CT-RT was excellent: 96% of the patients completed radiotherapy and 100% of them received the two courses of P-FU. The acute toxicity was mild: no hematological toxicity or renal toxicity over grade II, 4 cases of bowel or rectal reversible grade III toxicity and 2 cases of reversible grade III cystitis. A complete response was achieved in 30 out of the 42 evaluable patients (65.2%). Nine patients received an immediate salvage treatment (3 TUR, 3 additional radiotherapy and 3 cystectomies). Ten patients had local failure. Projected 3-year locoregional control was 49% for the 46 patients. Projected overall 3-year survival was 53%. Functional results were good for disease-free patients with preserved bladder: 1 grade I, 3 grade II, and no grade III cystitis. Concurrent 2-drug chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and 5-fluorouracil is feasible without major toxicity and offers a potentially curative and conservative treatment for patients with localized muscle-invasive bladder cancer. ","2481":"Analysis of the results obtained in elderly (75 years and older) included a phase II trial combining intra-arterial cisplatin and concurrent radiation into invasive bladder cancer. Thirty-five patients (28 males and 7 females) were accrued from 1985 to 1996. There were 1 Ta, 4 T2, 11 T3A, 12 T3B, 3 T4A, and 4 T4B patients. Nine had unilateral hydronephrosis and two bilateral hydronephrosis. There were 28 transurethral resections which were incomplete in 23 patients. Intra-arterial cisplatin was given as 2-4 hours infusion (60-90 mg\/m2) split through both internal iliac arteries on day 1, 14, 21, and 42. Irradiation to the pelvis was started on day 14 and consisted of 40 Gy\/20 fractions followed by a boost of 20 Gy\/10 fractions to the tumor with margins of 2 cm. Thirty (86%) completed fully the protocol. One patient died from sepsis secondary to the treatment. The tumor response was evaluable in 29 patients and complete response was observed for 27 of them. Five of these 27 patients had an isolated bladder relapse which was salvaged by cystectomy in two patients. There were 11 deaths from bladder cancer (31% of the patients): 9 from distant metastase, one from local failure, and one from treatment. This combined modality yields excellent results with high complete response rate and good tolerance. This approach may therefore be particularly appropriate for the elderly. ","2482":"Until now, radical cystectomy has been considered the most effective treatment for invasive bladder cancer. However, it fails to cure more than 50% of patients and can result in a mediocre quality of life. In an effort to improve cure rates, combined modality regimens have been investigated. Despite the preliminary results of early clinical trials, randomized trials have most often failed to show any benefit from neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy or radiotherapy. One of the major progress brought by radiotherapy has been the wide use of conservative treatment in several cancer, and in the recent years promising results with concomitant radiochemotherapy have been published. Use of the conservative approach in bladder cancer now appears to be a tangible reality for selected patients, but these combined modalities have not yet been tested in randomized trials.","2483":"Retrospective evaluation of tolerance and efficacity of a combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy in non metastatic invasive cancer of the bladder. From 1984 to 1995, 36 patients presenting with invasive urothelial carcinoma of the bladder were treated conservatively with primary chemotherapy: cisplatin-methotrexate-vinblastine (24 patients), methotrexate-vinblastine-doxorubicin-cisplatin (11 patients) or carboplatin (one patient). Fourty-six Gy were then delivered by external radiation therapy to the pelvis, with a complement of 10 to 20 Gy to the bladder. Seventeen patients received a concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin. The intolerance to chemotherapy was hematologic and digestive. One patient died from bone marrow depletion. External irradiation was well tolerated, except for one patient whose treatment was stopped at 48 Gy. Fifteen tumours (44%) were in complete remission (CR) after chemotherapy and 23 (64%) at the end of treatment. With a median follow up of 64.6 months, 13 out of 23 patients in CR had a relapse (ten local relapses, three metastatic); five salvage cystectomies were done. The median survival and 26 months and the probability of survival at 5 years was 43%. All but two patients surviving 5 years had a functional bladder. Neoadjuvant chemotherapy leads to CR in 44% of patients and CR is observed in 64% of the patients after radiation therapy. However, the survival rate at 5 years is insufficient, even if the rate of bladder conservation is high. ","2484":"From 1975 to 1996, 98 patients with infiltrative vesical carcinomas were treated at the Centre Alexis Vautrin by conservative surgery and interstitial brachytherapy (192lr). The mean follow-up was about eight years. From this retrospective non randomized study, we tried to determine the tolerance to this treatment. There were 86 men and 12 women. The mean age was 63 years. We found three pTis tumors, 28 stage pT1 tumors, 38 stage pT2 tumors, 24 stage pT3A tumors, four stage pT3B tumors and one stage Tx tumors. The therapeutic scheme consisted of pelvic radiation therapy (3 fractions of 3,5 Gy) immediately followed by lymphadenectomy (for stage pT3 tumors) and by cystotomy or partial cystectomy during which we inserted brachytherapy plastic tubes. The delivered dose was 50 Gy for superficially infiltrative tumors and 30 Gy for deeply infiltrative tumors; at the lowest dose, the treatment ended with external beam irradiation. At 5 years the control rate was 72%, the specific survival 80% and the global survival 71%. Twenty-nine patients had a local recurrence. Of these, seven underwent total cystectomy. Thirty-seven patients developed 43 complications; 35 were intravesical, 10 (28%) were estimated to be higher than grade 2 because of technical problems that led us to modify the technique. It is essential to develop close collaboration between surgeons and brachytherapists, to select patients and to use a rigorous technique. Interstitial brachytherapy for infiltrative vesical carcinomas thus yields both high local control and satisfying results in regard to patient's well-being. ","2485":"Bladder cancer is more frequent in Quebec, especially in Saguenay-Lac Saint-Jean than in other Canadian provinces and in the USA. From 1983 to 1996, only 78 patients presenting with bladder cancer received external beam radiation therapy. Sixty-eight were treated with curative intent. Overall survival rates were 70% at 3 years, 66% at 5 years, and 40% at 10 years. Retrospective analysis of these cases and literature review show that preoperative radiation therapy is useful in the management of bladder cancer, especially in T3 tumors. It is also useful for patients whose tumor objectively responds to radiation therapy, without an increase in morbidity.","2486":"In the Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean area, an abnormal incidence of bladder cancer bas been identified. This incidence is an effect of the important industrial environment and the etiology has been identified. A review of the surgical treatment is actually done. Following this evaluation, we have made a choice in our medical environment (the ileal conduit or the detubularised ileal bladder for a replacement after a radical cystectomy). For the 1970 to 1997 period, a statistic statement has been done and shows the patients survival in accordance with the grade and the stage. A more appropriate treatment should be given in T3A and T3B stages. In conclusion, we have instituted a group of stimulus in the industrial environment to improve the survival for the next decades.","2487":"We reviewed the results of infiltrating bladder cancer treated by radical cystectomy to evaluate survival. Between January 1989 and December 1992, a total of 58 consecutive cystectomies or anterior pelvectomies performed on 48 men and 10 women (mean age 63.2 years) in our department were retrospectively evaluated. Four patients were lost to follow-up and the mean follow-up was 72 months. Pathologic staging was as follows: stage pT0,A,1: 13.5%, stage pT2: 17.5%, stage pT3a: 12%, stage pT3b: 36%, stage pT4: 21%. The year probability of the overall survival was 60% for p T2-p T3a patients, 15% for pT3b patients, and 9% for pT4 patients, respectively. Overall, 53.5% of patients died of cancer, 7.5% of intercurrent disease, and 39% were alive. The cancer related death rate was 12% for pT2-pT3a patients, and 82% for pT3b-pT4 patients. The 5- year probability of specific survival was 80% for pT2-pT3a patients, 15% for pT3b patients, and 9% for pT4 patients, respectively. Infiltrating bladder cancer still has a high mortality rate. Radical cystectomy may be considered to be a curative procedure for stages pT2 and pT3a. Adjuvant chemotherapy and\/or radiotherapy seem necessary at stages pT3b and pT4. Preoperative criteria need to be better defined to reduce understaging.","2488":"Replacement of bladder after cystectomies avoids urinary diversion. It allows suboptimal natural miction, especially during the day. Current surgical techniques allow reconstruction of the bladder with detubulated ileal small bowel. This major procedure is achievable if the patient performance status is satisfactory and if urethra can be conserved. Bladder replacement is also feasible in women in selected cases. There is a need for long-term follow-up because of the risk of urological complications, especially ureteral stenosis and metabolic disorders.","2489":"The authors present results that were obtained by combining endoscopic resection and external beam radiation therapy in a population of 55 patients presenting with bladder cancer. They also explain the difficulties they encountered in the management of bladder cancer at the Ibn Rochd Cancer Center (Casablanca, Morocco).","2490":null,"2491":null,"2492":"","2493":"","2494":"We reassessed the use of DNA flow cytometry in bladder cancers on the basis of our research and already published findings. We discuss technical aspects underlying the validity of the results. Currently, the validity of DNA flow cytometry is established by parametric analysis of the DNA content of tumor cells found in the course of multiple biopsies of the tumor. In addition, we examine the results obtained with bladder washings and, in some cases, the results of biopsies of the bladder mucosa which may appear normal under cystoscopy. The complementarity of these examinations appears to be essential. Our experience confirms the results already published, suggesting that the frequency of DNA aneuploidy increases significantly according to the grade and the tumor stage. However, clinical interpretation of DNA flow cytometry results calls for some caution. There is a general consensus not to use these results in the screening of bladder cancers. However, DNA flow cytometry is particularly useful in the follow-up of carcinoma in situ since DNA aneuploidy is almost always present. DNA flow cytometry is also useful in the stratification of superficial grade 2 tumors. Finally, during the follow-up of invasive tumors, the persistence or appearance of DNA aneuploidy may be attributed to therapeutic resistance.","2495":"In France, invasive bladder cancer is the more frequent urologic malignancy after prostate carcinoma. Treatment of bladder cancer is radical cystectomy. New therapeutic approaches such as chemoradiation combination for a conservative procedure, neoadjuvant or adjuvant chemotherapy are still developing. In this way, a rigorous selection of patients is needed. This selection is based on prognostic criteria that could be divided into four groups: i) the volume of the tumor including the tumor infiltration depth, the nodal status, the presence or not of hydronephrosis and the residual tumor mass after transuretral resection; ii) the histologic aspects of the tumor including histologic grading, the presence or not of an epidermoid metaplasia, of in situ carcinoma or of thrombi; iii) the expression of tumor markers (tissue polypeptide antigen, bladder tumor antigen); iv) the biologic aspects of the tumor as ploidy, cytogenetic abnormalities, expression of Ki67, expression of oncogenes or tumor suppressor genes, expression of tumor antigens or growth factor receptors. This paper reviews the prognostic value of the various parameters.","2496":"","2497":"At the present time, the current improvement of technical and dosimetric aspects of radiation oncology has to be evaluated in terms of potential benefit for the patient and the society. For this last point of view, specially designed economic analyses must be performed in order to justify the number of resources involved by these technical improvements. If the question is how the current technical procedures could reduce the risk of undesirable side-effects, the response cannot be immediately drawn from the literature. This paper emphasizes the possibility to evaluate the role of side-effects as endpoints of economic analyses when using special models in medical decision making such as Markov's. Only few oncologic situations are reliable to properly analyze the relationship between sophisticated radiation techniques and the incidence of post-radiation complications. These situations should be selected when prospective economic analyses are planned in the field of radiation therapy.","2498":"Scientists now have available a large amount of data dealing with radiation-induced neoplasms. These data went back to anecdotal observations which were made in the very first years of utilization of X-rays and radioactive elements. In fact, it is essentially the strict follow-up of the Japanese populations irradiated by the Hiroshima and Nagasaki bombing which allowed a more precise evaluation of the carcinogenicity of ionizing radiations. Further refinements came from therapeutical irradiations: it is now possible to study large cohorts of patients given well-known doses in well-defined volumes and followed for more than 20 years. Last but not least, a significant increase in the incidence and mortality of thyroid cancer has been detected in children contaminated by iodine radioisotopes after the Tchernobyl accident. Recently, some data suggested the emergence of \"clusters\" of leukemias close to some nuclear facilities, but this question remains highly polemical, both in France and in the UK. Other questions are still waiting for a precise answer; of course, the extrapolation of our available data to very low doses delivered at very low dose rates, but also the carcinogenic risk at high doses. For these \"high\" doses (about 30 to 70 Gy), a competition between mutagenesis and cell killing was expected, so that these dose levels were expected to be less carcinogenic than lower (a few sieverts) doses. Actually, recent data suggest that the carcinogenic risk goes on increasing up to relatively important doses. In addition, carcinogenic factors, such as tabacco, anticancer chemotherapy and individual susceptibility, are found more and more to be closely intricated with ionizing radiation in the genesis of a given cancer. Even if a number of questions are still pending, the already available data allow specialists, both in medicine and radioprotection, to edict strict rules which can be reasonably expected to have significantly reduced the risk of radiation-induced neoplasms in most situations.","2499":null,"2500":"Although most pediatric tumors can be cured with lower doses of radiation than their adult counterparts, long-term radiation-induced complications and sequelae remain a major concern both in terms of frequency and intensity. Most of them have been extensively documented in the pre-chemotherapeutic era like those affecting bone, cartilage and soft tissue growth or CNS and endocrine glands. More recently the emphasis has been put on the apparent increasing incidence of reported second malignancies. This could have been favored by the chemo-radiation combinations used in most children but also has been made possible mainly by the extensive follow-up of the increasing cohort of cured children.","2501":"The physiopathology of radiation-induced bone damage is no completely elucidated. Ionizing radiation may induce an inhibition or an impairment of growing bone. This fact is of particular importance in children, and represents one of the most important dose-limiting factors in the radiotherapeutic management of children with malignant diseases. Scoliosis, epiphyseal slippage, avascular necrosis, abnormalities of craniofacial growth may be observed after radiation. Child's age at the time of treatment, location of irradiated bone and irradiation characteristics may influence the radiation-related observed effects. In adults, pathological analysis of mature bone after ionizing radiation exposure are rare, suggesting that it is difficult to draw a clear feature of the action of radiation on the bone. Osteoporosis, medullary fibrosis and cytotoxicity on bone cells lead to fracture or necrosis. Various factors can influence bone tolerance to radiation such as bone involvement by tumor cells or infection, which is frequent is mandibulary osteoradionecrosis. Technical improvements in radiation techniques have also decreased radio-induced bone complications: the volume, fractionation and total dose are essential to consider. The absence of a consistent radiation-induced late effects evaluation scale has hampered efforts to analyze the influence of various therapeutic maneuvers and the comparison of results from different reported series. The currently proposed evaluation scale may help harmonizing the classification of radiation-induced bone late effects.","2502":"Bone marrow is a tissue with a high mitotic activity, and consequently exquisitely radiosensitive. The clinical effects of bone marrow irradiation and its ability of regeneration are related to the volume irradiated. Management of hematopoietic side effects of radiation include surveillance, antibiotics, blood products transfusion, and more scarcely hematopoietic growth factors, bone marrow transplantation and peripheral blood stem cells reinfusion.","2503":"There are few data regarding the adverse effects of radiotherapy on skeletal muscle. This tissue is considered to be radioresistant. Muscle toxicity of radiation is unfrequent and does not represent a limiting factor for dose escalation.","2504":"Reporting and scoring complications after radiotherapy of gynaecological cancers is difficult because of the variety of treatment techniques involved. Use of an international classification is necessary to compare results obtained in series of patients treated in different institutions. An international group of experts designed in the early nineties the so-called French-Italian glossary. This classification of late effects is now completed with the new LENT SOMA scales. This paper contains details of these late changes, including their pathophysiology, clinical syndromes, potential treatment, and prevention.","2505":"Most of the basic data regarding the effect of radiation on the testis are issued from animal studies. They demonstrate the extreme radiosensitivity on the germ cell lineage but little is known about the reversible or definitive aspects of these radiation induced effects. In man, the late non stochastic effects of radiation to the testicule are mainly related to persisting spermatogenesis disturbances or\/and hormone related problems. Morphological, physiological, radiobiological specificities of the human testis along with numerous parameters depending on radiation conditions make it difficult to evaluate the late effects and radiation tolerance doses. Evaluation of such effects based on a common scale for therapeutic radiation schedules would improve the present understanding and possibly prevent the occurrence of these delayed effects, for the benefit of patients.","2506":"Late rectal morbidity has been observed in 2%-25% of patients treated with radiotherapy using curative doses for prostate, cervix and rectal cancers. The major encountered clinical pictures are rectal proctitis, rectal\/anal strictures, rectal bleeding, ulcers and fistula. Some may alter the patient's lifestyle while other may induce death. Recommendations concerning the clinical practice are described. The treatment of these late rectal effects include nutritional recommendations, laser, formalin application, and surgery.","2507":"Pre or postoperative pelvic irradiation has demonstrated a definitive efficacy in reducing the local failure rate of rectal cancer treated with surgery alone. However it can induce late small bowel morbidity that could alter the therapeutic ratio. The clinical pictures of radiation enteritis include obstruction and diarrhea\/malabsorption. Prognostic factors that increase the risk of late small bowel complications include extended fields out of the pelvis, irradiation dose, inappropriate irradiation technique, and increased small bowel irradiated volumes. The addition of chemotherapy increases acute but not late toxicity. Recommendations concerning the clinical practice are described. Radiotherapy may also alter the residual sphincter function and we recommend to assess correctly these complications.","2508":"Clinical effects of radiation on bladder are in relation with their effects on various tissus of this organ. The most important is the vessels. According to clinical models; it is possible to evaluate the different factors, especially the dose and the irradiated volume. The risk of complications rise with these two factors. Drugs used in bladder cancer don't seem to increase the risk of complications. The prevention of the late effects lies on the tissue protection and on the precise evaluation of the irradiated volume in view to reduce them.","2509":"Clinical radiation damage to the kidney are nowadays a rare event. Nevertheless, this organ is very sensitive to radiation and dose exceeding 15 Gy may induce severe and life threatening damage many years after the treatment. Prevention remains the best treatment through a precise localisation of the kidneys before any irradiation of the upper abdomen.","2510":"Until recently, the liver was classified as a radioresistant organ, although it is in fact highly radiosensitive. The realization that the whole liver could be treated safely only with low doses of radiation led to the conclusion that radiation therapy had an extremely limited role in the treatment of intrahepatic malignancies. A resurgence of interest has been observed with the advent of conformal radiotherapy and the introduction of bone marrow transplantation with total body irradiation. The radiation-induced liver disease, often called radiation hepatitis, is a syndrome characterized by the development of anicteric ascites, approximately 2 weeks to 4 months after hepatic irradiation. Immediate tolerance is generally surprisingly good, and the subacute radiation injury is followed by a complete asymptomatic healing, although the late lesions may be associated with signs of chronic radiation hepatitis. Radiation hepatitis must be distinguished from chemoradiation-induced-hepatitis occurring in patients undergoing bone marrow transplantation and total body irradiation. Both syndromes demonstrate the same pathological lesion: veno-occlusive disease. The main treatment for radiation hepatitis is diuretics, although soma advocate steroids for severe cases.","2511":"Late damages to the skin and subcutaneous tissues are almost inescapable because of the high skin doses required in the irradiation of breast tumours. While the clinical and histological descriptions date back to the first decades of the therapeutic use of ionising radiation, the recent advances in cellular and molecular biology have significantly contributed to the increased understanding of late skin injury mechanisms. In particular, sub-cutaneous fibrosis appears to be the partly reversible results of a continuous and self-maintained local process, possibly sensitive to therapeutic intervention. A second very active research avenue is the development of biologic assays potentially able to predict the probability of increased normal tissue injury after irradiation in individual patients. Such a test would allow the adaptation of the treatment modalities to the radiobiological behaviour of normal tissues. To date, these expectations have not been met. The quality of the irradiation and its modalities (total dose, fractionation, inter fraction interval) remain the main ways to achieve an optimal functional and cosmetic outcome.","2512":"High doses of ionizing radiation (&gt; 40 Gy) cause severe lung fibrosis in approximately 5% of the cases. There is a twofold increase when chemotherapy is added to ionizing radiation. Lung fibrosis is due to the destruction of lung tissue by ionizing radiation but also to various cytokine effects (PDGF-beta, TGF-beta). Only a minority of patients (approximately 10%) with abnormal X-rays will experience clinical symptoms. The most important radiobiological parameters which accounts for pulmonary tolerance is the fraction size. Irradiation of the heart begets multifarious late sequelae which are often left unrecognized. Chronic pericarditis affects approximately 5% of the patients when the irradiation dose exceeds 40 Gy. Coronary artery disease can be diagnosed in 5 to 10% of the patients. This late complication is more likely to occur if the patient was young at the time of the irradiation or if other risk factors are associated. Valvular defects can be found in 15 to 30% of the patients. However, the mortality rate is very low (0.5%). Finally, conduction defects can also be seen in approximately 5% of the patients. It is very likely that the radiation dose given to the heart should not exceed 30 Gy if late sequelae are to be avoided.","2513":"Radiation-induced late effects of oesophagus are observed after treatment for various cancers. Acute reactions, mainly oesophagitis, are well known and accurately described; late effects share, for most of these, a common consequence: alteration of the main oesophageal function, namely to conduct the food bolus; clinically they are impaired in terms of mobility and stenosis. More rarely, ulcerations and pseudodiverticulae can be observed. Chemotherapy further increases the risk of late effects, especially in case of concomitant chemo-radiotherapy. All numbers and statistical data on oesophagus late effects should be regarded with caution due to recent changes in the therapeutic attitudes (more and more combined chemotherapy-radiotherapy) and some progress in given cancer locations. A common scale like the LENT-SOMA should enable the clinician to better know these late effects on oesophagus which is required to initiate effective prevention measures and adapted treatments.","2514":"The thyroid is the purest endocrine gland in the body and is likely to produce clinically significant abnormalities after external radiotherapy. Functional clinical modifications after direct irradiation exceeding 30 Gy are essentially related to hypothyroidism which may be clinically overt or subclinical with normal serum free thyroxine levels and high thyrotropin concentrations; the risk of hyperthyroidism, silent thyroiditis and Hashimoto's disease is also increased. Secondary hypothyroidism related to irradiation of the hypothalamus and the pituitary gland may arise with doses over 40-50 Gy following treatment for brain and nasopharyngeal tumors--Morphological glandular modifications induced by radiotherapy are responsible for the appearance of benign adenomas, more rarely cystic degenerations and specially well differentiated papillary or follicular carcinomas among children and adults. After irradiation during childhood for benign or malignant tumors, thyroid cancers are more frequent, higher for younger children, and the relative excess risk is increased from 15.6-to 53-fold; tumors can belatedly occur, more than 35 years after initial therapy. Thereby, in order to limit excess morbidity, it is evident that long term supervision with careful clinical and biological evaluations is necessary for patients who previously received neck, upper mediastinum and pituitary radiation therapy.","2515":"When the hypothalamic-pituitary axis (HPA) is included in the treatment field in children and adults, a variety of neuroendocrine disturbances are more common than has been appreciated in the past. Clinical damage to the pituitary and thyroid glands usually occurs months to years after treatment, and is preceded by a long subclinical phase. Primary brain tumors represent the largest group of malignant solid tumors in children. The survival rates of 50% reported in the literature are achieved at the expense of late occurring effects. Radiation-induced abnormalities are generally dose-dependent. Growth hormone deficiency and premature sexual development can occur at doses as low as 18 Gy in conventional fractionation, and is the most common neuroendocrine problem in children. In patients treated with &gt; 40 Gy on the HPA, deficiency of gonadotropins, thyroid stimulating hormone, and adrenocorticotropin can be found. Following high-dose radiotherapy (&gt; 50 Gy), hyperprolactinemia can be seen, especially among young women. Most neuroendocrine disturbances that develop as a result of HPA can be treated efficiently, provided that an early detection of these endocrine dysfunctions abnormalities is done.","2516":"Numerous structures are included in the irradiated volume of patients presenting with head and neck cancer: skin, mucosa, bone, teeth, cartilage, muscles, salivary glands, etc. Curative intent treatment of such tumours requires aggressive approach which can lead to severe sequellae. These sequellae are in most cases dose-dependent and volume-dependent. However, an appropriate technique might decrease the severity of such sequellae. Details of these late changes are presented, including their pathophysiology, clinical syndromes, potential treatment, and prevention.","2517":"Late ocular effects after irradiation of the eyes and ocular adnexa are reviewed. Ocular and orbital injuries occur more often after irradiation of central nervous system neoplasms or treatment of paranasal sinus malignancies. The complete loss of vision is the major complication which is multifactorial. This paper describes the radiation effects and grading of ocular adnexa, lens, retina, optic nerves and orbit. The tolerance doses and treatment are described.","2518":"Despite the lack of characteristic features, demyelination is the dominant feature of radiation induced late effects observed in cerebral nervous system and spinal cord. Acute, subacute and chronic changes are described in terms of pathological, clinical and radiological observations. Brain necrosis in adults is rarely noted below 60 Gy in conventional fractionation, while imaging changes are observed with lower doses. The most widely observed dose limit for the spinal cord is 45 Gy, in the absence of dose modifying chemotherapy. Tumor progression may be hard to distinguish from radiochemotherapy effects. The potential protective role of hyperfractionation is not yet clearly established. Peripheral nerves late effects, although rare, are described.","2519":"The daily practice of radiation oncology is increasingly influenced by the late tolerance of normal tissues. The treatment decision must be based on detailed arguments and the physician's duty to extensively inform his patients is emphasised every day. The incidence and severity of radiation-induced sequelae and late complications can be reduced by decreasing the total dose to the normal tissues, and by decreasing the dose protraction, provided that the interval between fractions remains longer than 6 to 8 hours. This approach yields a selective protection of late responding normal tissues, since tumours are less sensitive to the effects of fractionation. Despite its own limitations, the linear- quadratic model is nowadays the standard method to compare the biological effects of different radiation treatments.","2520":"Radiation tolerance of normal tissues remains the limiting factor for delivering tumoricidal dose. The late toxicity of normal tissues is the most critical element of an irradiation: somatic, functional and structural alterations occur during the actual treatment itself, but late effects manifest months to years after acute effects heal, and may progress with time. The optimal therapeutic ratio ultimately requires not only complete tumor clearance, but also minimal residual injury to surrounding vital normal tissues. The disparity between the intensity of acute and late effects and the inability to predict the eventual manifestations of late normal tissue injury has made radiation oncologists recognize the importance of careful patient follow-up. There is so far no uniform toxicity scoring system to compare several clinical studies in the absence of a \"common toxicity language\". This justifies the need to establish a precise evaluation system for the analysis of late effects of radiation on normal tissues. The SOMA\/LENT scoring system results from an international collaboration. European Organization Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) and Radiation Therapy Oncology Group (RTOG) have created subcommittees with the aim of addressing the question of standardized toxic effects criteria. This effort appeared as a necessity to standardize and improve the data recording, to then describe and evaluate uniform toxicity at regular time intervals. The current proposed scale is not yet validated, and should be used cautiously.","2521":"","2522":"Prospective evaluation of a virtual simulation technique. From September 1993 to February 1997, 343 patients underwent radiation therapy using this technique. Treated sites were mostly: brain (132), rectum (59), lung (43), and prostate (28). A CT-scan was performed on a patient in treatment position. Twenty-five to 70 jointive slices widely encompassed the treated volume. The target volume (CTV according to ICRU 50) and often critical organs were controured, slice by slice, by the radiation oncologist. Beams covering the CTV plus a security margin (PTV) were placed on the \"virtual patient\". Digital radiographs were reconstructed (DRR) as simulator radiographs for each field. Thus, the good coverage of PTV was assessed. Fields and beam arrangements were further optimized. Definitive isocenter was then placed using a classical simulator. Perfect matching of DRR and actual simulator radiographs had to be obtained. Nineteen patients presented grade 3, and 1 grade 4 acute radiation effects. With a median follow-up of 18 months, five patients suffered from grade 3, and one from grade 4 complications. Fifty-five patients had tumor recurrence in the treated volume, and 19 had marginal relapse. In our department, virtual simulation has become a routine technique of treatment planning for deep-seated tumors. This technique remains time-consuming for radiation oncologists: about 2 hours. But it stimulates reflexion on anatomy, tumor extension pathways, target volumes; and is becoming an excellent pedagogical tool. ","2523":"State of the art imaging and computer systems coupled with the development of superior visualisation and multiplane reconstruction software have opened new perspectives in treatment planning. \"Virtual simulation\" of the irradiation technique allows definition in 3D of the optimised geometrical characteristics of the treatment beams with respect to anatomical structures of the patient. One can then visualise the beam direction and target volume coverage in the \"virtual patient\", leading to very precise radiotherapy. However, this \"three dimensional\" approach requires not only technical means, but also a methodology and an appropriate system of quality assurance for each step of the treatment planning, as well as significant multidisciplinary input.","2524":"The purpose was to evaluate the use of the CT option for simulator during a 14-month period in the radiotherapy department. The CT option has been adapted on the Philips simulator SL23. The virtual tunnel diameter is 92 cm which allows slice acquisition regardless of the contention device used. This system is connected to the treatment planning system through an Ethernet link. Three fields of view are available which cover the standard radiotherapy use. Four hundred and twenty-seven patients benefited from this system over a 14-month period of use. The number of slices acquired per patient regularly increased. The use of the system was rapidly extended to all the standard treatments. Those slices were also used as additional information for these high technology treatments. The good quality of the images and the reliability of this system involved a rapid integration in the treatment preparation procedure. It will not replace the use of the scanner but will significantly improve the treatment quality.","2525":null,"2526":"Pancreatic cancer still have bad prognosis. At the time of diagnosis, less than 10% of patients can undergo surgery with an overall 5-year survival rate of less than 2%. For patients with localized pancreatic adenocarcinoma, the combination of radiation therapy and chemotherapy has been shown to control symptoms and to enhance patient survival. This treatment should be proposed to all the patients with good performance status and without icterus. Pain management should be optimized and often need morphinic and co-antalgic (anticonvulsivants, steroids) consumption. The celiac plexus block with alcohol gives an excellent pain relief and should be more frequently used.","2527":"The prognosis of pancreatic adenocarcinoma remains poor, with a 5-year survival rate lower than 5%. Resection, the gold standard treatment, can be performed in less than 10% of patients. Following surgery, the median survival is 12 months for the most favorable patients. Concomitant chemoradiation, as an adjuvant treatment is superior to surgery alone, in terms of survival, controlled trials are currently performed. Neoadjuvant chemoradiation is a new approach, potentially able to increase survival and resection rate. This work justifies the role of these schemes, in terms of modalities and potential advantages.","2528":"Resection of the pancreas is still the only way to cure patients with pancreatic cancer. Morbidity and mortality rates following pancreatico-duodenectomy for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas have decreased. Survival has improved during the past several decades.","2529":"The prognosis for adenocarcinoma of the pancreas remains poor. Besides surgical treatment of operable localised tumours, many questions are raised: what is the role of adjuvant therapies, chemo-radiotherapy, pre-operative or post-operative combinations, and what is the role of radiotherapy or chemo-radiotherapy during surgery? In the case of inoperable tumours, there is no consensus on the role and the value of various protocols whose toxicity is generally high. Improvements in treatment must come from a better understanding of the role of various prognostic factors (biological markers in particular).","2530":"Extension of the image network within radiotherapy departments provides the technical infrastructure which is made necessary by the rapid evolution of techniques in the field of diagnosis and treatment in radiotherapy. The system is aimed at managing the whole set of data (textual data and images) that are needed for planning and control of treatments. The radiotherapy network addresses two objectives: managing both the information necessary for treatment planning (target volumes definition, planning dosimetry) and the control of all parameters involved during the patient's treatment under the treatment unit. The major challenge is to improve the quality of treatment. Multimodal imaging is a major advance as it allows the use of new dosimetry and simulation techniques. The need for standards to exchange medical imaging information is now recognized by all the institutions and a majority of users and manufacturers. It is widely accepted that the lack of standard has been one of the fundamental obstacles in the deployment of operational \"Picture Archiving Communication Systems\". The International Standard Organisation Open System Interconnection model is the standard reference mode used to describe network protocols. The network is based on the Ethernet and TCP\/IP protocol that provides the means to interconnect imaging devices and workstations dedicated to specific image processing or machines used in radiotherapy. The network uses Ethernet cabled on twisted-pair (10 BaseT) or optical fibres in a star-shaped physical layout. Dicom V3.0 supports fundamental network interactions: transfer of images (computerized tomography magnetic resonance imaging query and retrieve of images), printing on network attached cameras, support of HIS\/RIS related interfacing and image management. The supplement to the Dicom standard, Dicom RT, specifies five data objects known in Dicom as Information Object Definition for relevant radiotherapy. Dicom RT objects can provide a mean for standardized transfer of most of the information wich circulates in a radiotherapy department. A wide range of device types are represented, (treatment planning systems, portal imaging devices, linear accelerators, recording and verifying systems, conventional and virtual simulators). There will be additions and perhaps new developments in dataflow management, more complete integration with HIS\/RIS system and printing, but the lion's share of the work has now been done. A project to integrate some security features into the Dicom protocol has begun.","2531":"Intra Operative Radiation Therapy (IORT) has been routinely used for the past 20 years. It is a feasible treatment, with a reasonable cost and an acceptable acute and late toxicity. There is so far no strong randomized trial demonstrating that IORT can improve overall survival. Nevertheless, in many institutions it is recognized as an efficient treatment in selected patients. In case of locally recurrent disease an incomplete gross resection is often the only choice; IORT in such a situation has led to very encouraging results. For locally advanced deep seated primary tumors IORT seems to improve local control. In the near future IORT should be used on a larger and stronger basis. The manufacturing of new mobile linac should allow more surgeons to perform IORT and to conduct clinical trials to confirm the present indications in cancers with high local malignancy.","2532":"The early steps of cellular radiation response have been investigated using a linear electron accelerator operated in a split-dose mode, in such a way that the time intervals between pulse exposures to relativistic electrons ranged from fractions of a second to a few minutes. The initial dose brought about large, synchronous changes in radiation sensitivity and generated a tetraphasic, W-shaped time-dependent profile of cell survival upon the second radiation exposure. While this time-related process was observed in most cell lines investigated, its kinetic parameters varied significantly from one cell line to the other. The number of DNA strand breaks (neutral and alkaline DNA filter elution) and the level of apoptosis (gel electrophoresis and flow cytometry) induced at the different phases of the time-dependent profile showed no relationship with the W-effect. It is presently hypothesized that mechanisms involved in molecular recognition of radio-induced lesions and initiation of genomic instability play a major role in this effect. Whatever the mechanism involved, the split-dose irradiation in the range of seconds enables dissecting the early steps of radiation response. The relevance of the W-effect to radiation therapy and technical drawbacks are discussed.","2533":"Recent advances have been made in the understanding of molecular events following cellular exposure to ionizing radiations, suggesting that new molecular targets could be used to modulate radio-induced cellular response, including genes and their encoded protein involved in DNA repair, signal transduction, apoptosis and cell cycle regulation. These potential molecular targets include some radio-induced cytokines and growth factors that could modulate radiation response in irradiated normal tissues (TGF beta). In addition, in order to increase tumor cell lethality after irradiation exposure, two promising approaches have been recently explored, including firstly the modulation of radiation-induced apoptosis via the transfer of genes involved in the regulation of apoptosis (p53), and secondly the modulation of double strand break DNA repair.","2534":"The potential tailoring of radiotherapy modalities to the biological characteristics of individual tumours and normal tissues appears to be an exciting way to improve the therapeutic, ratio in radiation therapy patients. Numerous assays have been proposed to provide the clinician with the biological information necessary to predict the outcome after irradiation and to guide the treatment prescription, but none of them has made its way to daily practice. Major difficulties are due to the technical burden of the procedures, the poor characterization of the assayed cells, and, moreover, the high complexity of tumour and normal tissues biology. The present paper reviews the present status of the assessment of tumour cells radiosensitivity, proliferation and oxygenation. Research remains extremely active in the field of biological predictors of response to irradiation. Future steps forwards are expected from progress in the available technologies, (re-)discovery of apoptosis and investigation of normal tissue tolerance.","2535":"","2536":null,"2537":"Radiation therapy is generally used as a surgical adjuvant in the treatment of soft tissue sarcomas. Postoperative external beam irradiation is the most commonly applied treatment. The majority of retrospective studies have suggested that radiation therapy could reduce the incidence of local recurrence. Radiation is recommended in case of deep tumor location, inadequate surgical margins and grade 3 tumor. A total dose of 55 to 65 Gy using large volume with initial field margin of 5 cm are recommended. Radiation therapy can also be delivered in preoperative fashion, but the majority of the studies have reported a higher wound complication rate. The value of brachytherapy for reducing the risk of local recurrence has been demonstrated in a randomized trial, especially for patients with high grade tumors. The combination of external radiation (40 to 45 Gy) and brachytherapy (15 to 20 Gy) seems to be the optimal adjuvant local strategy.","2538":"To elaborate a new classification of surgery of soft tissue sarcoma (STS). This was a multicentre study. Purely descriptive terms of surgery of STS have been established. The classification results in a synthesis of surgery terms and conclusion of the pathological report defining the resection (R): R0 = in sano, R1 = microscopic residual disease, R2 = macroscopic residual disease. Validity of the terms has been evaluated by questionnaire, first concerning previous operations, then prospectively during 15 months on the following operations. One hundred and seventy six operating forms established prospectively by eight centres were analyzed. The majority of surgeons were satisfied with the new items. Most of them judged the terms appropriate to surgery. In 96 cases, confrontation between the surgical terms and pathological items was made. Concordance between them was found in 2\/3 of the cases. Discordance was observed essentially in cases of re-excision. In all 96 cases the synthesis was judged reliable, permitting treatment adaptation. The study is ongoing. Following propositions of participants, modifications of the surgery terms are included. Subject to confirmation of these promising results, the proposed classification should contribute to optimize treatment of STS. ","2539":"Malignant tumors of soft tissue constitute a very heterogeneous group of tumors which is composed of more than 50 different entities derived from either the mesenchyme or the neuroectoderm. Diagnostic problems can be linked to the difficulty to firmly establish the diagnosis of malignancy and to the precise determination of the type of sarcoma. The prognostic is largely dependent on local and distant extension of the cancer. The study of the genotype of tumor cells has enabled the detection and characterization of genetic alterations. These alterations, frequently chromosome translocations, are specific markers for subgroups of tumors and can thus be of clinical relevance. These markers can be detected by cytogenetic, in situ hybridization or molecular biology techniques. The specificity of these alterations for tumor cells and the possibility to detect them with the highly sensitive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique have enabled development of tests aimed at the detection of tumor cells within potential metastatic sites.","2540":"The long-term results of external irradiation in locally advanced prostate cancer are poor: relapses are local or distant from infra-clinical disease present at diagnosis. Three clinical randomized trials have shown that hormonotherapy with LH-RH analogue with or without antiandrogen has improved: disease-free survival, local recurrence-free survival and metastasis-free survival (P &lt; 0.001). The EORTC trial 22863 has shown a significant improvement of the overall survival (P = 0.001), with an LH-RH analogue (goserilin acetate, Zoladex) was administered the first day of irradiation and then every 4 weeks for 3 years; for the RTOG trial 85-31 the same LH-RH analogue was administered during the last week of irradiation and given until relapse increases survival of patients with poor differentiated tumours with a Gleason score ranging from 8 to 10 (P = 0.03). Adjuvant hormonal treatment with an LH-RH analogue is recommended, but the optimal duration of the treatment remains unclear.","2541":"Prostate adenocarcinoma incidence are rising rapidly, especially in early stages. Even if some of these carcinomas may be latent or slow growing either spontaneously or under hormonal therapy, most patients 75 years old or less presenting a localized tumor, T1b-c, T2, T3, N0, M0, whatever the grading, will require treatment with curative intent: radical prostatectomy, external beam radiation therapy (ERT) and\/or brachytherapy. After ERT limited to the prostate or including seminal vesicles and\/or pelvic lymph nodes, the overall survival and the survival without clinical evolution at 5, 10 and 15 years are good. However survival rates without biochemical evolution are about 30% lower and 70% or less at 5 years for the more favorable group (T &lt; or = T2a and Gleason &lt; 7 and PSA &lt; 10 ng\/mL). Brachytherapy alone yields good results for the same favorable group. In the unfavorable group (T &gt; or = 2c and Gleason &gt; or = 7 and PSA &gt; or = 20 ng\/mL), adjuvant hormonal therapy improves survival. Conformal radiation therapy allows an increase in dose to the tumor by about 15% without increasing complications. It can increase the biological remission rate in the intermediate group (T &lt; or = 2a or Gleason &gt; or = 7 or PSA &gt; or = 20 ng\/mL).","2542":"Radical prostatectomy after pelvic lymphadenectomy is an effective treatment for patients with T1-2 pN0 adenocarcinoma of the prostate. However, pathologic analysis of resected tissue reveals that in 20 to 40% of clinical stage B lesions, the tumour has extended locally beyond the prostate. This infra-clinical disease may be the origin of local relapse. Radiation oncologists are often asked to deliver post-operative irradiation. There is sufficient evidence in the literature that postoperative radiation therapy can improve local control rate for patients with pT3 pN0 adenocarcinoma of the prostate; however, the effect of this radiotherapy on survival in this category of patients remains unclear. It is the reason why randomised clinical trials have been implemented for investigating the role of pelvic external irradiation with respect to the effects on local control, acute and late morbidity, overall survival and cancer-related survival, and for better defining the selective indications of radiotherapy, regarding pathological data.","2543":"Radical prostatectomy is the surgical curative treatment of localized prostate cancer. The survival is good in young patients (&lt; 70) with T2 N0M0 tumors and more than 10 year's life expectancy. Side-effects are urinary incontinence, impotence and anastomosis stricture. Quality of life should be considered as an important factor for the choice of the patient between radical prostatectomy, radiotherapy and follow-up.","2544":"Radiation therapy of benign diseases represent a wide panel of indications. Some indications are clearly identified as treatment of arteriovenous malformations (AVM), hyperthyroid ophtalmopathy, postoperative heterotopic bone formations or keloid scars. Some indications are under evaluation as complications induced by neo-vessels of age-related macular degeneration or coronary restenosis after angioplasty. Some indications remain controversial with poor evidence of efficiency as treatment of bursitis, tendinitis or Dupuytren's disease. Some indications are now obsolete such as warts, or contra-indicated as treatment of infant and children.","2545":"Medical literature is too prolific and user's guides are necessary to extract useful information for optimal treatment of our patients. The goal of this paper is to help doctors find relevant articles and to read them efficiently for applying the results to their patients. An excerpt has been written concerning the subject by the Mac Master team and the members of the Cochrane Collaboration in the JAMA, the BMJ and on the Internet: a web site is now devoted to user's guides to medical literature. Simple rules facilitating access to relevant papers and interpretation of the results have been given.

Thirty-three 4-month old rats were included into the study. Eighteen received whole brain irradiation (30 Gy\/10 fractions\/12 days), and 18 were given sham irradiation. Sequential behavior studies were done before irradiation and during the 7 months following irradiation. Significant decrease in memory function was observed in irradiated rats 1 month (p &lt; 0.001), 3 months (p &lt; 0.013), and 6 months (p = 0.007) post-irradiation. This was accompanied by learning deficit 1 month (p = 0.01), 4.5 months (p = 0.03), and 7 months (p = 0.009) post-irradiation. Response to radiation therapy observed in young rats differed from that observed in old rats. Young rats showed earlier decrease in memory function than old rats, but this deficit was followed by partial recovery. Learning deficits also arised earlier in young rats than in old rats. In two cases this deficit was permanent.

The various components, particularly staff earnings that are estimated for each procedure according to their category and working time, were cumulated for calculation of direct loads. Comparisons between direct expenses and the total amount of Z procedures led to the following results: the global cost is the same; at analysis of therapeutic procedures, however, this apparent similarity masks some very significant gaps; valorization of Z procedures is much lower than that of the corresponding real loads, especially when therapeutic procedures are quite different from techniques that are considered as \"standard\"; these differences do not apply to all the components of radiation therapy procedures. In particular, medical steps would be uniformly underestimated, while irradiation per se is overestimated. The authors suggest modifications of the general objectives and items of the nomenclature of radiotherapy and brachytherapy procedures. ","2553":"To reduce errors in the positioning of patients treated with external conformal radiotherapy for prostate cancer, we evaluated both the use of an immobilization device and new fiducial markers. The immobilization device consisted of an individual mold made of polyurethan foam. Two sets of skin markers located on the anterior tibial surfaces were used to identify the pelvic isocenter. The patient's position was evaluated by orthogonal port films which were then compared with the original simulation film. Results are presented with respect to orthogonal axes. Comparison with classic procedures without immobilization showed that use of the mold and new fiducial markers led to a decrease in set-up errors which were less than 5 mm. With the use of an immobilization device and optimized techniques for patients' positioning, conformal radiotherapy of prostate cancer is more accurate. ","2554":"Though Hodgkin's disease (HD) is one of the malignancies in which considerable progress has been made, long-term side effects have been observed, second primary cancer being the most significant. Several recent reports have indicated an increased risk of breast cancer (BC) in girls and young women among HD patients. In a retrospective multicenter analysis, 63 women treated for HD subsequently developed BC. Results that were obtained in 13 women (21%) who developed either synchronous (five cases) or metachronous (eight cases) BC were analyzed. The median age at diagnosis of HD was 19 years. Seven patients underwent exclusive radiotherapy (RT) (including \"mantle\" supradiaphragmatic irradiation) and six received concomittant radiation therapy and chemotherapy. The first breast tumor occurred after a median delay of 16 years. According to the TNM classification, we showed nine stage T0 (non palpable lesions), four stage T1, five stage T2, one stage T3, two stage T4 and five stage Tx BC. Seventeen infiltrating carcinomas, two fibrosarcomas and seven ductal carcinomas in situ were observed. Among 15 axillary dissections performed for invasive carcinomas, histological involvement was found in 10 cases. Seventeen tumors were treated by mastectomy and nine patients underwent conservative surgical treatment. With a 70-month median follow-up (range: 15-125), three patients developed locoregional recurrence and four other metastases. At present, eight are alive with no evidence of disease and one died of intercurrent disease. According to previous works, BC represents 6.3 to 9% of all second cancers occurring after HD treatment. The risk is higher in young women treated before 20 years of age, especially before 15 years of age. Factors that favour the development of secondary BC are: supradiaphragmatic irradiation, very young age at treatment, chemotherapy with alkylating agents, and probably genetic factors. We conclude that young women and girls treated for HD should be carefully monitored at least 10 years after the end of the treatment for HD, using clinical examination, mammography and ultrasonography. The optimal rythm of this follow-up is not yet clearly defined. Moreover, after multidisciplinary concertation, we suggest that secondary BC be sometimes treated by conservative radiosurgical approach. ","2555":"This pilot phase II study was aimed at determining the feasibility, toxicity, response rate, local control, and survival of concomitant chemotherapy with cisplatin-etoposide and radiotherapy in stage IIIA or IIIB non small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Between February 1992 and February 1994, 67 patients with either medically or technically inoperable stage III NSCLC were treated with concomitant chemoradiotherapy. Thoracic radiotherapy was administered to a median dose of 60 Gy over 6 weeks. Concomitant chemotherapy consisted of cisplatin 20 mg\/m2\/day plus etoposide 50 mg\/m2\/day from day 1 to day 5, every 4 weeks over four cycles. Medically operable patients were evaluated for surgical resection after a 45-Gy irradiation and two cycles of concomitant chemotherapy. Only 14 patients could undergo subsequent surgery. With a median 49-month and a minimum 34-month follow-up, the overall survival rate was 42% at 2 years, and 34% at 4 years. The median survival was 19 months and the actuarial local control rate was 57% at 3 years. Toxicity was mainly associated with myelosuppression and esophagitis, but could be treated and was of short duration. Concomitant chemoradiotherapy with cisplatin and etoposide at this dose level provides a well tolerated outpatient regimen that results in high local control rate and encouraging survival at 2.4 years. A similar regimen is being compared in a phase III trial including induction chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy. ","2556":"Brachytherapy has confirmed its prevailing role in conservative treatment of oral cavity carcinomas. To describe late toxicity in long-term surviving patients, comparisons with other series are necessary. Study of series of patients implanted for floor of the mouth or mobile tongue shows the need for more detailed data. Dental prophylaxy and lead protection of the mandibule, good indications and techniques of brachytherapy are necessary to avoid late complications. Some treatment factors have proved to be of good prognosis for late complications through multivariate analysis of large series treated with lr 192 wires, using the Paris system, eg, dose rate lower than 0.5 or 0.7 Gy\/h, intersource spacing smaller than 1.2 or 1.5 cm, treated surface less than 12 cm2, lineic activity less than 1.5 mCi\/cm, less than 1 cm diameter hyperdose, and use of mandibular lead protections. Tumor volume and location to the floor of mouth lead to higher risk of complications. Knowledge of treatment-related factors is important, with the development of new afterloading projectors allowing to control the dose rate and correct small inhomogeneities. High-dose rate exclusive brachytherapy is not recommended. More precise and reproducible classification should be used to report complications in series leading to publications in the future, thus allowing to compare results, reduce complication rates and improve the quality of life.","2557":"Moriz Kaposi was the first who, in 1872, described five patients presenting with \"sarcoma idiopathicum multiple hemorrhagicum\". In 1912 Sternberg termed this disease Kaposi's sarcoma. Since then various forms of this rare disease have been observed. In 1914 Hallenberg described the first cases of African or endemic Kaposi's sarcoma. In the 1960s the first reports discussing Kaposi's sarcoma following organ transplantation and immunosuppressive therapy were published. After 1981, the epidemic form associated with the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was described. All these forms, their history, treatment methods and the role of radiation therapy in the management of this rare malignancy are discussed, and the literature is reviewed.","2558":"","2559":"Retrospective analysis of the results obtained with daily interactive use of portal imaging for monitoring thoracic cancer radiotherapy. A Siemens electronic portal imaging system called Beamviewplus was used daily in 15 lung cancer patients for each X-ray field. Out of the 714 expected portal images, 585 (82%), were obtained and printed. We counted 94 errors in the 585 successful controls (16%). Four main classes of errors were identified: irradiation field placement (47 cases, 50%), shielding placement (30 cases, 32%) patient's position on the till examining table (14 cases, 15%), and selection of the energy (3 cases, 3%). Forty percent of these errors were potentially serious in terms of treatment volume and vital organ protection. Only portal imaging control could easily detect errors because they occurred randomly. We thus consider the use of this daily system helpful for patient management.

Between 1977 and 1994, 167 patients with a histologically proven adenocarcinoma underwent preoperative radiotherapy (median dose, 44 Gy; mean time before surgery, 5 weeks). Pathologic specimens were reviewed by the same pathologist in order to specify the modified Astler Coller classification (MAC) and to quantify residual tumor cell density (RTCD). According to the MAC, there were nine stage 0 (5%), 10 stage A (6%), 103 stage B1-B3 (62%) and 45 stage C1-C3 (27%) tumors. Seventeen per cent and 56% of the patients who received a dose &gt; or = 44 Gy presented with stage 0-A and stage B1-B3 tumors, respectively, compared to 4 and 69% of those who received a dose &lt; 44 Gy (P = 0.04). Tumor differentiation and a longer interval before surgery were significantly associated with more frequent downstaging. According to the RTCD, 62 tumors (37%) showed no or only rare foci of residual tumor cells; 62 (37%) showed an intermediate RTCD and 43 (26%) a high RTCD. No predictive factor of RTCD was statistically significant. Only post-operative staging was a significant prognostic factor (P &lt; 0.01). The favourable influence of higher doses of preoperative radiotherapy on pathologic stage has been observed. Tumor differentiation and time before surgery were the other significant predictive factors of tumor downstaging. Even after preoperative radiotherapy, post-operative staging retained its prognostic value.

Symptomatic radiation therapy can be delivered, but the best irradiation scheme is still unknown. Results of splenic irradiation in patients with myelofibrosis or chronic leukemia were retrospectively analyzed. There were 24 patients: 15 presented with MF and 9 with CML. Median irradiation doses were 9.8 and 7.7 Gy, respectively. The hematologic toxicity was moderate (except for platelets in the acute phase of the disease). No toxicity was observed. Various factors predictive of the response to radiation therapy are described. While high (around 14 Gy) radiation therapy dose appears necessary for MF and should be started before the increase in transfusion need, huge splenomegalies should be excluded in regard to CML. As for other cases, the optimal dose is still unclear, but should probably be high enough, ie, around 10 Gy. To further study and better understand biological mechanisms underlying response to radiotherapy in patients with MF, prospective radio-chemotherapy phase II trials should be conducted in both CML and MF patients. ","2565":"Macular degeneration is a major health problem. Less than 10% of the cases can be successfully treated by laser therapy. Low dose radiation therapy (in the range of 20 Gy) appears to decrease neovascularisation. These early results need to be confirmed through a randomized trial.","2566":"Glioblastoma cells appear to be inherently radioresistant and to present a significant fraction of hypoxic cells. The most significant prognostic factors to compare results achieved in several series of patients are the age, performance status and quality of surgical resection. Several randomized trials have provided evidence supporting the efficacy of radiation therapy in the treatment of glioblastoma. Prescription of a 60-Gy dose delivered according to a conventional dose-fractionation scheme (single daily fractions of 1.7 to 2 Gy five times per week) in a target volume with a 2-3 cm margin of tissue surrounding the perimeter of the contrast enhancing lesion on computerized tomography and magnetic resonance imaging is derived from observations made in several retrospective and prospective studies. Evidence of improvement in survival was observed neither in patients receiving hyperfractioned and accelerated radiotherapy, nor in patients for whom radiation sensitizers such as nitroimidazole compounds or halogenated pyrimidine analogs were associated to radiation therapy. The addition of nitrosourea to radiotherapy increases the 2-year survival rate by about 10%. Combination of full-dose external beam radiotherapy and brachytherapy or radiosurgery boost in selected patients with glioblastoma leads to an increase in the median survival, while external beam radiation alone in patients with similar prognosis does not.","2567":"Radiation is often necessary after pneumonectomy, either immediately or due to local cancer recurrence. High radiation doses represent a challenge due to the limited tolerance of the lung and the necessity of preserving and protecting the remaining lung parenchyma. The use of CT scan based-treatment planning allows delivery of high radiation doses. To evaluate the radiation tolerance of the lung after high radiation dose, we compared pulmonary function tests performed before surgery and after radiation therapy. Ten male patients (mean age, 56 years old; age range, 45-73) were irradiated after pneumonectomy for lung cancer. All patients had a CT scan-based treatment planning. The mean radiation dose was 56 Gy (45-66 Gy) delivered with a linear accelerator and multiple complex fields. Two or more sets of pulmonary function tests were available (before surgery and 2 to 6 months after radiation). No patient developed clinical radiation pneumonitis and most of the patients had a minimal paramediastinal fibrosis at CT scan. Postirradiation pulmonary lung tests were compared to the theoretical values of the estimated defect observed after pneumonectomy. No significant decrease in forced expiratory volume in 1 s\/inspiratory vital capacity (FEV1\/IVC) was observed in ten evaluable patients; the observed values were comparable to those expected after pneumonectomy without irradiation (FEV1\/IVC: 61 to 100%), showing that irradiation did not alter pulmonary function. Computerized tomography-based treatment planning and the use of complex beam positioning allowed optimal lung parenchymal preservation. Through this procedure, high doses of radiation can be delivered to the mediastinum and bed tumor. Comparison of pulmonary function tests performed before surgery and after radiation showed no alteration of lung function, even after high doses. Optimal tools required for the evaluation of radiation on lung parenchyma are still to be defined.","2568":"Mediastinoscopy is often necessary in management of lung cancer. Progress recently achieved in the field of thoracoscopy has led us to introduce videothoracoscopy as a complement to mediastinoscopy in preoperative management of such tumors. From June 1994 to June 1995, 113 patients presenting with stage I-IIIA lung cancer underwent a videothoracoscopy before surgery. No side-effects were observed. Results obtained in this study lead us to conclude that videothoracoscopy is useful before surgery of lung cancer.","2569":"This study was aimed at assessing percutaneous biopsy under computerized tomography (CT) guidance, its results in terms of diagnostic value, factors contributing to its complications or success, and its indications. Results obtained from a series of 41 patients and data from previous clinical trials were compared. Patients who were not eligible due to either poor physical condition or a tumor that could not be reached were not included into the study. Various factors, ie, the tumor location, the size of the lesion, the distance between the lesion and the thoracic wall, and the type (histological and\/or cytological) of samples, were analyzed. Results were evaluated according to the disease evolution or pathological findings. Tumoral cells were found in 23 samples. Eighteen samples were negative for malignancy, with eight benign lesions and ten false negative. Complications that occurred just after the biopsy were recorded. Failures and complication factors were analyzed and compared to those already described. CT-guided needle biopsy is an admitted alternative to thoracotomy, even for small nodules deeply located. The use of this technique should be discussed when fiberoptic endoscopy leads to negative results. Various tumors cannot be reached using CT-guided needle biopsy and this technique is more efficacious for bulky nodules. The thickness of lung parenchyma passed through does not seem to change the risk of pneumothorax. The use of laser guidance might help locate the tumor with more accuracy.","2570":"Analysis of the preliminary results of a phase I study investigating the feasibility of concomitant chemotherapy with daily doses of carboplatin (20 to 25 mg\/m2\/d over 45 or 10 min) and accelerated chest irradiation (60 to 64 Gy over 4 weeks, 2 Gy per fraction, using the concomitant boost technique). This combination was given alone or following three cycles of induction chemotherapy (cisplatin, 25 mg\/m2 per day from d1 to d5; 5-fluorouracil, 600 mg\/m2 per day from d1 to d5 and vinorelbine, 25 mg\/m2 per day at d1 and d5 with a 4-week interval) in 15 patients with locally advanced unresectable non-small cell lung cancer. All patients received the planned sequence. The dose-limiting toxicity was esophagitis (5 out of 15 grade 4). No toxic deaths were observed. The tumor response rate was high: six out of 15 complete responses and 14 out of 15 tumor regressions greater than 50%. The median survival was not reached after a mean follow-up of 14 months (range, 6-28 months).

Surgery included 507 pneumonectomies, 447 lobectomies and 15 segmentectomies (for patients suffering from respiratory failure). The rate of intrahospital mortality was 4.3%. The rate of crude survival at 5-years was 45.8%.

Several methods of desobstruction can be proposed, including brachytherapy. One hundred forty-nine patients presenting with endobronchial brachytherapy were included into the study. Seventy-three were treated with curative intent, 47 with palliative intent and 29 with a combination of external irradiation and brachytherapy. We usually delivered a series of two 7-Gy fractions (1 cm from the catheter), the treatment being repeated one, two or three times. When all symptoms were taken into account, respiratory function improvement was present in 79% of the patients. Among the 132 tumors that could be evaluated via a new endoscopy 2 months after treatment, 64 (48.5%) were in complete histological remission. The median survival was 14.4 months for the patients treated with curative intent. Eleven massive hemoptysies and 13 radiation bronchitis were observed. These results confirm the feasibility and good results related to endobronchial brachytherapy, though controlled studies are needed to better define its place in the therapeutic strategy of bronchial carcinomas. ","2573":"Retrospective analysis of 137 patients with limited stage small cell lung carcinoma who received radiotherapy between 1978 and 1990 and literature review. The population was divided into two groups according to the total dose of radiation delivered to the thorax: 45 Gy (1.8 Gy by fraction) or the equivalent irradiation dose administered by hypofractionation (group 1, 29 patients) and 65 Gy (1,8 Gy by fraction) or the equivalent irradiation dose administered by hypofractionation (group 2, 96 patients). The actuarial survival rate was 20% at 2 years and 9% at 5 years. It was 25% at 2 years and 17% at 5 years for 12 patients with surgical resection. For patients who did not undergo surgical resection, it was 20% at 2 years and 9% at 5 years for 96 patients belonging to group 2, while it was 14% at 2 years and 3.5% at 5 years for group 1. Deaths due to local relapse reached 48% in the group treated with 45 Gy and 33% in the group treated with 65 Gy (NS). For the 33 patients who were more than 70 years old at the time of treatment, the actuarial survival rate was 18% at 2 years and 6% at 5 years with death from other causes twice as high as that of patients who were less than 70 years old at the time of treatment. For the 59 patients who were less than 70 years old at the time of treatment, in whom supraclavicular node, pleural effusion or superior vena cava syndrome were not depicted and who were treated with the highest dose (4% of the total number of patients), the actuarial survival rate was 20% at 2 years and 14% at 5 years. Literature analysis shows that treatment of limited small cell lung cancer with chemotherapy and thoracic irradiation increased the overall survival rate from 16.5% to 23% at 2 years and the local control from 23% to 48%, in comparison with chemotherapy alone. Although these results are modest, they seem to be improved with more effective chemotherapy, especially with the association of radiotherapy and concomitant chemotherapy.

These trials were aimed at improving the local control in stage III non-small cell carcinoma with concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy in the CEBI 140 trial, and with concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy followed by local excision in the CEBI 142 trial. Thirty-four patients presenting with stage III non-small cell lung carcinoma were included into the CEBI 140 trial from December 1989 to December 1992. Patients were treated with a combination of daily cisplatin (6 mg\/m2 per day, 144 mg\/m2 in total), vindesine once a week (2.5 mg\/m2, 15 mg\/m2 in total) and bifractionated radiotherapy (60 Gy\/48 fractions\/6 weeks) followed by two cycles of cisplatin 120 mg\/m2 (at d18 and d45 after completion of radiochemotherapy) and three cycles of vindesine (6 mg\/m2 at d24, d31, and d38 after completion of radiochemotherapy). Twenty-eight patients presenting with stage IIIB non-small cell carcinoma-were included into the CEBI 142 trial since January 1993. Patients received a combination of cisplatin (100 mg\/m2 at d1 and d24, 200 mg\/m2 in total), vinblastine (4 mg\/m2 at d1 and d24, 8 mg\/m2 in total), 5-fluorouracil in continuous infusion (1,000 mg\/m2 from d1 to d3, and from d24 to 26, 6,000 mg\/m2 in total) and bifractionated radiotherapy (two series of 21 Gy\/14 fractions\/9 days, 11 days apart) followed by a new evaluation and surgical excision. In the CEBI 140 trial, all patients received a complete course of radiotherapy, but the dose of cisplatin was decreased in 27% of the cases, and the dose of vindesine in 88%. There were two toxicity-related deaths. Three months after completion of the protocol, there were 50% of complete responders. The overall survival rates at 1, 2 and 3 years were 53, 33, and 11%, respectively, and disease-free survival rates 21 11, and 11%, respectively. In the CEBI 142 trial the immediate tolerance was good. Twenty-one patients (75%) underwent surgical resection. Four tumors could not be resected. Resection was histologically incomplete in one case, and complete in the 16 remaining cases. With a median follow-up of 14 months, ten patients were alive and disease-free. Preliminary results of the CEBI 142 trial are encouraging. More patients and longer follow-up are needed for definitive conclusion. It would be of interest to implement a randomized trial comparing the CEBI 142 scheme and classical radiation therapy. ","2575":"As locally advanced and inoperable non-small cell lung cancers still have a poor prognosis, the present phase II study focused on the administration of concomitant chemotherapy and radiotherapy and was aimed at increasing both local and metastatic controls. Thirty-nine patients (36 male and three female patients, mean age, 56 years) were included into the study. Ninety five percent of them had a good performance status (OMS status 0 or 1). The histopathological analysis showed the existence of squamous cell in 64% of the cases. There was one stage I tumor, nine stage IIIA tumors and 24 stage IIIB tumors. In two cases, the tumor stage was unknown. The duration of each cycle of the protocol was 3 weeks and included the administration of cisplatin (50 mg\/m2 at d1 and d2) and fluorouracil (5-FU) (1 gr\/m2 in continuous infusion at d1, d2, and d3), and external beam irradiation (20 Gy subdivided into 2 Gy-fractions that were administered from d1 to d12); the 3rd week was a resting period. The tolerance to the treatment was good. Fifteen per cent grade 3-4 leucopenia, 3% grade 3-4 thrombopenia and 15% grade 3-4 nausea with vomiting were observed. No serious esophagitis was recorded. Chemotherapy was completed in more than 90% of the cycles. An objective response was described in 56% of the cases, with only 3% of complete responses. However, evaluation was done on average 6 weeks after radiotherapy, at a time where post-irradiation fibrosis could hamper radiological assessment. Median survival and 2- and 3-year survivals were 11.4 months, 27% and 14%, respectively. The only significant prognostic factor was the OMS performance status index, while the radiological response was particularly non-predictive of survival. Failure patterns were analyzed in 20 patients and consisted of the following: local relapse only, six cases; metastatic relapse only, 13 cases; both local and metastatic relapse, one case. The concomitant administration of 5-FU, cisplatin and external irradiation seems feasible in current clinical practice. Survival but not radiological response should be the only criteria to evaluate this type of association. Improvement in local control is not unlikely with this type of association. ","2576":"Several randomized trials have led us to address the usefulness of post-surgical external beam therapy (EBT) in non-oat cell bronchial carcinoma. Results that were obtained in a group of 374 patients submitted between 1977 and 1994 to identical therapy-the follow-up being done by the same team-and results of six randomized trials are analyzed. The tumor stages were the following: T1, 13%; T2, 56%; T3, 29%; and T4, 2%; N0, 31%; N1, 34%; and N2, 35%. There were 85% histologically complete resections. EBT was administered according to either the classical irradiation scheme (C) or as an 'equivalent hypofractionated dose' (H) in the case of complete resection. When resection was not complete, 60 to 65 Gy were administered according to a C or an H irradiation scheme. The irradiation scheme was C in 73% of the cases and H in 27%. The EBT technique has been chosen to ensure maximum lung sparing. Following a 45 Gy-irradiation with anteroposterior beams, orthogonal or, when necessary, oblique beams were used. Non homogeneity of the lungs was taken into account in establishing the treatment planning. The treatment file was collectively checked by the medical staff in 75% of the cases. EBT was indicated for N+(N1+N2), T3 and incomplete resections. The overall survival was 42% at 5 years and 27% at 10 years. The 5-year survival was 52% for stage I cancer (T1N0-T2N0), 60% for stage II cancer (T1N1-T2N1), 31% for stage IIIa cancer (T3N0, T1-3N2), 45% for complete resection and 30% when resection was not complete. Regarding the benefits of post-surgical radiotherapy, the analysis of the six randomized trials does not allow any conclusion. This might be due to either the insufficient number of cases, a follow-up time not long enough, incorrect radiotherapy, or insufficient available data. Comparison of the results pertaining to the six trials with those of our series shows an advantage for the current series, indicating that survival is likely to be improved if EBT is correctly done with regard to the dose, volume and technique used. ","2577":"The prognosis of inoperable non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC) is poor and thoracic radiation therapy is usually the main step of the therapeutic approach. The results of a retrospective analysis of a series of 381 patients treated from 1977 to 1990 for an inoperable NSCLC are reported. Three hundred and twenty two men and 59 women were included into the study. Their mean age was 66 years. A squamous cell carcinoma was observed in 276 cases (72%). A superior vena cava syndrome or a Pancoast's syndrome were present in 21 and 26 patients, respectively. Fifty-two per cent of the patients had a WHO performance status &gt; or = 2. According to the TNM classification, the tumor distribution was as follows: 11 T1, 153 T2, 175 T3, and 42 T4. The mediastinum was involved in 174 patients. All patients were treated by external radiation therapy with a total dose of 60-65 Gy. Classical fractionation of the irradiation dose was done in 217 patients and hypofractionation was used for 164 patients. After treatment, improvement of the superior vena and Pancoast's syndromes was observed in 90% of the patients. Radiological complete response was obtained in 177 patients (47%). The 5-year overall survival rate was 6.2%. No significant differences in survival according to the initial tumor size, the mediastinum status or the fractionation scheme were noted. The 5-year survival rate was 13% in patients with a tumor that completely responded to irradiation. Death was mainly due to local failure (231 patients, 69%) and metastatic disease (107 patients, 32%). The radiotherapy tolerance was acceptable. Although irradiation provides good palliation and a 10%-survival rate at 3 years, the results relating to radiation therapy were disappointing. ","2578":"To determine the efficacy and safety of induction chemotherapy followed by concomitant chemoradiotherapy in the treatment of stage III non-small cell lung cancer and whether the response to induction chemotherapy can predict the response to subsequent chemoradiotherapy and survival. Between December 1987 and June 1993, 46 patients with previously untreated stage III non-small cell lung cancer received every 21 days induction chemotherapy (ICT) including three cycles of 5-fluorouracil (600 mg\/m2\/d in short infusion from d1 to d5), cisplatin (15 mg\/m2\/d from d1 to d5), etoposide (50 mg\/m2\/d from d1 to d5) and hydroxyurea (1,500 mg\/d from d1 to d5). The first 21 patients also received bleomycin (3 mg\/m2\/d from d1 to d5). All patients received concomitant chemotherapy and had chest radiotherapy (CCRT). Patients received irradiation (65 Gy\/33-6 fractions\/7 weeks) on d25 after the third cycle of chemotherapy. Concomitant chemotherapy was composed of cisplatin (20 mg\/m2) and 5-fluorouracil (500 mg\/m2) that were administered each Monday and Thursday during radiotherapy. Maintenance chemotherapy consisted of thiotepa (10 mg\/m2) and methotrexate (10 mg\/m2) that were administered every 2 weeks for 6 months. Pulmonary toxicity was observed in four out of 21 patients who had received bleomycin and subsequently developed pulmonary fibrosis, leading to death for two of them. ICT alone produced five complete responses (11%) and 13 partial responses (28%). The combination of chemotherapy and radiotherapy led to 19 complete responses (41%) and 14 partial responses (30%). Eighteen of the 18 responders (100%) to ICT responded to subsequent CCRT, of whom 13 (72%) became complete responders. Fifteen of the 28 non-responders to ICT (53%) responded to CCRT, six of them being complete responders (21%) (P &lt; 0.001). The median overall survival rate was 17 months when considering all patients, 25 months in patients responding to ICT and 13 months in non-responders. The 2-year survival rates were 28, 55 and 11%, respectively (P &lt; 0.05). ICT did not influence the rate of subsequent metastatic events. However, locoregional reprogression was lower in responders to ICT. The number of metastatic events was not significantly related to response to ICT. By contrast, the rate of local failure was higher when there was resistance to ICT (75% versus 39%). Out of the 19 complete responders to CCRT (13 responders to ICT and six non-responders to ICT), four developed secondary locoregional reprogression (21%) and six developed metastatic disease (31%). In complete responders to CCRT, the rate of locoregional failure was 15% in responders to ICT (2\/13) and 33% (2\/6) in non-responders to ICT. Four out of the 13 responders to CCRT after response to ICT (31%) and two out of the six complete responders to CCRT developed metastatic disease after non-response to ICT. There is a statistically significant relationship not only between the response to ICT and the response to CCRT, but also between the response to ICT and the local outcome and survival.

In non-small cell lung cancer, radiation therapy alone results in disappointing long-term survival. Three recent randomized trials, however, have shown a limited but significant improvement of survival with induction chemotherapy, though local control remained poor in these studies as well as in small-cell lung cancer treated with chemotherapy and late radiotherapy. Two randomized trials focusing on small-cell lung cancer have recently shown significant benefit due to the combination of early concurrent mediastinal irradiation and chemotherapy, with major improvement in local control and a more than 40% 2-year survival rate. The concept of concurrent chemoradiotherapy has also been studied in non-small cell carcinoma with several pilot studies leading to both encouraging results and improved survival rate (up to 40% at 2 years).

Based on clinical and physical criteria, CAVCAV determines the geometric characteristics of the radiation fields (beam direction, location and shape of the shielding blocks) for the three stages of radiation therapy of nasopharyngeal carcinomas.

Reirradiation was proposed because of positive margins and\/or lymph node metastasis with extra-capsular spread. The planned reirradiation dose was 60 Gy over 5 weeks, with two daily fractions of 1.2 Gy delivered 6-8 hours apart. Of the 14 patients, 10 received the reirradiation scheduled dose (ie, 60 Gy). All patients experienced an acute mucositis that never led to disruption of the treatment. Ten patients died 3 to 41 months after reirradiation (mean: 14 months), three were disease-free 48 to 71 months after reirradiation and one was alive with local progressive disease 74 months after reirradiation. The overall local control rate within the reirradiated volume was 43%. The 24- and 36-month overall survival rates were 50 and 35%, respectively. Overall, 13 late complications were noted: four were grade 1, seven were grade 2, and two were grade 3. Three patients still alive in September 1993 and whose initial files were available were enrolled in an additional study to assess from dose-volume histograms the cumulative doses delivered by the two irradiations.

While postoperative radiation therapy eradicates residual disease in these tumors, preoperative radiation therapy may also decrease the tumoral volume in order to make surgery easier. The improvement in radiation modalities has allowed an increase in the treatment dose with minimal side-effects. Several clinical studies have demonstrated the efficacy of pre- or postoperative radiotherapy. The objective of the combination of radiation and chemotherapy is to increase the local control and decrease the metastatic process. Chemotherapy associated with postoperative radiotherapy leads to better results than surgery alone or radiation therapy plus surgery, in terms of overall survival rates and disease-free survivals. Encouraging clinical trials using the preoperative combination have permitted the implementation of phase III studies that are still in progress. Although optimal modalities related to chemotherapy are still not clearly defined, the importance of each modality is discussed, particularly in regard to the combination of radiation and chemotherapy.","2590":"Radiation therapy has been for years the treatment of choice of locally advanced non small cell lung cancer. Improvement due to the combination of radiation and chemotherapy has been shown recently through several randomized trials and a recent meta-analysis. These results may be explained by biological mechanisms, yet uncompletely explored, which are detailed in this review and applied to lung cancer. The optimal combination scheme is not yet defined, even though the concurrent approach is promising, at the expense of an increased toxicity which is the limiting factor of treatment escalation doses. Biological findings and future results of randomized trials will hopefully open new avenues in the therapeutic strategy of this poor prognosis disease.","2591":"Standard treatment for limited stage adenocarcinoma of the breast includes lumpectomy (or a quadrantectomy), axillary node dissection, regional radiation therapy and, if the prognostic factors are unfavourable, chemotherapy and\/or hormone therapy. This is supported by the results of American and European randomised trials. There have been many attempts at improving the modalities of conservative surgery and postoperative radiation therapy in order to maximize local control and minimize late sequellae. It is also likely that induction chemotherapy and external beam radiotherapy applied in selected cases increase the proportion of patients who can be offered conservative surgery."},"articletitle":{"0":null,"1":"Final results of the IFCT-0803 study, a phase II study of cetuximab, pemetrexed, cisplatin, and concurrent radiotherapy in patients with locally advanced, unresectable, stage III, non-squamous, non-small-cell lung cancer.","2":"[Endocrine side effects of radiation therapy: Diagnosis, prevention, and treatment].","3":"Survival impact of postoperative radiotherapy in patients with olfactory neuroblastoma: 513 cases from the SEER database.","4":"[Role of tractography in stereotactic radiosurgery and brain stereotactic radiotherapy].","5":"[Current management and perspectives for locally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma].","6":"Omentum flap as a spacer before carbon ion radiotherapy for gynecological recurrences.
