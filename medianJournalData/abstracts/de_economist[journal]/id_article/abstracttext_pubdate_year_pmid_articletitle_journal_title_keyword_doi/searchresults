We study the effect of the pandemic on demand for online grocery shopping specifically, using municipality-level data from a Dutch online supermarket. We find that an additional hospital admission increased app traffic by 7.3 percent and sales per order by 0.31 percent. Local hospital admissions do not correlate with the variety of groceries ordered, but online search behavior does, suggesting that hoarding behavior is driven by the general perception and impact of the virus rather than local conditions. Local COVID-19 conditions also have different effects in urban versus non-urban municipalities, with local hospital admissions increasing app traffic in urban areas but lowering sales per order as compared to non-urban areas. It remains to be seen whether the demand for online grocery shopping will permanently increase as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic.

","2":"This paper aims to analyze the determinants of cash usage in a selection of European Union (EU) countries over the 2003-2016 period, based on a set of technological, socioeconomic, and socio-cultural indicators and cost components. Our results reveal the existence of both common and region-specific determinants for the EU advanced and Central and Eastern European (CEE) countries. In both groups cash usage is determined by payment system characteristics. Additionally, in the EU advanced countries cash usage can also be explained by the level of economic development and income inequalities and proliferation of Internet. In contrast, cash usage in CEE countries is negatively associated with consumer confidence and is inversely related to the technological progress, expressed in terms of mobile users.","3":"We explore the impact of COVID-19 hotspots and regional lockdowns on the Dutch labour market during the outbreak of COVID-19. Using weekly administrative panel microdata for 50 per cent of Dutch employees until the end of March 2020, we study whether individual labour market outcomes, as measured by employment, working hours and hourly wages, were more strongly affected in provinces where COVID-19 confirmed cases, hospitalizations and mortality were relatively high. The evidence suggests that labour market outcomes were negatively affected in all regions and local higher virus case numbers did not reinforce this decline. This suggests that preventive health measures should be at the regional level, isolating hotspots from low-risk areas.","4":"We study medical progress within a two-sector economy of overlapping generations subject to endogenous mortality. Individuals demand health care with a view to lowering mortality over their life-cycle. We characterise the individual optimum and the general equilibrium, and study the impact of a major medical innovation leading to an improvement in the effectiveness of health care. We find that general equilibrium effects dampen strongly the increase in health care usage following medical innovation. Moreover, an increase in savings offsets the negative impact on GDP per capita of a decline in the support ratio. Finally, we show that the reallocation of resources between the final goods and health care sector, following the innovation, plays a crucial role in shaping the general equilibrium impact.","5":"Using panel data on the age group 50-70 in 15 European countries, we analyze the effects of providing informal care to parents, parents-in-law, stepparents, and grandparents on employment status and work hours. We account for fixed individual effects and test for endogeneity of caregiving using moments exploiting standard instruments (e.g., parental death) as well as higher-order moment conditions (Lewbel instruments). Specification tests suggest that informal care provision and daily caregiving can be treated as exogenous variables. We find a significant and negative effect of daily caregiving on employment status and work hours. This effect is particularly strong for women. On the other hand, providing care at a weekly (or less than weekly) frequency does not significantly affect paid work. We do not find evidence of heterogeneous effects of caregiving on paid work across European regions.","6":"In the traditional retirement scenario, individuals work full-time or part-time until a given age, and then stop working abruptly. From the individual's point of view, it seems more attractive to have a smooth transition, with gradual retirement. In Sweden and other European countries, specific gradual retirement programs have been created in the past 20 years, first in combination with early retirement programs and later to increase labour market participation of older workers. This paper surveys the existing literature on gradual retirement in the US and Europe and analyzes the relevance of gradual retirement in the Netherlands as a tool to keep people employed longer.","7":"The relationship between fertility and socioeconomic equity is explored by analyzing data from developing countries to assess the interaction between 4 variables: fertility, life expectancy, schooling, and income distribution.  The theoretical model, based on findings of many past studies, is presented, and the results of regression analysis of fertility and socioeconomic variables are tabulated and discussed.  The results indicate that life expectancy and schooling are major determinants of fertility.  Income equity, contrary to expectations, did not influence fertility very much; fertility, however, did affect income equity considerably.  Policy directions based on these findings are suggested and sources of data are cited."},"articletitle":{"0":"Correction to: COVID-19 and the Demand for Online Grocery Shopping: Empirical Evidence from the Netherlands.","1":"COVID-19 and the Demand for Online Grocery Shopping: Empirical Evidence from the Netherlands.","2":"What Factors Keep Cash Alive in the European Union?","3":"Regional Coronavirus Hotspots During the COVID-19 Outbreak in the Netherlands.","4":"On the Anatomy of Medical Progress Within an Overlapping Generations Economy.","5":"Informal Caregiving, Employment Status and Work Hours of the 50+ Population in Europe.","6":"GRADUAL RETIREMENT: PREFERENCES AND LIMITATIONS.","7":"Socioeconomic equity and fertility in developing countries: a block-recursive model."},"doi":{"0":"","1":"","2":"","3":"","4":"","5":"","6":"","7":""},"journal_title":{"0":"De Economist","1":"De Economist","2":"De Economist","3":"De Economist","4":"De Economist","5":"De Economist","6":"De Economist","7":"De Economist"},"keyword":{"0":"","1":"COVID-19Consumer behaviorFood consumptionOnline grocery shopping","2":"CEE countriesCash usageEuropean UnionPanel dataPayment instruments","3":"COVID-19Coronavirus hotspotsEmploymentLockdownWagesWorking hours","4":"Health careLife-cycle modelLongevityMedical innovationOverlapping generationsValue of life","5":"ElderlyInformal careLabor supplyPanel dataSHARE","6":"","7":"Demographic FactorsDeveloping CountriesEconomic FactorsEducational StatusFertilityIncomeLength Of LifeLife ExpectancyModels, TheoreticalMortalityPopulationPopulation DynamicsResearch MethodologyResearch ReportSocioeconomic FactorsSocioeconomic StatusStatistical Regression"},"pmid":{"0":34565808,"1":34253932,"2":34092801,"3":33896962,"4":32624586,"5":30996393,"6":20442794,"7":12310370},"pubdate_year":{"0":2021,"1":2021,"2":2021,"3":2021,"4":2020,"5":2018,"6":2008,"7":1980}}
