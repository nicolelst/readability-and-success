Dominican Republic (DR) has the second-highest prevalence of HIV infection in the Caribbean, but viral suppression and treatment adherence are not well understood. We conducted a cross-sectional study among people living with HIV\/AIDS(PLWHA) to fill in the knowledge gap. Questionnaire was used to collect demographic data, antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence, and barriers and facilitators to HIV care. Viral load and other clinical information were extracted through chart reviews. Descriptive analyzes and logistic regression were conducted to explore factors associated with non-viral suppression and imperfect ART adherence. Of 193 PLWHA 83.9% were virally suppressed. Those that were non-virally suppressed were more likely of being male (odds ratio [OR]: 2.55, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.17-5.58) and less likely of being unemployed (OR: 0.28, 95% CI: 0.08-0.96). However, being male (OR: 0.78, 95% CI:0.40-1.53) and unemployed (OR: 0.28, 95% CI:0. 08-1.21) were less likely to report imperfect adherence. Tailored interventions are needed to improve adherence and viral suppression in DR.","1":"Even though there are advancements in the treatment of patients with HIV, many deaths are related to undernutrition. Despite this fact, the burden of undernutrition and associated factors among adults receiving ART is a significant shortcoming in the study area. A cross-sectional study was done in public hospitals of the Bench-Sheko zone. Face-to-face interviews were used to gather information. Odds ratio with a 95% confidence level was used to identify determinants of undernutrition. The proportion of undernutrition, normal, and overweight were 29.2%, 61.2%, and 9.6% respectively. Food insecurity, poor ART adherence, low CD4 count, and substance use were factors associated with under nutrition among HIV patients. Undernutrition was so high in comparison to other studies in Ethiopia; the local concerned bodies should focus on identified risk factors for improving HIV\/AIDS treatment via health education, nutritional assistance and counseling.","2":null,"3":"Kidney disease is the fourth most common cause of non-AIDS-related mortality in people living with HIV. Combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) remains the cornerstone of treatment. However, little is known about the impact of cART on disease outcomes in patients with HIV-associated nephropathy (HIVAN) and HIV-immune complex kidney disease (HIVICK). This systematic review evaluates the impact of cART on progression to end-stage kidney disease (ESKD) and other outcomes in HIV-infected individuals. We conducted a literature search utilizing PubMed, and Cochrane database and 11 articles met inclusion criteria for analysis of which nine HIVAN studies showed decreased progression to ESKD or death for subjects when treated with cART versus those untreated. However, two studies showed no survival advantage with cART. Three HIVICK studies showed improvement in delaying ESKD in subjects on cART compared to untreated subjects. cART appeared to reduce the risk to ESKD or death in patients with both HIVAN and HIVICK.","4":null,"5":"In India, the nationwide lockdown was implemented from March to May 2020 due to COVID-19 pandemic. As of March 2020, there were 13.08 lakh PLHIV availing ART free of cost from Government run ART centres, To maintain the continuum of care, National AIDS Control Programme (NACP) of India adopted Multi Months Dispensation (MMD) through ART centres and Community Dispensation of ART through the various Targeted Interventions (TI) and Community Based Organizations (CBO). A mixed methods study was designed, with desk review of programmatic data, semi qualitative interviews of 250 PLHIV and 15 In-Depth Interviews of ART centre and TI\/CBO staff to document the process, strengths and challenges of these strategies in Surat city of South Gujarat. While administrative, technical and networking strengths were documented, manpower constraints, interrupted laboratory services, migration and relatively passive role of PLHIV in availing services were major challenges described in this study among several others.","6":"The Ryan White Program (RWP) in Miami-Dade County, Florida made several modifications to keep HIV care accessible during the COVID-19 Pandemic, including expanding telehealth services, increasing access to HIV medications, and waiving required lab tests for service recertification. We assessed ease of access to medical providers, medical case managers, and antiretroviral medications during the COVID-19 Pandemic among 298 Non-Hispanic Black, Hispanic, and Haitian people with HIV (PWH) served by the RWP Part A, Miami-Dade County, Florida using a telephone-administered survey between October 2020 and January 2021. Overall, most clients reported similar or better access compared to before the Pandemic. Use of videocalls to communicate with HIV medical providers varied by race\/ethnicity: Hispanics (49.6%), Non-Hispanic Blacks (37.7%), and Haitian clients (16.0%). Results suggest the modifications helped maintain access to care during an unprecedented health crisis. Permanently adopting many of these modifications should be considered to continue to facilitate access to care.","7":"Background: Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is the key determinant of virological suppression in people living with HIV (PLHIV). This study reports factors associated with non-adherence among PLHIV one year after introducing dolutegravir (DTG) based regimens in Tanzania. Methods: A hospital-based cross-sectional study was conducted in two health facilities in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, in 2020. Results: A total of 406 PLHIV were recruited, where the majority (73.4%) were females, with 94.6% of patients being on DTG based regimens. Factors such as refill interval and sharing of antiretrovirals had significant effects on adherence. Multivariate analysis found that patients attending care and treatment center (CTC) at Temeke Regional Referral Hospital (RRH) were 4.3 times more likely to have non-adherence compared to those attending Amana RRH (aOR [adjusted odds ratio] 4.3, 95% CI [confidence interval]: 2.38 - 7.91, p-value &lt; 0.0001). Conclusions: Sustainable adherence counseling is warranted to overcome non-adherence to ART.","8":"","9":"","10":null,"11":"","12":"Our aim was to examine the utility of the HIV Disability Questionnaire (HDQ), a patient-reported outcome measure for use in clinical practice from the perspectives of people living with HIV (PLWH) and healthcare providers. We conducted a qualitative descriptive study. Fifteen PLWH and five healthcare providers participated in an interview, of which ten PLWH participated in a follow-up focus group discussion. The HDQ has value in clinical practice, including its role in assessing disability, facilitating communication, tailoring treatments, and guiding referrals. Strengths of the HDQ included its comprehensiveness, relevance of domains, and importance of specific items. Concerns related to length of the HDQ, the potential for some items to trigger emotional response, and negative connotations with the term 'disability.' Recommendations for HDQ implementation included the importance of score interpretability, shortening the questionnaire, and tailoring administration to the individual. Results suggest the HDQ possesses clinical utility with PLWH and healthcare providers.","13":"Background: We aimed to determine the anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies among people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Pune, India. Methods: This cross-sectional study was conducted between March 2021 and June 2021. Demographic and clinical information related to coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) were recorded on structured questionnaires. Blood samples were collected and tested for anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies using commercial ELISA. Results: Of the 405 HIV infected individuals enrolled in the study, 223(55.1%) were females. Mean age and CD4 count of participants were 42 years (SD: 10) and 626 cells\/mm3 (SD: 284) respectively. A total of 382 (95%) PLHIV were virologically suppressed. The seropositivity against SARS-CoV-2 was found in 221 PLHIV (54.6%, 95% CI: 49.7-59.4). No significant association was found between demographic or clinical factors and seropositivity. Conclusion: A high prevalence of anti-SARS-CoV-2 IgG antibodies was found among PLHIV attending ART centre indicating an exposure to the virus among them.","14":"Objectives: This study examined factors contributing to decision conflict and the decision support needs of PrEP-eligible Black patients. Methods:The Ottawa Decision Support Framework (ODSF) was used to guide the development of a key informant guide used for qualitative data collection. Black patients assessed by healthcare providers as meeting the basic criteria for starting PrEP were recruited through the St. Michael's Hospital Academic Family Health Team and clinical and community agencies in Toronto. Participants were interviewed by trained research staff. Qualitative content analysis was guided by the ODSF, and analysis was done using the Nvivo. Results: Four women and twenty-five men (both heterosexual and men who have sex with men) were interviewed. Participants reported having difficulty in decision making regarding adoption of PrEP. The main reasons for decision-conflict regading PrEP adoption were: lack of adequate information about PrEP, concerns about the side effects of PrEP, inability to ascertain the benefits or risk of taking PrEP, provider's lack of adequate time for interaction during clinical consultation, and perceived pressure from healthcare provider. Participants identified detailed information about PrEP, and being able to clarify how their personal values align with the benefits and drawbacks of PrEP as their decision support needs. Conclusion:Many PrEP-eligible Black patients who are prescribed PrEP have decision conflict which often causes delay in decision making and sometimes rejection of PrEP. Healthcare providers should offer decision support to Black patients who are being asked to consider PrEP for HIV prevention.","15":null,"16":null,"17":"Background: Youth living with HIV in rural Rwanda experience poor clinical outcomes. In 2017, we implemented Adolescent Support Groups (ASGs), which provided economic incentives and peer support to youth aged 15-25. Methods: We assessed the ASG program using programmatic and electronic medical records. We described group composition and achievement on three indicators used to determine economic incentive levels: (1) quarterly pharmacy visit attendance, (2) biannual savings target achievement, and (3) annual viral suppression. Results: In total, 324 members enrolled in 34 ASGs. Group size and member ages varied more than anticipated. Groups performed well on pharmacy visit attendance (median quarterly group attendance range 91-100%) and on achieving savings targets (median biannual achievement range 80-83%). The viral suppression indicator could not be implemented as planned. Conclusion: To reflect contextual realities, adaptations in enrollment, indicator evaluation, and awarding of incentives occurred during implementation. Future research should assess whether these adaptations affected results.","18":null,"19":null,"20":null,"21":null,"22":"Although the concept of treatment as prevention has generated optimism that an AIDS-free generation is within reach, the success of this approach centers upon early diagnosis and linkages to care for people living with HIV. Unfortunately, people continue to present for HIV care at late stages of disease and HIV-related stigma has been recognized as the major impediment to HIV prevention and treatment efforts. Given the relevance of addressing stigma to improve access and utilization of HIV services among men, this secondary analysis assessed perceptions of heterosexual men in HIV-related stigma on HIV testing and ART services in Blantyre District. Purposive sampling was done with maximum variation which included men with unknown statuses, newly diagnosed with HIV infection and not yet on ARVs and those with HIV infection on ART. These participants were varied according to age and area of residency and included men from urban, semi urban and rural areas. Health care workers were included depending in the participation in the provision of HIV services. Eighteen (18 IDIs) and sixteen (16) KIIs were done at private facilities and a total of twenty (20) IDS and seventeen (17) KIIs interviews were conducted at public facilities and fourteen (14) FGD were conducted at public facilities as well. The data were collected from January to July 2017 and March to September 2018. Men perceived that there are barriers and enablers that influence men from accessing HIV testing and ART services. These factors include individuals, family, community and workplace. The surroundings can be a person, community and a family and it plays an integral part in ones' decision to get tested or initiate on ART. At all these levels, men would navigate the options of accessing the services while risking stigma and discrimination. HIV-related stigma exists and impedes access to HIV testing and ART services in men. Men preferred private hospitals to public facilities because of their ability to maintain respect to privacy and confidentiality to their client's. Imitating these policies into the public hospitals can help to improve the perception of HIV-related stigma in heterosexual men.

Due to the civil war, social and religious barriers, HIV prevalence is hard to establish, but it is generally believed to be increasing. This review (a) assesses the size and scope of the available literature on the HIV epidemic in Libya; and, (b) identifies the nature and extent of research conducted to date. A comprehensive search was performed using PubMed, Medline, Web of Science, ScienceDirect, Scopus, Academic Search Ultimate, Cochrane Library and Google Scholar. Primary research studies and official reports that are exclusively on Libya published during 1988-2021 were considered. In total 25 studies were included: Ten primary research studies, four online news articles, six Government reports, one letter to the editor, one manuscript, three online databases. Despite the low-quality data, the literature suggests there is an increase in HIV infection rates in Libya. Culturally sensitive research on sexual activities, women, HIV preventative methods and attitudes of the Libyan public will assist in developing an effective National AIDS Programme, reducing HIV stigma, supporting People Living with HIV (PLHIV) and decreasing infection rates.

HIV\/AIDS related services have been severely disrupted during the pandemic in different aspects. This paper highlights how privacy concerns affected HIV service provision during COVID-19 in Hong Kong, by sharing the experience of AIDS Concern Hong Kong. Based on our experience of working with our local MSM clients, temporary closure of center-based testing, venue-based testing in gay saunas, and mobile testing, meant that MSM could not easily go to a safe space to get anonymous and gay-friendly testing. To mitigate this, AIDS Concern Hong Kong put effort into promoting and making self-testing available during periods of testing center closure. We also made sure that people can choose to have test kits delivered to an anonymous pick-up station.","26":null,"27":null,"28":"Adolescents living with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) (ALHIV) globally, report worse treatment outcomes compared to adults and children on antiretroviral therapy (ART). We conducted a photovoice study with eighteen ALHIV to explore experiences and challenges of being on ART, and individual interviews with 5 health workers to describe the challenges in treating ALHIV. The facility implemented the Family club intervention to facilitate caregivers (parent\/guardians) supporting ALHIV on treatment. The health workers revealed that \"disclosing HIV status\" to children was the biggest challenge for caregivers and health workers. Participating ALHIV reported that family support and having a positive mentality were instrumental for continued treatment adherence. However, disclosure of HIV status to friends remained a challenge due to pervasive community stigma. Treatment fatigue and side-effects were also barriers to adherence. Family support was instrumental in facilitating adherence support for ALHIV. However, this (intervention) should include peer support to improve positive mental well-being in ALHIV.","29":null,"30":null,"31":"One in three people with HIV (PWH) has hypertension. However, most hypertensive PWH in sub-Saharan Africa are unaware of their hypertension diagnosis and are not on treatment. To better understand barriers to hypertension care faced by PWH, we interviewed 15 medical providers who care for patients with HIV and hypertension in northern Tanzania. The data revealed barriers at the patient, provider, and system level and included: stress, depression, and HIV-related stigma; lack of hypertension knowledge; insufficient hypertension training; inefficient prescribing practices; challenges with counselling; capacity limitations in hypertension care; high costs of care; and lack of routine hypertension screening and follow-up. Opportunities for improvement focused on prioritizing resources and funding towards hypertension care. System-related challenges were the underlying cause of barriers at individual levels. Strategies that focus on strengthening capacity and utilize existing HIV platforms to promote hypertension care delivery are urgently needed to improve cardiovascular outcomes among PWH.","32":"","33":"Fitness coaches need to understand the needs of people living with HIV engaged in community-based exercise (CBE) to be competent in developing exercises programs with this population. Our aim was to understand coaches' experiences engaging in a CBE intervention with PLWH in an urban center in Canada. As part of a broader study, coaches supervised weekly hour-long individualized exercise sessions with PLWH over a six-month period. Using qualitative longitudinal methods, we interviewed coaches up to three times over six months. Transcribed interviews were analyzed cross-sectionally and longitudinally. Seven coaches participated in 15 interviews. Developing confidence, improving health and experiencing a sense of community were viewed as key benefits to PLWH by the coaches. Challenges included accommodating the episodic nature of HIV and ensuring they felt prepared to work with PLWH. Understanding the experiences of coaches engaged in CBE can assist in tailoring exercise programs to meet the needs of PLWH.","34":"There is elevated prevalence of problem drinking among Russian women living with HIV and HCV co-infection. This paper describes the development and cultural adaptation of a multi-component alcohol reduction intervention incorporating a brief, computer-delivered module for Russian women living with HIV and HCV co-infection. The format and content of the intervention were adapted to be linguistic-, cultural-, and gender-appropriate using the ADAPT-ITT framework. A computer-delivered module and brief clinician-delivered individual and telephone sessions were developed. We describe the theoretical foundations of the intervention, the cultural adaptation of the intervention, and overview the content of the intervention's multiple components. Interventions to reduce alcohol use that can be integrated within Russian HIV treatment centers are urgently needed. If efficacious, the culturally-adapted intervention offers the promise of a cost-effective, easily disseminated intervention approach for Russian women living with HIV\/HCV co-infection engaging in problematic alcohol use.

Little is known about this population, their healthcare utilization and long-term outcomes. We conducted an 8-year retrospective review of PLWH with TE at a safety-net hospital. Demographics, clinical characteristics, treatments, readmissions, and outcomes were collected. We used chi-squared test to evaluate 6-month all-cause readmission and demographic\/clinical characteristics. Of 38 patients identified, 79% and 40% had a new diagnosis of TE and HIV respectively. 59% had 6-month all-cause readmission. Social factors were associated with readmission (uninsured (p = 0.036), Spanish as primary language (p = 0.017), non-adherence (p = 0.030)) and not markers of clinical severity (ICU admission, steroid-use, concomitant infections, therapeutic adverse events). Despite high readmission rates, at follow-up, 60% had a complete response, 30% had a partial response. Improving TE outcomes requires focus on culturally competent, coordinated care.","36":null,"37":"South Florida has the highest HIV rates across the country. Emergency Rooms (ERs) are optimal clinical sites for the identification of people living with HIV. We aimed to evaluate the feasibility and yield of opt-out HIV testing among ER patients in a large community healthcare system in South Florida, and determine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on HIV testing. This was a retrospective study conducted in the Memorial Healthcare System, Hollywood, Florida. HIV test was offered on an \"opt-out\" basis to patients aged 16 years or older presenting to the ER of the Memorial Regional Hospital between July 2018 and August 2020. Number of ER visits, HIV testing offered, acceptance of HIV testing, tested positive for HIV infection and linkage to care were reviewed and analyzed. A total of 105,264 (53.7%) patients of 196,110 ER visits were eligible for HIV testing and 39,261 (37.3%) completed HIV testing. Of those tested, 206 (0.5%) patients tested positive, with 54 (26.2%) new infected patients and 152 (73.8%) known infected patients who had not disclosed their status. 45 (60%) of 75 patients with known HIV infections who were not engaged in HIV care were successfully relinked into care after testing, and engagement in care increased from 50.7% pre-testing to 80.3% post-testing (p = 0.001). 45 (83.3%) of 54 newly diagnosed patients were successfully linked into care. During the COVID-19 pandemic, there was a significant reduction in both the ER visits and HIV tests as compared with the pre-pandemic period (p = 0.007 and p &lt; 0.001, respectively). An \"Opt-out\" HIV testing program was successfully implemented in a community hospital ERs. The use of this strategy successfully identified patients with undiagnosed HIV infection and improved their engagement in HIV care. Given the impact of COVID-19 pandemic on the testing program, new strategies should develop to reduce service disruption and maintain the progress of \"Opt-out\" HIV testing. ","38":"During the COVID-19 pandemic, HIV clinics had to transform care delivery for people with HIV (PWH). We developed a multifaceted telehealth implementation strategy and monitored number of out of care patients (OOC), medical visit frequency (MVF), gap in care (GiC) and viral suppression (VS), and compared measures to baseline data. Between April and October 2020, 1559 visits were scheduled; 328 (21%) were missed, and 63 (4%) were new to care. Of the remaining 1168 follow-up visits, 412 (35%) were telehealth visits. As of October 2020, there were 53 patients OOC, MVF was 55% and GiC was 24% compared to 34, 69% and 14% at baseline, respectively. Overall VS rate remained high at 93% (97% for telehealth and 91% for in-person visits, p = 0.0001). Our implementation strategy facilitated quick provision of telehealth to a third of PWH receiving care in our clinic. While MVF decreased and GiC increased, VS rates remained high.","39":"The level of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) transmission from mother to child in Indonesia ranks first worldwide. Newborn babies in Indonesia are at greater risk of experiencing the burden of HIV infection than babies born in other countries. To explore the full extent of Prevention of Mother to Child Transmission (PMTCT) in South Sulawesi Province in 2020 and to discuss program and policy implications for PMTCT. This is a health system analysis study with a qualitative approach using focus group discussion, in-depth interviews, and observations in primary health centers and hospitals. There is no local policy and guidelines for PMTCT programs and services; the coverage of HIV testing in pregnant women has not achieved 100% according to the target. There are limitations to human resources in public and private services to conduct the program. The assistance's activities to ensure antiretroviral (ARV) adherence are limited, and HIV-positive women faced stigma and discrimination, not only from the community but also from health workers. Some recommendations are to improve the HIV test coverage to 100% in pregnant women as well as the coverage and quality of ARV treatment.

To address this, researchers piloted Bijou, a program designed to provide health education through electronically delivered behavior and risk reduction modules. Participants were 29 YMSM aged 19-24 living with HIV from the southeastern US. Participants completed pre, post, and 3-month follow-up (3MFU) surveys assessing knowledge, intervention acceptability, satisfaction, self-efficacy, ehealth literacy, and usability. Findings revealed significant improvement in knowledge and e-health literacy from pre-test to post-test but lost significance at 3MFU. Self-efficacy scores did not show significant differences from pre-test to post-test or 3MFU. Participants who completed all modules considered Bijou usable and acceptable; however, many did not complete the program. Findings suggest a need for adaptations to promote knowledge retention, e-health literacy, engagement over time, and research with a larger, more representative sample.","42":"In Zambia, 84,959 adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) aged 15-24 are currently living with HIV. We explored the feasibility and acceptability of a 6-session, curriculum-based support group intervention designed to address key concerns of AGYW living with HIV. Urban Zambia. Surveys and in-depth interviews were collected pre- and post-intervention from participants enrolled from 2 health facilities. Eight participant observations of sessions were conducted. Descriptive statistics at baseline were reported only for AGYW who participated in the intervention (N = 21), while analyses comparing baseline and endline outcome measures were restricted to participants who had data at both time points (N = 14). Support groups were feasible to conduct and acceptable to participants. Co-facilitation by an adult counselor and peers living with HIV raised confidence about session content. Sessions on antiretroviral therapy (ART), disclosure and stigma, and grief and loss were most in demand. We did not observe significant differences in key outcome measures between baseline and follow-up. However, qualitative data supported the positive impact of the intervention on ART adherence and hope for the future following the intervention among our participants. A short-term, structured support group series holds promise for helping AGYW living with HIV safely navigate a complex time in their lives. ","43":"HIV prevention research among men who have sex with men (MSM) has traditionally focused on individual risk reduction strategies. Our study evaluated awareness, utilization, and preferences for 10 complementary HIV prevention strategies among 1,286 MSM recruited via Facebook and Instagram from June-August 2018. Ages ranged from 18-85 years, and the majority were non-Hispanic white (n = 1,019, 79.24%), college-educated (n = 819, 63.69%), gay-identifying (n = 1,074, 83.51%), and partnered (n = 808, 62.83%). Post-exposure prophylaxis was the least familiar option, and engaging in sexual activities other than anal sex was the most utilized option. Progressively older and bisexual-identifying MSM were less likely, but those with higher educational levels and easy access to local HIV resources were more likely to be aware of and to be utilizing a greater number of strategies. Additionally, Hispanic MSM were less likely to be aware of, and those in a \"closed\" relationship were less likely to be utilizing a greater number of strategies. In a subset of 775 multiple strategy users, pre-exposure prophylaxis, regularly testing for HIV, and limiting the number of sex partners emerged as the most preferred options. Combination intervention packages for MSM should be tailored to personal circumstances, including sexual orientation, relationship characteristics and access to local HIV resources.","44":"Fifty-four consecutive persons with HIV co-infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) and liver decompensation were treated with direct-acting antivirals (DAA). The HCV treatment was delivered using a multidisciplinary HIV-coinfection model of care integrating sub-specialty services in 3 countries. Of those treated, 91% (95% confidence interval, 80.1 to 95.9) achieved sustained viral response, and only one person died during treatment. Our study provides evidence that HIV providers achieve excellent outcomes when treating patients with histories of decompensated liver disease, with characteristics similar to those studied using a multidisciplinary HIV-centered approach.","45":null,"46":"WHO recommends hepatitis C (HCV) screening for all people living with HIV (PLHIV). Yet, HCV coinfection was shown to be rare in some Sub-Saharan HIV cohorts, and targeted testing was suggested more efficient for such settings. We studied HCV prevalence among Ghanaian PLHIV, and assessed the external validity of a score to guide targeted testing. This score was initially derived from a Cambodian HIV cohort, and uses as predictors: age, household member\/partner with liver disease, diabetes, generalized pruritus, AST, platelets, and AST-to-platelet ratio index. We enrolled 4,023 PLHIV, most from Greater Accra and Central regions, 28.4% were male, median age was 47 years, and high-risk behavior was reported to be rare. HCV seroprevalence was 0.57%, and HCV-RNA was detectable in 0.5%. Sequencing revealed genotype 1(b) and 2(q\/r) infections. The discriminatory performance of the score was suboptimal in the Ghanaian setting. The area under the curve was 0.69 (95% CI 0.59-0.79). HCV coinfection prevalence was very low in this Ghanaian PLHIV cohort with reported low-risk of onward transmission. To avoid the cost of screening all PLHIV in similar cohorts in resource-constrained settings, further research to develop better tools\/scores to guide targeted HCV testing is needed.","47":"Gay, bisexual, and other men who have sex with men (MSM) experience disproportionately high burdens of Human Papilloma Virus (HPV)-associated anal cancers. Recent focus has shifted to anorectal cancer prevention through high-resolution anoscopy (HRA); however, little is known about sexual minority men's perceptions, attitudes, or beliefs regarding HRA. We conducted 4 qualitative Focus Group Discussions (FGDs) (n = 15) with sexual minority men, focusing on their beliefs, attitudes, and perceptions of undergoing HRA. Participants discussed their experiences of HPV\/HRA as influenced by both their gender and sexuality, including unawareness of HPV disease as a male health issue, challenges relating to female-oriented HPV\/HRA language, conception of HPV\/HRA as related to prostate health, and connecting their sexual behavior identification as \"bottoms\" to their need for HRA. As efforts to improve HRA knowledge, access, and uptake among sexual and gender minority communities increase, special attention should be paid to language and messaging choices around HRA.","48":"Maintaining essential HIV services has being a Global challenge during the COVID-19 crises. Myanmar has 54 million inhabitants. Neighbor of China, Thailand, India and Bangladesh it was impacted by COVID-19, but came up with a comprehensive and effective response, following WHO recommendations. The HIV Prevalence is 0.58% and it is concentrated among key population. A HIV Contingency Plan was developed to face this challenge. The programme-based cross-sectional descriptive study with analysis of routinely collected data from MoHS data system, between 2019 and 2020 was conducted, comparing first six months of 2019 and 2020. HIV outreach activities and HIV testing were slightly affected after detection of first COVID-19 case, till mid May 2020. After that, outreach activities resumed. Introduction of HIV self-testing was initiated. 72% of more than 21,000 PWID on MMT were receiving take home dose up to 14 days and 60% of ART patients were receiving 6 months ARV dispensing. Essential HIV services were maintained.

We conducted a secondary analysis of a cross-sectional study assessing fertility desires and intentions of MLWH using a 5-point Likert scale based on the question: \"Being a father is important to me\". Logistic regression models were fit to calculate unadjusted and adjusted odds ratios (ORs) and confidence intervals (CIs) for significant correlates. Of the 276 respondents, 118 were heterosexual, 158 were gay, bisexual, 2-spirit, or queer (GBTQ), 55% had never parented before, and 65% wanted to parent. 191 (69%) respondents agreed that fatherhood was important to them. In unadjusted analyses, heterosexuality (OR 1.52; 95% CI 1.15 to 2.03), African\/Caribbean\/Black ethnicity (OR 1.57; 95% CI 1.12 to 2.19), African\/Caribbean birthplace (OR 1.48; 95% CI 1.06 to 2.05), and history of parenting (OR 1.60; 95% CI 1.10 to 2.39) were significantly (p &lt; 0.05) associated with importance of fatherhood. However, none of these variables were significant in adjusted analyses. From the unadjusted model, factors such as sexual orientation, ethnicity, and current parenthood may influence how MLWH value fatherhood, suggesting HIV and fatherhood is complex and must be explored further.","50":"As with other chronic conditions, adherence to daily medications remains a challenge for many individuals living with HIV due to structural, behavioral, and social barriers. Unfortunately, high levels of adherence to antiretroviral therapy are required to maintain virologic suppression. Alternative approaches are being explored to decrease the burden of daily pill administration, including long-acting injectable, oral, and implantable products. Phase 3 data support the efficacy of nanoformulated injectable cabotegravir and rilpivirine for HIV treatment in patients with undetectable viremia, but we have yet to learn how this strategy may benefit those with medication adherence challenges. Despite this, the affected community and HIV providers are very interested in exploring the role of long-acting therapies to address some types of barriers to medication adherence. This review summarizes available information about the potential for long-acting therapy to improve adherence for some patients and outlines associated opportunities and challenges with the implementation of long-acting therapy for the treatment and prevention of HIV.","51":"Chronic pain among people with HIV (PWH) is a driving factor of emergency department (ED) utilization, and it is often treated with chronic opioid therapy (COT). We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of a prospective observational cohort of PWH on COT at 2 hospital-based clinics to determine whether COT-specific factors are associated with ED utilization among PWH. The primary outcome was an ED visit within 12 months after study enrollment. We used stepwise logistic regression including age, gender, opioid duration, hepatitis C, depression, prior ED visits, and Charlson comorbidity index. Of 153 study participants, n = 69 (45%) had an ED visit; 25% of ED visits were pain-related. High dose opioids, benzodiazepine co-prescribing, and lack of opioid treatment agreements were not associated with ED utilization, but prior ED visits (p = 0.002), depression (p = 0.001) and higher Charlson comorbidity score (p = 0.003) were associated with ED utilization. COT-specific factors were not associated with increased ED utilization among PWH.","52":"In Canada, women make up 25% of the prevalent HIV cases and represent an important population of those living with HIV, as a high proportion are racialized and systemically marginalized; furthermore, many have unmet healthcare needs. Using the knowledge-to-action framework as an implementation science methodology, we developed the \"Women-Centred HIV Care\" (WCHC) Model to address the needs of women living with HIV. The WCHC Model is depicted in the shape of a house with trauma- and violence-aware care as the \"foundation\". Person-centred care with attention with attention to social determinants of health and family make up the \"first\" floor. Women's health (including sexual and reproductive health and rights) and mental and addiction health care are integrated with HIV care, forming the \"second\" floor. Peer support, leadership, and capacity building make up the \"roof\". To address the priorities of women living with HIV in all their diversity and across their life course, the WCHC Model should be flexible in its delivery (e.g., single provider, interdisciplinary clinic or multiple providers) and implementation settings (e.g., urban, rural).","53":"The needs of people living with HIV (PLWH) who have access to antiretroviral therapy have shifted from hospital to community care; however, little is known about physiotherapy within HIV community-based care. Our aim was to understand strengths and challenges of implementing physiotherapy within an interprofessional HIV day health program in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using semi-structured interviews. Data were analyzed using inductive content analysis. Fifteen PLWH and 5 healthcare providers participated. Strengths included improved access to physiotherapy and fulfilling an unmet need for rehabilitation; a tailored approach to physiotherapy; co-location improved communication, coordination, and engagement in care; and improved health outcomes for PLWH (i.e. function, psychosocial outcomes, and quality of life). Challenges related to managing expectations; variable attendance at visits; and managing complex and diverse needs of PLWH. Results may be transferable to other community-based care settings that provide care for PLWH and complex multi-morbidity.","54":"In Ghana, the HIV prevalence among MSM is more than 10 times greater than the general population of adults, and rates of engagement in HIV medical care are low among MSM diagnosed with HIV. Using structured surveys, we investigated the impact of HIV-related stigma, same-sex behavior stigma, and gender nonconformity stigma on linkage to HIV care (LTC) in MSM (N = 225) living with HIV in Ghana. Autonomy-supportive healthcare climate (OR = 1.63, p &lt; .01), vicarious HIV stigma (OR = 2.73, p &lt; .01), and age (OR = 1.06, p &lt; .004) predicted LTC. Conversely, felt normative HIV stigma negatively predicted LTC (OR = 0.65, p &lt; .05). Finally, we identified regional disparities, with MSM from Takoradi being 4 times and 5 times more likely to be LTC compared to Kumasi and Accra, respectively. Our findings highlight the nuanced roles of stigmas in shaping the HIV care continuum among MSM living with HIV, while revealing potential gaps in current measures of HIV-related stigma.","55":"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) and psychosocial support to manage stigma and disclosure is essential for adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV). Peer support groups can help ALHIV and their families live successfully with HIV. This qualitative study aimed to examine adolescent and caregiver perspectives on peer support groups. Three themes emerged: (1) peer support encouraged adherence to ART, (2) serostatus disclosure outside the family was perceived as difficult, and (3) the peer support group fostered fundamental and meaningful peer relationships for ALHIV. Caregivers felt peer support groups increased self-acceptance and adherence for ALHIV across 3 domains: (1) as motivation for families and adolescents, (2) to increase adolescent independence and maturity, and (3) to help adolescents accept their HIV status and live successfully with HIV. These data highlight the importance of psychosocial support groups for ALHIV and caregivers, illustrating the benefits of a safe space with trusted relationships and open communication.","56":"Long-acting injectable (LAI) antiretroviral therapy (ART) may offer persons living with HIV (PLWH) an attractive alternative to pill-based treatment options, yet acceptability data remain scant, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. We conducted 6 focus group discussions with PLWH, including key stake holder groups, and analyzed data with content analysis. Initial reactions to the idea of LAI-ART were often positive. The primary advantages voiced were potential to facilitate improved adherence and alleviate the burden of daily pill-taking while avoiding inadvertent disclosure and HIV stigma. Potential side effects were a particular concern of the women. Most participants preferred clinic-based administration over self-injections at home due to concerns about safety, privacy, and potential need for refrigeration. LAI-ART may be acceptable in Kenya, provided injections are infrequent and delivered in a clinic setting. However, HIV stigma, fear of potential side effects, and limited clinical capacity would need to be addressed. ","57":null,"58":"Post-marketing data have demonstrated the potential for weight gain with integrase inhibitors (INSTI) use in antiretroviral (ART) therapy. A medical chart review evaluated virologically suppressed adult prisoners living with HIV and on a non-INSTI regimen before switching or adding an INSTI. Primary outcome assessed average weight change; Secondary outcomes evaluated change in body mass index (BMI), fasting lipid panel, and development of hypertension. Statistical analysis included paired t-tests and descriptive statistics. Among 103 study participants, 95% were men with a median age of 44 years. Each INSTI was associated with an average weight increase of 4.3 kg (p &lt; 0.025). Bictegravir and dolutegravir were also associated with significant increases in BMI, +1.4kg\/m2 and +2.8kg\/m2, respectively (p = 0.011 and p = 0.001). Patients receiving HIV care in a correctional setting and on INSTI-based treatments experienced weight gain and increases in BMI. Future research should focus on the mechanism of development and interventions to prevent weight gain. ","59":"This qualitative longitudinal study examined the experiences of people living with HIV who engaged in a structured community-based exercise (CBE) program under the supervision of a fitness coach. Twenty people living with HIV were invited to participate in 3 semi-structured interviews over time. Participants engaged in exercise 3 times per week for 6 months with one weekly session supervised by a coach. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed verbatim and underwent longitudinal thematic analyses. Eleven participants were included representing a total of 30 interviews. Participants valued their experiences with the CBE program, particularly the motivation provided by the coach. Concerns about the environment, stigma and episodic health challenges affected their overall experience. To foster independence and promote self-management, health providers should consider these findings when encouraging CBE with people living with HIV. It is important to understand their goals and offer a variety of exercise options to meet their needs.","60":"Integration of Early Infant Diagnosis(EID) of HIV into Village Health Clinics (VHCs) would increase the uptake of services. This study assessed mothers and health care workers' acceptability of integration of EID of HIV services into VHCs in Ntcheu, Malawi. We conducted an exploratory qualitative study in the phenomenological tradition among 20 mothers of either HIV exposed or non-exposed infants and 18 health care workers (HCWs) from February to July 2019. We analyzed the data using a thematic approach and guided by the theoretical framework for acceptability. There were positive perceptions of the integration of services. Acceptability is influenced by attitudes, perceived burden, intervention coherent services, and perceived effectiveness of services. The successful integration of EID of HIV into VHCs requires strengthening of the health system and community awareness. Efforts to mitigate stigma should be prioritized when integrating the services to optimize uptake of the services at a community level.","61":"Women living with HIV (WLWH) experience depression, anxiety, and posttraumatic stress symptoms at higher rates than their male counterparts and more often than HIV-unaffected women. These mental health issues affect not only the well-being and quality of life of WLWH, but have implications for HIV management and transmission prevention. Despite these ramifications, WLWH are under-treated for mental health concerns and they are underrepresented in the mental health treatment literature. In this review, we illustrate the unique mental health issues faced by WLWH such as a high prevalence of physical and sexual abuse histories, caregiving stress, and elevated internalized stigma as well as myriad barriers to care. We examine the feasibility and outcomes of mental health interventions that have been tested in WLWH including cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness-based interventions, and supportive counseling. Future research is required to address individual and systemic barriers to mental health care for WLWH.","62":"FLEX is a Motivational Interviewing, home-based coaching program that concurrently targets HIV-related and physical activity goals among African American youth living with HIV in the United States. To create and pilot test FLEX, we leveraged a 2-step exploratory sequential mixed methods design informed by the ORBIT model with initial qualitative work followed by pre-post analysis of quantitative outcomes, concluding with qualitative exit surveys. Data were evaluated pre- and 3-months post-intervention. Recruitment was 90%. Participants reported high program satisfaction and program adherence (76% completion rate). Preliminary findings indicate reductions in participants' viral loads and improvements across 4 measures of physical activity.","63":"The implication and clinical significance of low-level viremia (LLV) in HIV patients are still not clear. This study aimed to characterize the clinical outcomes and to evaluate whether LLV could predict future virological failure in a well-defined cohort of HIV-infected Omani patients attending a large HIV clinic. Patients on regular antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least 12 months, and had at least 2 HIV RNA measurements 1 year after starting ART, were prospectively enrolled in a cohort study. LLV was defined as plasma HIV RNA between 50-200 copies\/mL that persists after at least 2 consecutive measurements after 12 months of ART. Multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression model was used to measure the association among virological failure, LLV and potential predictors. After 12 months of starting ART, 60 patients (40%) had undetectable viral load (UVL) &lt; 50 copies\/mL, while 37 patients (24%) had LLV and 53 patients (35%) had primary virological failure &gt; 200 copies\/mL. The incidence rates of subsequent secondary virological failure for UVL and LLV groups, were 3 and 7 cases per 1000 patient-months, respectively. Compared to UVL group, LLV group had increased risk of subsequent secondary virological failure with hazard ratio of (4.437 [95% CI, 1.26-15.55]; p = 0.02). Age, duration of HIV infection, pretreatment HIV RNA level, pretreatment CD4+ cell count, and ART adherent were associated with subsequent secondary virological failure. Collectively, Omani HIV patients with LLV were at a higher risk for HIV virological failure, and should be monitored closely. Further studies are need to assess whether ART modification in LLV patients would lower the risk of virological failure. ","64":"Patient acceptance of long-acting injectable antiretroviral (LAI-ARV) HIV-1 regimens will determine uptake. Although previous literature reports high satisfaction, these data stem from clinical trials subject to selection bias. This cross-sectional survey from the HIV practices of an urban academic medical center assessed perceptions and preferences using Likert scales toward overall acceptability, proposed frequencies, injection-site reaction durations, and distribution venue. 59% of surveys were completed resulting 202 respondents. 60% were male, 72% black, and the median age was 49 (IQR 36-58). 93% reported a once daily tablet frequency, 69% reported single tablet regimens, and 59% reported missing zero doses in the prior 30 days. Patients self-categorized as likely (57%) or unlikely (43%) to accept LAI-ARV. Both decreasing frequencies between injections and durations of injection-site reactions resulted higher acceptability scores. 57% of respondents preferred receiving an injectable from their clinician's office over other potential options. These data demonstrate positive LAI-ARV acceptance potential.","65":"The study aimed to see predictors of undernourished and its implication towards HIV continuum care. unmatched case-control study was conducted among 678 individuals in Jimma zone, southwest Ethiopia. Randomly selected data of 339 PLWHA who had poor nutritional outcomes (cases) and 339 without undernourished (controls) were analyzed. Logistic regression was used to identify forecasters of undernutrition. The quantitative results were supplemented from key informants who work closely on HIV care, then data were coded and analyzed thematically. Rural residence (AOR:1.8; 95% CI: 1.2, 6.4), female (AOR: 2.9; 95% CI: 1.1, 4.3), unstable livelihood (AOR: 5.1; 95% CI: 4.2, 19.6), low meal frequency (AOR: 6.6; 95% CI: 5.2, 21.1), less diversified foods (AOR: 3.5; 95% CI: 1.2, 14.3), and advanced WHO clinical stage (AOR: 4.3; 95% CI: 3.6, 13.7) and were found to be independent predictors of undernourishment. No social support advanced clinical stage, and unstable livelihood adversely affect nutritional status of PLWHA from the qualitative data. The socio-cultural, economic, and health-system factors inhibit ideal patient nutritional status. Better tracking, enhanced livelihood and social support along with drug therapy, food aid needs to consider for PLWHA. ","66":"This study assessed the predictors of self-esteem among Adolescents Living with HIV (ALHIV) in Ghana seeking healthcare at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital. A cross-sectional study was employed in sampling 139 adolescents using a purposive sampling technique. Rosenberg's rating scale was used in assessing the self-esteem of the participants. A total of 139 adolescents made up of 78 (56.12%) females and 61 (43.88%) males were recruited. Low self-esteem was reported among 66 (47.00%) of the adolescents. Adolescents aged 17-19 years (aOR = 2.97, 95%CI = 1.34-6.56, p = 0.007) were significantly associated with low self-esteem. The occurrence of low self-esteem among ALHIV was high and more pronounced among those in age cohorts of 17 to 19 years. Social support interventions designed which includes psychosocial support, life skills training, and avenue for discussing sexual and reproductive health matters could improve self-esteem. ","67":"Multiple simultaneous opportunistic infections in Human Immunodeficiency virus-1\/Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV-1\/AIDS) is a known and dreaded occurrence that often leads to poor outcomes. We present a case of disseminated aspergillosis and active Hepatitis-B virus (HBV) infection in such a host, where cell free DNA (cfDNA) next generation sequencing (NGS) of plasma was used to expedite diagnosis. Bronchoscopy was avoided and treatment was started expeditiously. In this case report we discuss the interpretation of the cfDNA NGS, and its potential role for early diagnosis and avoidance of invasive testing.","68":"The need for HIV testing in US emergency departments (EDs) has not been assessed, particularly among Latino immigrants and Blacks. We surveyed Latino immigrant and Black 18 to 64-year-old patients at 4 EDs about demographic characteristics, HIV testing history, and health literacy. A subset of patients was further surveyed on HIV risk-taking behaviors. Of the 2,265 participants, 24% had never been tested for HIV. Latino immigrants were more likely than Blacks never to have been tested for HIV (28% vs. 16%). In multivariable logistic regression, for Latino immigrants, male gender and lower health literacy were associated with no previous HIV testing. Among the 1,141-participant subset providing HIV risk-taking behavior data, 23% reported at least one risk factor and of those with at least one risk factor, 23% had never been tested for HIV. There remains a need for HIV testing among adult Latino immigrant and Black patients in US EDs.","69":"Stigma and discrimination are one of the important challenges in coping with HIV infection. Stigma and discrimination are universal phenomenon for the epidemic of HIV and exposure to people with HIV. The present study aimed to develop and measure psychometrically the HIV\/AIDS Stigma and discrimination scale from the general population viewpoint in southeast Iran. Data collection lasted from May to September 2016. The results showed that the \"HIV\/AIDS Stigma and discrimination scale\" had an acceptable internal consistency and stability (Cronbach's alpha coefficient = 0.69, omega coefficient = 0.7, and r = 0.57, p = 0.001). The scale had acceptable content and face validities. The Principal Axis Factoring (PAF) with varimax rotation analysis shows that the scale has 4 dimensions: \"patient social position\" (5 items), \"social support\" (4 items), \"social disease perspective\" (7 items), and \"social harassment\" (2 items). In general, the psychometric properties of \"HIV\/AIDS Stigma and discrimination scale\" are acceptable, and this scale can be used in studies.","70":"With the rapid scale-up of antiretroviral therapy (ART) to treat HIV infection, there are ongoing concerns regarding probable emergence and transmission of HIV drug resistance (HIVDR) mutations. This scale-up has to lead to an increased need for routine HIVDR testing to inform the clinical decision on a regimen switch. Although the majority of wet laboratory processes are standardized, slow, labor-intensive data transfer and subjective manual sequence interpretation steps are still required to finalize and release patient results. We thus set out to validate the applicability of a software package to generate HIVDR patient results from raw sequence data independently. We assessed the performance characteristics of Hyrax Bioscience's Exatype (a sequence data to patient result, fully automated sequence analysis software, which consolidates RECall, MEGA X and the Stanford HIV database) against the standard method (RECall and Stanford database). Exatype is a web-based HIV Drug resistance bioinformatic pipeline available at sanger.exatype.com. To validate the exatype, we used a test set of 135 remnant HIV viral load samples at the National HIV Reference Laboratory (NHRL). We analyzed, and successfully generated results of 126 sequences out of 135 specimens by both Standard and Exatype software. Result production using Exatype required minimal hands-on time in comparison to the Standard (6 computation-hours using the standard method versus 1.5 Exatype computation-hours). Concordance between the 2 systems was 99.8% for 311,227 bases compared. 99.7% of the 0.2% discordant bases, were attributed to nucleotide mixtures as a result of the sequence editing in Recall. Both methods identified similar (99.1%) critical antiretroviral resistance-associated mutations resulting in a 99.2% concordance of resistance susceptibility interpretations. The Base-calling comparison between the 2 methods had Cohen's kappa (0.97 to 0.99), implying an almost perfect agreement with minimal base calling variation. On a predefined dataset, RECall editing displayed the highest probability to score mixtures accurately 1 vs. 0.71 and the lowest chance to inaccurately assign mixtures to pure nucleotides (0.002-0.0008). This advantage is attributable to the manual sequence editing in RECall. The reduction in hands-on time needed is a benefit when using the Exatype HIV DR sequence analysis platform and result generation tool. There is a minimal difference in base calling between Exatype and standard methods. Although the discrepancy has minimal impact on drug resistance interpretation, allowance of sequence editing in Exatype as RECall can significantly improve its performance. ","71":"While Haiti has scaled up use of antiretroviral therapy (ART), current studies suggest sub-optimal adherence threatens long-term viral suppression in this understudied setting. Patient-provider communication (PPC) and information, motivation, and behavioral skills (IMB) have been implicated in ART adherence globally. However, no studies have examined their relevance in Haiti. The present mixed-methods study utilized cross-sectional survey data from 128 ART-initiating patients at 2 large HIV treatment sites in Haiti, as well as observational data from 12 clinic visits, to document associations between adherence-related PPC and IMB. Multivariate regression analyses suggested that PPC is associated with IMB constructs. At the bivariate level, more effective PPC was associated with higher levels of adherence-related information and motivation, but not behavioral skills. Observational findings indicate infrequent and non-collaborative adherence support. Taken together, findings lay the groundwork for additional research in the area of PPC, IMB, and ART adherence in Haiti.","72":"An estimated 166,155 individuals in the United States have undiagnosed HIV infection. We modeled the numbers of HIV-infected individuals who could be diagnosed in clinical and community settings by broadly implementing HIV screening guidelines. United States. We modeled testing for general population (once lifetime) and high-risk populations (annual): men who have sex with men, people who inject drugs, and high-risk heterosexuals. We used published data on HIV infections, HIV testing, engagement in clinical care, and risk status disclosure. In clinical settings, about 76 million never-tested low-risk and 2.6 million high-risk individuals would be tested, yielding 36,000 and 55,000 HIV diagnoses, respectively. In community settings, 30 million low-risk and 4.4 million high-risk individuals would be tested, yielding 75,000 HIV diagnoses. HIV testing in clinical and community settings diagnoses similar numbers of individuals. Lifetime and risk-based testing are both needed to substantially reduce undiagnosed HIV. ","73":"Patients who use post-exposure prophylaxis (PEP) are at ongoing risk for HIV acquisition after completing PEP. While the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) use immediately after PEP, some practitioners are hesitant to offer PEP-to-PrEP (PEP2PrEP). We began offering PEP2PrEP in the sexually transmitted infection clinic in Ottawa, Canada on August 5, 2018. During the first 16 months of PEP2PrEP, 61 patients requested PEP and 46 were initiated; 30 of these patients agreed to PEP2PrEP and 26 followed through. None of our PEP patients had confirmed HIV exposures; all fulfilled the initiation criterion of condomless anal sex with a male partner of unknown HIV-status. During the study, the number of PEP requests and initiations was statistical unchanged, yet the seroconversion rate among patients who used PEP decreased from 1.7% pre-PEP2PrEP to 0% post-PEP2PrEP. Regarding follow-up, most discontinuations occurred between the PrEP intake and 1-month follow-up visit.","74":"The rollout of antiviral therapy in Low and Middle Income Countries (LMICs) has reduced HIV transmission rates at the potential risk of resistant HIV transmission. We sought to predict the risk of wild type and antiviral resistance transmissions in these settings. A predictive model utilizing viral load, ART adherence, genital ulcer disease, condom use, and sexual event histories was developed to predict risks of HIV transmission to wives of 233 HIV+ men in 4 antiretroviral treatment centers in Maharashtra, India. ARV Therapy predicted a 5.71-fold reduction in transmissions compared to a model of using condoms alone, with 79.9%, of remaining transmissions resulting in primary ART-resistance. ART programs reduce transmission of HIV to susceptible partners at a substantial increased risk for transmission of resistant virus. Enhanced vigilance in monitoring adherence, use of barrier protections, and viral load may reduce risks of resistant HIV transmissions in LMIC settings.

The purpose of this analysis was to determine the combinations of factors that were most predictive of HIV infection and HIV testing among black men in Toronto. Classification and regression tree analysis was applied to secondary data collected from black men (N = 460) in Toronto, 82% of whom only had sex with women and 18% whom had sex with men at least once. For HIV infection, 10 subgroups were identified and characterized by number of lifetime male partners, age, syphilis history, and perceived stigma. Number of lifetime male partners was the best single predictor of HIV infection. For HIV testing, the analysis identified 8 subgroups characterized by age, condom use, number of sex partners and Chlamydia history. Age (&gt;24 years old) was the best single predictor of HIV testing.","78":"Growing evidence suggests that rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy for HIV improves care continuum outcomes. We evaluated process and clinical outcomes for rapid initiation in acute HIV infection within a multisite health care-based HIV testing and linkage to care program in Chicago. Through retrospective analysis of HIV testing data (2016-2017), we assessed linkage to care, initiation of antiretroviral therapy, and viral suppression. Of 334 new HIV diagnoses, 33 (9.9%) individuals had acute HIV infection. Median time to linkage was 11 (interquartile range [IQR]: 5-19.5) days, with 15 days (IQR 5-27) to initiation of antiretroviral therapy. Clients achieved viral suppression at a median of 131 (IQR: 54-188) days. Of all, 69.7% were retained in care, all of whom were virally suppressed. Sites required few additional resources to incorporate rapid initiation into existing processes. Integration of rapid initiation of antiretroviral therapy into existing HIV screening programs is a promising strategy for scaling up this important intervention.","79":null,"80":"Responding to the increasing reports of health students and professionals demonstrating stigmatized attitudes toward people living with HIV (PLHIV), this article examined the learning process that takes place during their academic training. Using symbolic interactionism as a theoretical framework, we studied the way lecturers in dietetic schools in Indonesia make meaning of their understanding and experience of HIV in relation to their teaching conduct. We found that the current curriculum does not provide adequate opportunities for students to learn and interact with PLHIV. Participants described HIV discussion is mainly limited to the clinical aspects and essential treatment as they were uncomfortable discussing HIV with the students. The ostensible symbolic meaning of HIV among dietetic lecturers in Indonesia was compounded with limitations and restrictions affecting their teaching practices and attitudes to PLHIV. Future intervention is required to help lecturers recognize their degree of awareness and personal values about HIV.","81":"To determine the prevalence and sociodemographic predictors of HIV among pregnant women in Botswana. This was a cross-sectional study of randomly enrolled women aged 18 to 49 years, attending 7 health facilities in Botswana. Data were gathered from November 2017 to March 2018 and analyzed using SPSS version 24. Of the 429 women enrolled, 407 (96.4%) were included in the analysis. The HIV prevalence was 17%; 69 of 407 (95% CI: 13.4- 21.0). Women aged 35 to 49 years had higher HIV prevalence than those 18 to 24 years (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 6.2; 95% CI: 2.7-14.4). Illiterate and elementary school educated women had higher HIV prevalence than those with a tertiary education (AOR = 8.5; 95% CI: 1.8-39.1). Those with a history of alcohol intake had a higher HIV prevalence than those without (AOR = 2.6; 95% CI: 1.3-5.3). HIV prevalence was lower than it was in 2011. Age, level of education, and history of alcohol intake were strong predictors for HIV infection calling for targeted behavioral change interventions. ","82":"Men generally fare worse than women across the HIV cascade. While we know much about how men perceive the health services, we know little about how health workers (HWs) themselves have experienced engaging with men and what strategies they have used to improve this engagement. We interviewed 12 HWs in public health care services in Cape Town to better understand their experiences and perspectives. Health workers felt there were significant gaps in men's engagement with HIV care and identified masculine gender norms, the persistent impact of HIV stigma, and the competing priorities of employment as key barriers. They also highlighted a number of health service-related challenges, including a poor perception of the patient-provider relationship, frustration at low service quality, and unrealistic expectations of the health services. Health workers also described several strategies for more effectively engaging men and for making the health services both more male friendly and more people friendly.","83":"Routine HIV screening rates are suboptimal. This systematic review identified barriers to\/facilitators of routine HIV testing, categorized them using the socioecological model (SEM), and provided recommendations for interventions to increase screening. Included articles were indexed in PubMed, EBSCO CINAHL, Scopus, Web of Science, and the Cochrane Library between 2006 and October 2018. Included studies were published in English or Spanish and directly assessed providers' barriers\/facilitators to routine screening. We used a standardized Excel template to extract barriers\/facilitators and identify levels in the SEM. Intrapersonal factors predominated as barriers, while facilitators were directed at the institutional level. Policy barriers are not universal across countries. Meta-analysis was not possible. We could not quantify frequency of any given barrier\/facilitator. Increasing reimbursement and adding screening as a quality measure may incentivize HIV testing; however, many interventions would require little resource investment. ","84":"Lack of health care worker (HCW) training is a barrier to implementing youth-friendly services. We examined training coverage and self-reported competence, defined as knowledge, abilities, and attitudes, of HCWs caring for adolescents living with HIV (ALWH) in Kenya. Surveys were conducted with 24 managers and 142 HCWs. Competence measures were guided by expert input and Kalamazoo II Consensus items. Health care workers had a median of 3 (interquartile range [IQR]: 1-6) years of experience working with ALWH, and 40.1% reported exposure to any ALWH training. Median overall competence was 78.1% (IQR: 68.8-84.4). In multivariable linear regression analyses, more years caring for ALWH and any prior training in adolescent HIV care were associated with significantly higher self-rated competence. Training coverage for adolescent HIV care remains suboptimal. Targeting HCWs with less work experience and training exposure may be a useful and efficient approach to improve quality of youth-friendly HIV services.","85":null,"86":"In India, there is little evidence on reasons for high rates of loss to HIV care. We conducted a clinic-based qualitative study at the YR Gaitonde Centre for AIDS Research and Education to explore factors that influence loss to care. In all, 17 men and 14 women were interviewed; median age was 42 (interquartile range [IQR], 36-48) and median CD4 count was 448 (IQR, 163-609). A majority reported avoiding treatment freely available at nearby government facilities because of disclosure concerns and perceptions of poor quality. As a result, participants sought care in the private sector where they were subjected to medication and transport costs. Life circumstances causing lost wages or unexpected expenditures therefore prevented participants from attending clinic, resulting in loss to care. Improving perceptions of quality of care in the public sector, addressing disclosure concerns, and reducing economic hardships among people living with HIV may be important in reducing loss to HIV care in India.","87":null,"88":"Estimating the population with undiagnosed HIV (PUHIV) is the most methodologically challenging aspect of evaluating 90-90-90 goals. The objective of this review is to discuss assumptions, strengths, and shortcomings of currently available methods of this estimation. Articles from 2000 to 2018 on methods to estimate PUHIV were reviewed. Back-calculation methods including CD4 depletion and test-retest use diagnosis CD4 count, or previous testing history to determine likely infection time thus, providing an estimate of PUHIV for previous years. Biomarker methods use immunoassays to differentiate recent from older infections. Statistical techniques treat HIV status as missing data and impute data for models of infection. Lastly, population surveys using HIV rapid testing most accurately calculates the current HIV prevalence. Although multiple methods exist to estimate the number of PUHIV, the appropriate method for future applications depends on multiple factors, namely data availability and population of interest.","89":"Nearly half of Kenyan men with HIV-positive partners do not know their partner's status. We carried out a qualitative substudy to explore the experiences of a sample of HIV-positive women when distributing HIV self-tests (HIVST) to their sexual partners. HIV-positive women were invited for in-depth interviews to share their experiences in offering HIVST to their partners and how self-testing impacted their relationships. Two hundred ninety-seven women were randomized to HIVST, 12 of whom self-reported being HIV positive and 11 participated in the interview. Self-testing procedures and interpretation of results were well understood. Participants were strategic in approaching their partners, thus avoided partner violence. Couple testing was high, which strengthened relationships, improved condom use, and empowered women to make joint decisions concerning their health. Giving HIV-positive women HIVST kits to distribute to their male partners is feasible and safe. Providers who have challenges reaching male partners with testing should consider HIVST. ","90":"More than half of newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients enter to care with a low CD4 count. A retrospective cohort study was conducted among newly diagnosed HIV-infected adults who were hospitalized. Of 148 patients, median (interquartile range [IQR]) age was 39.3 (30.5-47.1) years and 114 (77%) patients were male. Baseline median (IQR) CD4 count was 79 (24-218) cells\/mm3. The median (IQR) length of hospital stay was 8 (4-16) days. Half of the patients were hospitalized with AIDS-defining illness (ADI). Common opportunistic infections were Pneumocystis jirovecii pneumonia (20.3%) and tuberculosis (18.9%). CD4 count was statistically significantly associated with hospitalization with ADI (odds ratio: 0.85, per 10 cells\/mm3 increased; 95% confidence interval: 0.80-0.90). The mortality was 5.4%. In conclusion, half of newly diagnosed Thai HIV-infected patients were hospitalized with ADI. Early detection of HIV infection leading to early antiretroviral therapy initiation and prevention of serious complications is essential.","91":"In the United States, uptake of daily oral pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) to prevent HIV continues to grow albeit at a slower than desired pace. Innovations in PrEP delivery systems may partially address structural challenges related to PrEP uptake and PrEP persistence, such as difficulty in attending clinic visits or completing laboratory testing. To study PrEP services offered by a telehealth company called Nurx, we conducted 31 in-depth interviews with prospective or current patients. We hypothesized that patients would find the quarterly laboratory monitoring requirements to be onerous especially in light of receiving all other aspects of PrEP care through a telehealth delivery system. However, interviewees characterized navigating laboratory systems as relatively easy and complying with the quarterly monitoring as a supplementary benefit of PrEP use. Our research illustrates that quarterly monitoring requirements are meaningful to some telehealth PrEP users and may facilitate persistent engagement in receipt of PrEP care.","92":"Among HIV-uninfected, social media-using black, Hispanic, and white young men who have sex with men (YMSM) who had condomless anal sex but had not been HIV tested within the past year, we aimed to determine the extent of discordance between perception of having an undiagnosed HIV infection and HIV risk-taking behaviors. Despite reporting condomless anal sex without HIV testing, 64% of 358 YMSM participants perceived having an undiagnosed HIV infection as \"unlikely\" and 12% as \"impossible.\" Having a primary care provider and being Hispanic were associated with greater discordance. Interventions to decrease the discordance between perceived and actual HIV risk are needed for this higher HIV risk population.","93":"Prior work found &lt;4% of key populations living with HIV (KPLWH) in Tijuana, Mexico, were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). The goal of this pilot study was to examine community stakeholders' perceived need and acceptability of a peer-navigator program to improve ART coverage. We held a community forum and measured perspectives of key stakeholders in local organizations that serve KPLWH using online surveys, and in-depth interviews (with select key informants). Univariate descriptive statistics and emergent thematic analysis illustrated that there was general consensus that the program could improve ART coverage for KPLWH by helping to overcome geographic, transportation, and sociostructural barriers to HIV care. Police harassment, mobility, and non-HIV comorbidities were identified as challenges the program would need to navigate. Community stakeholders expressed perceived need and acceptability of a program to improve HIV care outcomes among KPLWH in Tijuana. The program should address the challenges identified by community stakeholders. ","94":"HIV is a serious chronic medical condition. Significant improvements in antiretroviral therapy have led to a transformation in its management. No curative treatment is available for HIV, and lifelong therapy is required with a combination of agents to control viral replication and prevent complications. Some of the older agents are notorious for many side effects, making patient compliance difficult, which is critical to preventing HIV resistance. Tenofovir is one of the newer, more tolerable, nucleotide reverse transcriptase inhibitors on the market; is a mainstay of many antiretroviral therapy combinations; and is now available in 2 different formulations, tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) and, the more recent, tenofovir alafenamide (TAF). These 2 formulations have very different pharmacokinetics, which seem to affect their efficacy and safety. This manuscript provides insight into the history of TDF and TAF development, their unique pharmacokinetics and pharmacology, clinically important adverse effects, monitoring, interactions, resistance, review of clinical studies, and guideline recommendations and clinical applications for tenofovir's various indications.","95":null,"96":"Transitioning from pediatric to adult care is a complicated process for youth with chronic illnesses. This study elucidates the unique factors affecting transition preparedness and perception of adult HIV care among a cohort of young women with HIV. Between 2013 and 2015, 48 women with HIV, who had experience with pediatric HIV care, were enrolled in a large Canadian cohort study. Variables were self-reported during peer-administered surveys. Only 60% reported feeling prepared for transition. Having never had contact with child protection services (P = .049), never been in foster care (P = .011), never been in a group home (P = .036), reporting a higher current CD4 count (P = .033), and reporting a younger ideal age for transition (P = .041) were associated with transition preparedness. Eighty-four percent reported equivalent or better HIV care following transition. Correlates of equivalent\/better care following transition included lower personal income (P = .023), higher CD4 count (P = .021), care by an adult infectious diseases specialist (P = .002), and transition preparedness (P = .005). Our findings highlight the importance of adequate transition preparation and its effect on perception of care following transition.","97":null,"98":"We determine the level of adherence to the revised Kenya early infant diagnosis (EID) algorithm during implementation of a point-of-care (POC) EID project. Data before (August 2016 to July 2017) and after (August 2017 to July 2018) introduction of POC EID were collected retrospectively from the national EID database and registers for 33 health facilities. We assessed the number of HIV-infected infants who underwent confirmatory testing and received baseline viral load test and proportion of infants with an initial negative result who had a subsequent test. Significantly higher number of infants accessed confirmatory testing (94.2% versus 38.6%; P &lt; .0001) with POC EID. Baseline viral load test and follow-up testing at 6 months, although higher with POC EID, were not significantly different from the pre-POC EID intervention period. The POC EID implementation has the potential to increase proportion of infants who receive confirmatory testing, thus reducing the risk of false-positive results. ","99":"The universal access to treatment and care for people living with HIV (PLWHIV) is still a major problem, especially in sub-Saharan Africa, where 70% of HIV-infected people live. Equally important is the fact that HIV\/AIDS-related stigma is recognized to be a major obstacle to successfully control the spread of this disease. We devised a pilot project (titled \"My friend with HIV remains a friend\") to fight the HIV\/AIDS stigmatization through educating secondary school students by openly HIV-positive teachers. In a first step, we have measured the amount and type of stigma felt by the PLWHIV in Buea\/Cameroon using the \"The people living with HIV Stigma Index\" from Joint United Nations Programme on HIV\/AIDS. Gossiping and verbal insults were experienced by 90% of the interviewees, while 9% have experienced physical assaults. Using these data and material from the \"Toolkit for action\" from the \"International Centre for the Research on Women,\" the teachers educated the students on multiple aspects of HIV\/AIDS and stigma. The teaching curriculum included role-plays, picture visualizations, drawing, and other forms of interactions like visits to HIV and AIDS treatment units. Before and after this intervention, the students undertook \"True\/False\" examinations on HIV\/AIDS and stigma. We compared these results with results from students from another school, who did not participate in this intervention. We were able to show that the students taking part in the intervention improved by almost 20% points in comparison to the other students. Their results did not change.","100":null,"101":"Persons living with HIV (PLWHs) are at high risk for medication errors when hospitalized, but antiretroviral medications are not often evaluated by antimicrobial stewardship programs (ASPs) because they are not specifically discussed in the standards of practice. However, antiretroviral (ARV) stewardship programs (ARVSPs) have been shown to decrease medication error rates and improve other outcomes. The goal of this article is to review published literature on ARVSPs and provide guidance on key aspects of ARVSPs. A MEDLINE search using the term \"antiretroviral stewardship\" was conducted. Original research articles evaluating ARVSPs in hospitalized, adult PLWHs were included. Six original research articles evaluating unique inpatient ARVSPs met inclusion criteria. All 6 studies evaluating medication errors as the primary outcome found a significant reduction in errors in the postimplementation phase. Based on current standards for ASPs, we propose core elements for ARVSPs. Future organizational guidelines for antimicrobial stewardship should include official recommendations for ARV medications.","102":"A 1-year quasi-experimental study was conducted among HIV-noninfected heterosexual partners of HIV-infected patients cared at a Thai tertiary care hospital. The educational interventions comprised a 1-hour educational session, a condom use teaching session, focus group discussion, and free HIV testing. Of the 88 seronegative partners enrolled, 53 and 35 underwent the educational interventions once and twice, respectively. After the educational interventions, the median score for knowledge on HIV infection and transmission prevention significantly increased (28 versus 21; P &lt; .001). After the interventions, higher proportions of the participants would use treatment of the HIV-infected partners (77% versus 58%) and preexposure prophylaxis (59% versus 38%) as methods to prevent HIV transmission and have a regular HIV blood test every 6 months (94% versus 81%). Among the 35 participants who participated in the educational interventions twice, most of the knowledge and positive attitudes were retained. The rates of regular HIV testing every 6 months had increased significantly from baseline to 1 year later (29% to 74%, respectively). None of the participants developed HIV infection. These findings suggest that the study interventions could improve knowledge about HIV infection and transmission prevention, attitude and practices toward prevention, and increase regular HIV testing among the seronegative partners.","103":"People living with HIV are at high risk for anal cancer (AC); however, the impact of screening for and treatment of precancerous anal lesions on AC incidence remains uncertain. In 2013, we conducted a survey of HIV providers evaluating the perceived need for an institutional AC screening program. Based on an overwhelmingly positive response, we established a dedicated AC screening clinic (including provision of high-resolution anoscopies) embedded within the institutional HIV clinic. Here, we describe that referral of high-risk patients in the first 3 years was lower than expected. Referral patterns suggest that screening practices vary widely among HIV providers within the institution. Anal cancer clinic patients who completed a perception survey rated the value of AC screening as high, with perceived positive health impact, and identified their providers as the main source of information on AC and AC screening. Our findings imply remaining provider-related barriers to AC screening.","104":null,"105":"Despite pre-exposure prophylaxis's (PrEP) efficacy for HIV prevention, uptake has been low among women with substance use disorders (SUDs) and attributed to women's lack of awareness. In semistructured interviews with 20 women with SUD and 15 key stakeholders at drug treatment centers, we assessed PrEP awareness and health-related decision-making. Women often misestimated their own HIV risk and were not aware of PrEP as a personally relevant option. Although women possessed key decision-making skills, behavior was ultimately shaped by their level of motivation to engage in HIV prevention. Motivation was challenged by competing priorities, minimization of perceived risk, and anticipated stigma. Providers were familiar but lacked experience with PrEP and were concerned about women's abilities to action plan in early recovery. HIV prevention for women with SUD should focus on immediately intervenable targets such as making PrEP meaningful to women and pursuing long-term systemic changes in policy and culture. Efforts can be facilitated by partnering with drug treatment centers to reach women and implement PrEP interventions.","106":"We determined the level, type of stigma, and risk factors associated with stigmatization of people living with HIV\/AIDS (PLWHA) by conducting a cross-sectional study from April to June 2018 in 3 HIV treatment centers in the Kumba Health District (KHD), Cameroon. We reviewed hospital registers, conducted focus group discussions, and administered structured questionnaires. For data analysis, we used the Statistical Package for Social Sciences version 20.0. We recorded a total stigma index score of 59.1. Internal stigma (odds ratio [OR] 2.91; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.74-4.98) was common in PLWHA. Also, younger age &lt;30 years (adjusted OR [AOR]: 0.39; 95% CI: 0.17-0.94) was linked with stigma reduction while low level of education (AOR: 1.74; 95% CI: 1.02-2.97) increased the stigma level. HIV-related stigma is pervasive in the lives of PLWHA, with most of them having internal stigmatization. Appropriate health education on HIV will be crucial in reducing stigmatization in the KHD.","107":"Evidence suggests that psychosocial stress negatively impacts immunological health in HIV-positive individuals. However, few studies have explored this association in substance-using older adults living with HIV (OALWH). We evaluated the effect of depression, loneliness, substance use problems, and HIV stigma on primary markers of immune function in a sample of 120 OALWH with substance-related issues. HIV stigma correlated with the greatest number of factors, including depression, loneliness, and substance use problems. Older age and antiretroviral adherence were associated with viral suppression, which was in turn associated with higher percentage of CD4 count. Multivariate path analyses demonstrated that lower HIV stigma and viral suppression were the only factors independently associated with higher percentage of CD4 count, with a significant indirect effect of adherence on CD4 through viral suppression. HIV stigma emerged as the most salient factor associated with both psychosocial well-being and immune health in the current study, suggesting that it is a critical factor to consider in future interventions for the rapidly growing population of OALWH.","108":null,"109":null,"110":"A chart review study of the sexually transmitted infection (STI) prevalence among persons living with HIV (PLHIV) was conducted among STI clinic attendees in Trinidad between January 2012 and December 2012. Data were abstracted from client records to obtain the clinical and the laboratory diagnoses of STIs. Descriptive and bivariate analyses were conducted, and factors significantly associated with the presence of a STI were assessed using multiple logistic regression. During this period, 385 PLHIV were seen; 104 (27.0%) were newly HIV diagnosed and 281 (73.0%) had a known history of HIV infection; 135 (35.1%) were diagnosed with a STI. Patients with known HIV infection were more likely to be diagnosed with a STI than those who were newly diagnosed (odds ratios: 6.99; 95% confidence interval: 3.79-12.89). The STI prevalence was high among PLHIV in Trinidad, identifying them as a critical target group for public health interventions to prevent the spread of HIV and STIs.","111":null,"112":"We qualitatively evaluated a novel educational program to help people living with HIV understand the role of rehabilitation, facilitate access to rehabilitation, and promote self-management of chronic disease in Canada. The program incorporated components of self-efficacy, client-centered care, peer education, and problem-based learning. Delivery of the community-engaged program was viewed as feasible and acceptable; however, a flexible delivery model was deemed important. Perceived learning was related to rehabilitation, advocacy, and taking responsibility for one's health. A co-leader model and access to online resources were strengths. Future work should assess the ability to apply advocacy knowledge and skills to access rehabilitation services.","113":"This study evaluated the reasons for not taking antiretroviral treatment (ART) among women of reproductive age who are disengaged from HIV care (have missed pharmacy pickups and physician visits), with the goal of identifying strategies for reengagement in HIV care. Participants were cisgender women (n = 162), 18 to 49 years of age, and who completed sociodemographic, medical history, reasons why they were not taking ART, mental health, motivation, and self-efficacy assessments. Latent class analysis was used for analysis. Women who reported avoidance-based coping (avoid thinking about HIV) had higher depression (U = 608.5, z = -2.7, P = .007), lower motivation (U = 601, z = -2.8, P = .006), and lower self-efficacy (U = 644.5, z = -2.4, P = .017) than those not using this maladaptive strategy. As women living with HIV experience a disproportionate burden of poor health outcomes, interventions focused on the management of depression may improve HIV outcomes and prevent HIV transmission.","114":"The HIV-infected older people in sub-Saharan Africa are inevitably vulnerable to chronic health-related conditions, yet the needed social support for these people is mostly inadequate. Drawing on the anthropology of disease and health paradigms, this study explores the recomposition of multidimensional and multidirectional nature of mutual familial support for older people living with or affected by HIV\/AIDS in Burkina Faso. We conducted multiple in-depth interviews among 147 individuals recruited from nonprofit organizations in Ouagadougou, Bobo-Dioulasso, Ouahigouya, and Yako through 2 projects funded by the National Agency for AIDS Research. Thematic and narrative analytical frameworks were used to analyze the data. We found that older people suffered serious socioeconomic and psychological challenges associated with HIV\/AIDS. Older people were particularly vulnerable to the double burden of HIV\/AIDS and caregiving responsibility for family members infected with the disease. However, the infected older people who received adequate treatment and familial support regained sociocultural positions as agents for cultural transition and material\/emotional resources. Although HIV\/AIDS potentially renegotiated the nature, intensity, and direction of familial support for vulnerable older people, the extrafamily solidarity seems an integral part of the great cycle of reciprocity and intrafamily mutual support. Health and policy interventions targeted at strengthening the interpersonal relationships and support for HIV\/AIDS-infected and HIV\/AIDS-affected older people are needed to improve their independence and well-being. ","115":"Jacksonville, Florida, provides services to persons living with the HIV. A federal call for integrated HIV prevention and treatment was published on June 19, 2015. This study unveils the principles that guided the local response to that call. Service providers have not systematically engaged in strategic planning for system improvement, the absence of which defines the boundaries and properties of the service system. Integration requires a unifying strategy as it draws leaders from their respective silos. Directed leadership, community-based participatory research, and action research provided a science-based framework for integration. Quantitatively, one-third of the planning implementation journey has elapsed, and 46% of the 75 planned activities have either reached fulfillment or are ongoing. Another one-fourth is in progress and slightly more than one-fourth (28%) are pending. Qualitatively, this study recorded 7 system-level changes. Progress to date is a harbinger of future system-level changes.","116":null,"117":"Partner services provide a safe and humane way for people living with HIV (PLWH) to alert their sex and\/or drug-injecting partners to the possibility of HIV exposure and the need for HIV testing, yet little is known about the ethical challenges of delivering partner services in prisons. In this article, we consider 7 key ethical and methodological questions that should be considered when developing, testing, or implementing partner services in prison settings. These questions relate to the ethics of: (1) mandatory HIV testing, (2) health illiteracy, (3) level of prison staff involvement, (4) protecting confidentiality, (5) minimizing harm, (6) achieving equivalency with community standards of care, and (7) providing HIV prevention and treatment services to index patient and their partners. By assisting PLWH in prison to inform partners with whom they may have shared HIV exposure either before or during incarceration, partner services can help to identify cases of undiagnosed HIV infection for testing and linkage to medical care. The acceptability and effectiveness of a future partner services model for PLWH in prison depends critically on answering these 7 questions to assure the highest ethical standards of research and practice.","118":"Using Anderson's Health Behavioral Model of Health Service Use, this study explores factors facilitating health service use among aging gay men living with HIV. Qualitative data from 10 participants recruited from a federally qualified health center were analyzed using theoretical thematic analysis. Results shown to facilitate health service use include an existing need for services in the form of HIV management; predisposing factors of age and the development of resilience in the face of stigmatizing experiences related to their sexual identity and health status; and enabling influences including comfort with medical providers, providers knowledgeable in lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, and queer issues, and sexual concordant providers. Need for services, predisposing factors, and enabling factors are discussed in relation, as well as each factor's unique implications for this population. Results from this study may be used to improve service use and provides tangible clinical recommendations.","119":"There are few validated tools to measure stigma, particularly among children living with HIV and their families. This study was nested within a larger study that followed 240 child-caregiver dyads (children aged 10-15 years) at 8 clinics in western Kenya. The stigma instrument was administered to all child-caregiver dyads at 2 time points 6 months apart. The primary end point was to construct validity assessed by comparison to criterion constructs using generalized estimating equation models. Mean age of child participants was 12.3 years and 52% were female. Generally, caregivers reported experiencing higher levels of HIV stigma compared to their children. Children (9%) and caregivers (14%) reported that HIV stigma made them feel stressed, anxious, and depressed. Child and caregiver stigma items showed high construct validity by emotional and behavioral outcomes. The stigma instrument showed high validity when compared to emotional and behavioral outcomes. ","120":"We examined how multiple, nested, and interacting systems impact the protective process of resilience for women living with HIV (WLWH). Using data from a Cohort Study, we conducted univariate analyses, multivariable logistic regression, and a 2-step structural equation modeling for the outcome, high resilience (N = 1422). Participants reported high overall resilience scores with a mean of 62.2 (standard deviation = 8.1) and median of 64 (interquartile range = 59-69). The odds of having high resilience were greater for those residing in Quebec compared to Ontario (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] = 2.1 [1.6, 2.9]) and British Columbia (aOR = 1.8 [1.3, 2.5]). Transgender women had increased odds of high resilience than cisgender women (aOR = 1.9 [1.0, 3.6]). There were higher odds of resilience for those without mental health diagnoses (aOR = 2.4 [1.9, 3.0]), non-binge drinkers (aOR=1.5 [1.1, 2.1]), and not currently versus previously injecting drugs (aOR = 3.6 [2.1, 5.9]). Structural equation modeling confirmed that factors influencing resilience lie at multiple levels: micro, meso, exo, and macro systems of influence. There is a need to consider resilience as the interaction between the person and their environments, informing the development of multilevel interventions to support resilience among WLWH. ","121":"We compared quality improvement (QI) interventions for prevention of mother-to-child transmission in a private hospital and a government hospital (GH). From November 2013 to October 2016, data were extracted retrospectively for HIV-positive mothers and HIV-exposed infants. The overall number of mother-baby pairs (MBPs) was significantly (P &lt; .001) higher at the GH (mean = 294, standard deviation [SD] = 180) than the private hospital (mean = 72, SD = 27). There was a significantly higher number of MBPs receiving care (P &lt; .001) and routine services (P &lt; .001) at the GH. The proportion of MBPs retained in care (P &lt; .001) and receiving the routine service package (P &lt; .001) was significantly higher at the private hospital. Overtime, indicators at the private hospital peaked significantly in year 2 and reduced moderately in the final year. The trend for the GH showed gradual but nonsignificant improvement in 2 indicators. QI showed positive results in the private hospital. If systematically applied in GHs, QI can support improved services for larger patient volumes.","122":"Simplifying or switching antiretroviral therapy (ART) in treatment-experienced people living with HIV (PLWH) may improve adherence, tolerability, toxicities, and\/or drug-drug interactions. The purpose of this review is to critically evaluate the literature for efficacy and safety associated with switching or simplifying ART in treatment-experienced PLWH. A systematic literature search using MEDLINE was performed from January 1, 2010 to April 30, 2018. References within articles of interest, the Department of Health and Human Services guidelines, and conference abstracts were also reviewed. Switch\/simplification strategies were categorized as those supported by high-level clinical evidence and those with emerging data. Rates of virologic suppression were noninferior for several switch\/simplification strategies when compared to baseline ART. Potential for reducing adverse events was also seen. Additional evidence for some strategies, including most 2-drug regimens, is needed before they can be recommended.","123":"Comorbidities are increasingly common among people living with HIV (PLWH) as they age. There is no evidence regarding models of care. We aimed to assess feasibility of a novel methodology to investigate care processes for serious medical events in PLWH. The method was based on the National Confidential Enquiry into Patient Outcome and Death (NCEPOD). Data were extracted from medical records and questionnaires completed by general practitioners (GPs), HIV physicians, and non-HIV specialist physicians. A panel reviewed anonymized cases and gave feedback on the review process. Eleven of 13 patients consented to the study. Questionnaires were completed by 64% of HIV physicians, 67% of non-HIV specialist physicians, and 55% of GPs. The independent review panel (IRP) advised improvement in the methodology including data presentation and timing. This method was acceptable to patients and secondary care physicians. Further work is needed to the improve GP responses and facilitate IRP. ","124":"Utilization of the prevention of mother-to-child transmission of HIV (PMTCT) services remains a challenge as losses to follow-up are substantial. This study explored factors that influence adherence to maternal antiretroviral (ARV) medications among PMTCT mothers in Malawi. We conducted a descriptive qualitative study from September 2016 to May 2017 using purposive sampling among 16 PMTCT mothers and 4 key informant interviews with health-care workers. Data were audio-recorded and analyzed thematically. The factors that influence adherence to maternal ARV medications include the quality of PMTCT services and social support. Factors that impede adherence include suboptimal counseling women receive on ARV medications, cost of travel, and conflicting advice from religious institutions. Adherence to maternal ARV medications will require the use of existing social support systems in a woman's life as a platform for delivery of the drugs while also maintaining continued and comprehensive counseling on the benefits of maternal ARV medications.","125":"Attendance to clinic appointments and compliance with treatment plans are essential components of HIV\/AIDS care. Compliance is especially important in young and minority individuals living with HIV\/AIDS. We assessed the effectiveness of a text-based reminder system compared with usual care in improving the attendance to clinic and social work appointments at a Ryan White-funded clinic based in an academic institution. Convenience sample looking at 2 periods, 6 months before initiation of text messages and 6 months after initiation of text messages. Following a 6-month postintervention period, we found a statistically significant reduction in our no-show rates (individuals failing to keep scheduled appointments) of 24.8% versus 17.7%, P value .05. Using an inexpensive online text messaging system, we were able to significantly decrease no-show rates in a primarily younger, low-income, and uninsured population. ","126":"Cerebral toxoplasmosis is the most common cause of expansive brain lesions in people living with HIV\/AIDS (PLWHA) and continues to cause high morbidity and mortality. The most frequent characteristics are focal subacute neurological deficits and ring-enhancing brain lesions in the basal ganglia, but the spectrum of clinical and neuroradiological manifestations is broad. Early initiation of antitoxoplasma therapy is an important feature of the diagnostic approach of expansive brain lesions in PLWHA. Pyrimethamine-based regimens and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) seem to present similar efficacy, but TMP-SMX shows potential practical advantages. The immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome is uncommon in cerebral toxoplasmosis, and we now have more effective, safe, and friendly combined antiretroviral therapy (cART) options. As a consequence of these 2 variables, the initiation of cART can be performed within 2 weeks after initiation of antitoxoplasma therapy. Herein, we will review historical and current concepts of epidemiology, diagnosis, and treatment of HIV-related cerebral toxoplasmosis.","127":"","128":null,"129":"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence is crucial to achieve HIV suppression and to prolong survival of HIV-infected patients. Although monitoring of ART adherence is standard of HIV care, there is yet no optimal method to measure ART adherence. Therefore, it is essential to compare the effectiveness of different adherence measurement tools to predict HIV suppression. In this study, we measured ART adherence using pharmacy refill prescription and self-reported adherence questionnaire. Both the methods were compared for predicting HIV suppression in adult Omani HIV-infected patients attending the outpatient clinics at Sultan Qaboos University Hospital. A total of 141 HIV-infected patients were included. The pharmacy refill-based measure showed a median adherence rate of 98.90% (interquartile range [IQR]: 86%-99.45%). The self-report adherence questionnaire revealed a median adherence rate of 100% (IQR: 75-100). A significant positive correlation was found between the adherence rates measured by the 2 methods (r = 0.32, P = .01). The pharmacy refill and self-report questionnaire adherence measures were both negatively correlated with plasma HIV RNA levels (r = -0.20, P = .01 and r = -0.26, P = .04, respectively). Collectively, these findings suggest that pharmacy refill measure could serve as a valid and practical tool of ART adherence in routine clinical practice. ","130":"We conducted a cross-sectional analysis of baseline data from the Adolescent Trials Network for HIV\/AIDS Interventions to examine the association between the use of social media sites to find sex partners and recent diagnosis of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) among 13- to 24-year-old men who have sex with men and transgender women living with HIV. We used linear regression to determine the relationship between the number of STIs and the number of social media sites used to find sex partners with each type of sex act included in the analysis. Secondary analyses substituted frequency of social media site use for number of social media sites. Among 741 participants, for every 1 social media account used to find sex partners, there was a 2.53% (95% confidence interval: 0.28-5.54) increase in STIs. This association was mediated through condomless receptive anal intercourse or condomless insertive anal intercourse but not barrierless oral intercourse. Similar but attenuated associations were found when frequency of social media site use was substituted for number of social media sites. Future research should examine innovative interventions on these social media sites with respect for its users.","131":null,"132":"This article aims to elucidate the relationship between antiretroviral (ARV) medication changes and all-cause mortality using a total of 368 patients recruited from the United States (78%), United Kingdom (11%), and Canada (11%). Data sources included demographic characteristics, ARV treatment history and modifications, and clinical biomarker data from the completed OPTions In Management with Antiretrovirals clinical trial. Descriptive analysis and graphical trajectory representation of ARV drug modifications and biomarker changes were undertaken. Three hypotheses aimed at assessing the impact of ARV modification parameters on clinical outcomes were tested. Kaplan-Meier survival techniques as well as Cox proportional hazard regression models were employed. Results from the analyses suggest that (1) switching therapy strategy from an intensified ARV regimen to a less intense one or vice versa, (2) having a moderate number (up to 2) of ARV drug changes per 6 months, and (3) changes based on clinical\/HIV-related reasons or nonclinical reasons compared to ARV drug regimen changes due to clinical non-HIV reasons improved survival. Modifications in the ARV regimens of HIV-infected patients with multidrug resistance are associated with improved survival. ","133":"Antiretroviral therapy (ART) is considered the treatment that enables people living with HIV (PLHIV) to lead a \"normal life\". In spite of the availability of free treatment, patients in resource-poor settings may continue to incur additional costs to realize a normal and full life. This article describes the monetary expenses and psychosocial distress people on free ART bear to live normally. We conducted in-depth interviews with 50 PLHIV on ART. We found that the demands of treatment, poverty, stigma, and health-system constraints interplay to necessitate that PLHIV bear continuous monetary and psychosocial costs to realize local values that define normal life. In the context, access to free medicines is not sufficient to enable PLHIV in resource-poor settings to normalize life. Policy makers and providers should consider proactively complementing free ART with mechanisms that empower PLHIV economically, enhance their problem-solving capacities, and provide an enabling environment if the objective of normalizing life is to be achieved.","134":"Reorganizing service delivery to integrate nutrition and infant and young child feeding (IYCF) with prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) is important for improving outcomes of HIV-positive mothers and HIV-exposed infants (HEIs). Quality improvement (QI) strategies were implemented at 22 health facilities. The percentage of HIV-positive pregnant women and lactating mothers who received IYCF counseling at each visit improved (45%-100%; mean = 93.1%, standard deviation [SD] = 15.5). Adherence to IYCF practices improved (70%-96%; mean = 92.4%, SD = 8.5). Mother-baby pairs receiving the standard care package improved (0%-100%; mean = 98.6%, SD = 22.6). The HEIs alive at 18 months and infected decreased (mean = 6.2%, SD = 4.8). Statistical significance of change was estimated using Fisher exact test and magnitude of change over time by calculating the odds ratio. For all indicators, improvement was rapid and significant (P &lt; .001), especially in the first 6 months of QI implementation. Using QI to integrate nutrition and ensure consistent and comprehensive PMTCT service delivery improved IYCF adherence and decreased transmission.","135":"Despite advances in coverage and quality of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs, infant protection from postnatal HIV infection remains an issue in high HIV-burdened countries. We designed a quality improvement (QI) intervention-the Partnership for HIV-Free Survival (PHFS)-to improve infant survival. PHFS convened leaders in 6 sub-Saharan African nations to discover together the best strategies for implementing and scaling up existing PMTCT protocols to ensure optimal health of mother-baby pairs and HIV-free infant survival. We used 3 core technical components-rapid adaptive design, collaborative learning, and scale-up\/sustainability designs-to test strategies for accelerating effective PMTCT programming in complex, resource-poor settings. Learning generated included the need for increased ownership and codesign of improvement initiatives with Ministries of Health, better integration of initiatives into existing programs, and the need to sustain QI capability throughout the system. PHFS can serve as a design prototype for future global networks aiming to accelerate improvement, learning, and results.","136":"A Community Health System Strengthening model, which mobilizes communities by applying quality improvement, was used in 39 communities around 3 health centers in Gaza Province, Mozambique, to increase identification of pregnant women and support them to attend antenatal care (ANC). This article describes the process and results. Community group representatives formed a community improvement team to spread messages about the importance of ANC, identify pregnant women, link them to the facility, and follow up. Between March 2014 and February 2015, teams identified 2020 pregnant women. Antenatal care attendance increased at all 3 centers. One health center did an additional chart review and found that postintervention, women were enrolling in care earlier in pregnancy. There were no changes in HIV testing or treatment initiation for HIV-positive women. Community-led improvement initiatives play an important role in connecting pregnant women with services to receive testing and treatment to promote optimal health and prevent HIV transmission.","137":"With the ultimate goal of developing an accident and emergency (A&amp;E) department HIV testing program in Belize City, Belize, we sought input from key stakeholders on program components and potential facilitators and barriers to HIV testing in emergency care. We conducted semistructured interviews among 4 key stakeholder groups at Karl Heusner Memorial Hospital Authority (KHMHA) in Belize City: (1) 20 A&amp;E patients, (2) 5 A&amp;E physicians, (3) 5 A&amp;E nurses, and (4) 5 KHMHA administrators. We performed a qualitative content analysis of the interview transcripts and isolated important themes. Major themes included: (1) Patient selection: patients preferred to test all A&amp;E patients. All other stakeholder groups preferred testing specific patient groups. (2) Training: Specific training should be completed for staff. (3) Confidentiality: integral for testing. (4) Facilitators and barriers: facilitators included respectful relationships, privacy, resources, coordination, and education. Barriers included stigmatization, patient willingness, inadequate resources, privacy, and testing biases.","138":null,"139":"To evaluate the association between human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) patients and medical costs (inpatient, outpatient, pharmacy, total) using a national cohort of HIV-infected Veterans and non-HIV matched controls within the Veteran's Affairs (VA) Administration system. This study used claims (January 2000 to December 2016) extracted from the VA Informatics and Computing Infrastructure and VA Health Economics Resource Center. Cases included Veterans with an International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision\/International Classification of Diseases, Tenth Revision for HIV with at least 1 prescription for a complete antiretroviral therapy regimen (January 2000 to September 2016). Two non-HIV controls were exact matched on race, sex, month, and year of birth. All patients were followed until the earliest of the following: last date of VA activity, death, or December 31, 2016. A total of 79 578 patients (26 526 HIV and 53 052 non-HIV) met all study criteria. The average age was 49.3 years, 38% were black, 32% were white, and 97% were male for both the HIV and control cohorts. Adjusted multivariable logistic regression models demonstrated that HIV was associated with higher odds of incurring a pharmacy cost (odds ratio = 2286.45, 95% confidence interval: 322.79-16 195.82), 4-fold, and 2-fold higher odds of incurring both outpatient and inpatient costs compared to the matched controls, respectively. In adjusted multivariable gamma generalized linear models, HIV-positive patients had an almost 4-fold, 17-fold, and almost 2-fold higher cost than matched controls in total, pharmacy, and outpatient costs, respectively. This study found an association between HIV-positive patients having higher odds of incurring a medical cost as well as higher medical costs compared to non-HIV controls. ","140":"Over half of mother-to-child HIV transmission (MTCT) occurs postdelivery. Keeping mother-infant pairs in care remains challenging. Health workers in 3 countries used quality improvement (QI) approaches to improve data systems, mother-infant retention, and facility-based care delivery. The number and proportion of infants with known HIV status at time of discharge from early infant diagnosis programs increased in Tanzania and Uganda. We analyzed data using statistical process control charts. Mother-to-child HIV transmission did not decrease in 15 Kenyan sites, decreased from 12.7% to 3.8% in 28 Tanzanian sites, and decreased from 17.2% to 1.5% in 10 Ugandan sites with baseline data. This improvement is likely due to the combination of option B+, service delivery improvements, and retention through QI approaches. Reaching the global MTCT elimination target and maximizing infant survival will require health systems to support mother-infant pairs to remain in care and support health workers to deliver care. Quality improvement approaches can support these changes.","141":null,"142":"The World Health Organization guidelines for treating pregnant HIV-positive women and preventing HIV transmission to infants now recommend lifelong antiretroviral treatment for pregnant and breastfeeding women. We applied quality improvement (QI) methods to support governments and facility staff to address service gaps in 5 countries under the Partnership for HIV-Free Survival (PHFS). We used 3 key strategies: break the complex problem of improving HIV-free survival into more easily implementable phases, support a national management team to oversee the project, and support facility-level staff to learn and apply QI methods to reducing mother-to-child transmission. The key results in each country were increases in data completeness and accuracy, increases in retention in care of mother-baby pairs (MBPs), increase in coverage of MBPs with appropriate services, and reduction in vertical transmission of HIV. The PHFS experience offers a model that other multicountry networks can adopt to improve service delivery and quality of care.","143":"As countries pursue UNAIDS's 90-90-90 target for ending the AIDS epidemic, success is dependent on learning how to deliver effective care. We describe a learning network and mechanisms used to foster communication and sharing of ideas and results across 6 countries in the Partnership for HIV-Free Survival. The network used 2 forms of peer exchange, in-person and virtual, and a variety of knowledge management mechanisms to harvest and spread key learning. Key learning included valuable insights on how to design and convene a multicountry learning network, including top enablers of success and practical insights on the network's value. The network was instrumental in accelerating learning about improving care. Our experience shows the value of creating a quality improvement-driven, multicountry learning network to accelerate the pace of improving care systems. Government ownership and adaptation of collaborative learning efforts to the country context must be considered when designing future networks.","144":"In Vietnam where alcohol use is culturally normative and little treatment is available, persons living with HIV (PLWH) who consume alcohol at unhealthy levels are at greatly increased risk for negative health outcomes. We describe the first systematic adaptation of 2 evidence-based alcohol interventions for use in Vietnam: a combined motivational enhancement therapy\/cognitive behavioral therapy and a brief alcohol intervention. Using the situated information, motivation and behavioral skills model, and systematic procedures for tailoring evidence-based treatments, we identified core intervention content to be preserved and key characteristics to be tailored for relevance to the clinical setting. We describe the use of in-depth interviews with antiretroviral treatment clients and providers, expert input, and counselor training procedures to develop tailored manuals for counselors and clients. Adapting evidence-based alcohol treatments for global settings is facilitated by the use of a model of behavior change and systematic procedures to operationalize the approach.","145":"Young men who have sex with men (YMSM) are disproportionately affected by HIV in the United States. High-risk sexual behaviors are difficult to modify; thus, HIV pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with a daily pill is a promising prevention tool for this vulnerable population. We present a case of a young black MSM who was able to successfully access PrEP with the help of a community program but was not able to adhere to the regimen or engage in care. He ultimately acquired HIV infection. We review the existing literature and advocate for increased services and research to support youth's adherence to PrEP and engagement in HIV prevention programs, with a focus on YMSM of color.","146":"Effective approaches to promoting pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) and linkage to PrEP care among those who may benefit the most from PrEP has proven to be a major challenge. We designed and pilot tested a strengths-based case management (SBCM) intervention for PrEP linkage. Adults interested in PrEP and meeting criteria (n = 61) were randomized to passive referral (control) or active SBCM (treatment). Outcomes measured were completion of provider visit, initiation of PrEP, and time to initiation of PrEP. Overall, 34% initiated PrEP by 12 weeks: 9 (29%) in the control group and 12 (40%) in the treatment group. The mean time to PrEP initiation was 13.1 weeks (95% confidence interval, 12.0-14.2) with no difference between groups ( P = .382). There was a 21% difference in achieving a provider visit between the treatment and control groups (53.3% versus 32.3%) by 12 weeks ( P = .096). Participants encountered financial, logistical, social, and provider-related barriers to PrEP access. Strengths-based case management-based patient navigation is a promising strategy for assisting PrEP seekers in obtaining a medical provider visit and initiating PrEP.","147":"To address the gap in knowledge about HIV risk reduction materials that target older adults. This review offered a comprehensive and rigorous examination of HIV risk reduction education materials that targeted older adults in the United States, assessing the gap in their coverage and content. A cross-sectional review of both print and Internet sources from state departments of public health, state and area agencies on aging, and web resources that targeted older populations was performed. Of 29 health departments and 13 state and area agencies on aging that responded to the request, there were 9 HIV education materials identified that targeted older people. Of those materials, only 2 addressed the majority of aging-specific recommendations made from a previous study that described important HIV risk reduction information. Recommendations are made about dissemination ideas to increase awareness and utilization of HIV educational materials. ","148":"Persons with HIV have elevated risk for cardiovascular disease, but little is known about the risk of ventricular ectopy and ventricular tachycardia (VE\/VT) for HIV-infected (HIV+) persons. We evaluated the presence and anatomic origin of VE\/VT for HIV+ persons and controls by screening a cohort using International Classification of Diseases codes and adjudicating positive screens by chart review. We sought to evaluate (1) presence of VE\/VT and (2) likely anatomic origin of the VE\/VT based on electrocardiogram. There was no significant difference in the prevalence of VE\/VT for HIV+ or uninfected persons. Among HIV+ persons, worse HIV control was associated with significantly greater odds of VE\/VT. Exploratory analyses suggested that HIV+ persons may have a greater likelihood of VE\/VT originating from the left ventricle. Although worse HIV control was associated with higher odds of VE\/VT among persons with HIV, odds of VE\/VT were not higher for persons with HIV than uninfected persons. ","149":"Miami has the highest rate of new HIV diagnoses in the United States. We examined the early successes and challenges in fulfilling recommendations made by the Miami-Dade County HIV\/AIDS Getting to Zero Task Force, formed by local experts in 2016. We used a host of surveillance data, published empirical studies, public reports, and unpublished data from partners of the Task Force to evaluate progress and challenges in meeting the recommendations. Improvements in prevention and care included routinized HIV testing in emergency departments, moving the linkage-to-care benchmark from 90 to 30 days, increased viral suppression, and awareness of pre-exposure prophylaxis. However, treatment enrollment, viral suppression, and pre-exposure prophylaxis uptake remained low. Recommendations from the Task Force provide excellent guidance for implementing evidence-based HIV prevention in Miami, yet success in achieving the recommendations will require continued or increased support in many public health sectors in South Florida. ","150":"The present study aimed to report the prevalent HIV-1 drug-resistant mutations in patients with HIV-1 alone and tuberculosis (TB) coinfection alone to improve our understanding of the mutation patterns and aid treatment decisions. Patients with HIV-1 and HIV-TB on treatment for more than 1 year with suspected failure were recruited. Sequencing of protease and two-thirds of the region of reverse transcriptase gene was done for drug-resistant mutations. In the HIV-TB group (n = 25), 88%, 92%, and 12% had mutations to nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NRTIs), non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors (NNRTIs), and protease inhibitors (PIs), respectively. In the HIV-alone group (n = 25), 84%, 100%, and 4% had mutations to NRTIs, NNRTIs, and PIs, respectively. M184V, M41L, D67N, G190A, A98G, and K103N were the most common mutations seen. There is a high prevalence of drug-resistant mutations in HIV and HIV-TB coinfected patients. ","151":"Reports on malaria and HIV coinfections in exposed infants from tropical countries are scarce. The case of a 2-month-old HIV-exposed Nigerian infant who presented with intermittent fever at a Nigerian tertiary hospital is reported. The rarity of the case and the challenges associated with making the diagnosis informed our decision to report the case. Diagnosing malaria in HIV-exposed infants in early infancy requires a high index of suspicion, good knowledge of the clinical presentation, and appropriate microbiological investigations for sepsis and malaria. Further studies need to be conducted on the association between malaria and HIV exposure. ","152":null,"153":"A successful antiretroviral therapy (ART) drug adherence is achieved when patients follow their prescribed regimen. This is determined by patient's motivation that is influenced by resources associated with the patient, society, and relevant institutions. The aim of this study is to assess the impact of formal and informal actors on patients' ART drug adherence. A qualitative study approach was conducted through face-to-face in-depth interviews of HIV-infected patients and key informants. The analysis was guided by a salutogenic model focusing on generalized resistance resources and a sense of coherence. The finding shows that 76% of the study participants achieved the recommended 95% adherence level. Several resources attributed to individuals, society, and public institutions influencing patients' day-to-day life and their drug adherence were identified. Patients who are able to use the available resources easily develop sense of coherence and follow their prescribed drug regimen. Therefore, encouraging HIV-infected patients through formal and informal actors can enhance ART drug adherence.","154":"An HIV diagnosis may be associated with severe emotional and psychological distress, which can contribute to delays in care or poor self-management. Few studies have explored the emotional, psychological, and psychosocial impacts of an HIV diagnosis on women in low-resource settings. We conducted in-depth interviews with 30 women living with HIV in the Dominican Republic. Interviews were audio-recorded, transcribed, and analyzed using the biographical disruption framework. Three disruption phases emerged (impacts of a diagnosis, postdiagnosis turning points, and integration). Nearly all respondents described the news as deeply distressful and feelings of depression and loss of self-worth were common. Several reported struggling with the decision to disclose-worrying about stigma. Postdiagnosis turning points consisted of a focus on survival and motherhood; social support (family members, friends, HIV community) promoted integration. The findings suggest a need for psychological resources and social support interventions to mitigate the negative impacts of an HIV diagnosis.","155":"Despite recommendations for rapidly initiating HIV treatment, many persons in sub-Saharan Africa present to care with advanced HIV disease. Baseline survey and clinical data were collected on 1799 adults newly enrolling at 32 district hospitals and local health HIV clinics in rural Ethiopia. Among those with complete HIV disease information, advanced HIV disease (defined as CD4 count &lt;200 cells\/mm3 or World Health Organization [WHO] HIV clinical stage III or IV disease) was present in 66% of males and 56% of females ( P &lt; .001). Males (compared to females) had lower CD4 counts (287 cells\/mm3 versus 345 cells\/mm3), lower body mass index (19.3 kg\/m2 versus 20.2 kg\/m2), and more WHO stage III or IV disease (46% versus 37%), ( P &lt; .001). Men reported more chronic diarrhea, fevers, cough, pain, fatigue, and weight loss ( P &lt; .05). Most initiating care in this resource-limited setting had advanced HIV disease. Men had poorer health status, supporting the importance of earlier diagnosis, linkage to care, and initiation of antiretroviral therapy.","156":"To meet the reproductive health needs of women, especially those in sub-Saharan Africa, multipurpose prevention technologies (MPTs) that combine pregnancy and HIV prevention into a single product could be highly beneficial. This qualitative study with health care providers in Kenya and South Africa examined health system factors that may facilitate or inhibit the delivery of these MPTs. Twelve qualitative interviews were conducted with health care providers at each site (24 interviews total). Providers were presented with pictures and actual placebo prototypes of 4 MPTs: a vaginal ring, an oral pill, an injectable, and an implant. Four themes emerged related to health care providers' reported interest in offering the proposed MPTs: (1) perceptions of young women's interest in the MPTs, (2) considerations about product administration, (3) feedback about product attributes, and (4) providers' training needs. Overwhelmingly, health care providers are eager to offer a product that prevents both HIV and unintended pregnancy in young women.","157":null,"158":"We describe the care burden derived from a lung cancer screening program in high-risk patients with HIV. In a well-selected group with the described criteria, one annual low-dose thoracic computed tomographic exploration can be applied to 7.2% of the patients attended (95% confidence interval: 4.2-9.6), with at least one follow-up exploration in another 1.3%, with the generation of at least 2 extra visits for explanation of the protocol and results. If smoking habit does not change over the next 2 years, another 4.3% of the patients will have met the inclusion criteria. Early detection of lung cancer with low-dose thoracic computed tomographic could be of interest in HIV-infected patients because of the increased of risk but would imply an increase in care burden that must be taken into account.","159":"After diagnosis, a substantial number of people with HIV disease fall out of care. Effective interventions are needed for this priority population. The \"Peers Keep It Real\" study aimed to help adults who were disengaged from HIV treatment. Peers, lay individuals living with HIV, facilitated intervention sessions. Participants were randomized to immediately receive the peer-facilitated intervention or were wait-listed. Considerable attrition occurred in the control group. Pre-\/postanalyses showed that among participants (n = 23) who received the intervention, 65% had viral load suppression and 100% remained in care at 12 months postintervention. Impact on viral load was significant ( P = .0326), suggesting that peers are effective change agents who positively impacted outcomes for individuals struggling with adherence to HIV treatment. Future endeavors should consider providing all individuals from this priority population with an active peer intervention from the onset to enhance retention and adherence. ","160":"Kenya is one of 22 countries globally that account for 90% of all HIV-positive pregnant women. This study aimed to determine factors affecting uptake of prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services among HIV-positive pregnant women at Lodwar County Referral Hospital in Turkana County, an arid area in northern Kenya. We conducted a retrospective review of HIV-positive pregnant women attending antenatal care (ANC) and accessing PMTCT services between January 2015 and December 2016. We used infant prophylaxis as a proxy measure of PMTCT uptake, and records across programs were linked using the mother's unique medical identification number. A total of 230 participants were included in the study. Bivariate analyses showed maternal prophylaxis (odds ratio [OR] = 45.71; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 10.35-202.00), residing in urban center (OR = 2.64, 95% CI: 1.45-4.81), and having at least one ANC visit (OR = 2.78; 95% CI: 1.25-6.17) were significantly associated with uptake of PMTCT.","161":"The high cost of direct-acting antiviral-based regimens raises concerns about the outcome of treatment in uninsured patients with chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. This study assessed the relationship between health insurance status and sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in a community hospital in South Florida. Sofosbuvir-based therapy was initiated in 82 patients, of which 73% were uninsured and 28 (34%) were HIV coinfection. The overall SVR rate for those tested was 98%. The SVR rates were similar between HCV mono- and HCV\/HIV coinfected patients (96% versus 100%, P = .204). Uninsured patients, with access to patient assistance programs, had comparable SVR rates to insured patients (100% versus 95%, P = .131). However, there was a trend toward a higher rate of loss to follow-up in uninsured compared to insured patients (25% versus 9%, P = .116). Strategies specific to adherence to treatment for uninsured patients are needed to reduce rates of loss to follow-up.","162":"There is a critical shortage of trained human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) providers in resource-limited settings. To strengthen preservice HIV training for postgraduate health care providers, University of Maryland's Institute of Human Virology and Center for Clinical Care and Research Nigeria collaborated with University of Nigeria to plan and implement a comprehensive 4-week course in HIV medicine. The first course was piloted with 30 postgraduate doctors. Mean objective structured clinical examinations (OSCE), pretest, and posttest scores score were 51%, 53%, and 75%, respectively; follow-up examination at 6 months showed mean score of 74%. In multivariate regression analysis, pretest score was positively associated with posttest score (22.03, P &lt; .001) and OSCE (0.29, P = .04), age negatively associated with pretest score (-0.94, P = .001), and female gender positively associated with OSCE score (6.15, P = .05). Six- and 18-month online surveys revealed trainees continued to apply knowledge and skills gained. North-south university collaborations to develop practicum-based preservice curricula offer a sustainable way to strengthen preservice evidence-based HIV medicine training with long-lasting retention of skills and knowledge.","163":"Holding support groups with the same cohort of adolescents during clinic visits promises to increase engagement in care. Participants (N = 35 patients, aged 12-18, 50% female, from an adolescent HIV clinic in Kumasi, Ghana, were divided into 5 teams. Clinic visits were coordinated for members of each team. Team members participated in group discussions and activities while waiting to meet with their medical team. Teams met quarterly for 1 year. Participants reported benefits from talking with peers about the challenges of managing HIV. Clinic attendance improved from the preceding year (54% versus 84%). There were reductions in perceived internal stigma, perceived external stigma, worries about unintended disclosure from taking antiretroviral therapy (ART), and reduced ART concerns. The program demonstrated the feasibility, safety, and acceptability of facilitating increased interaction among adolescents living with HIV during clinic visits. Improvements in clinic attendance, perceived stigma, and concern about medications suggest that the intervention is a promising candidate for additional study.","164":"In Taiwan, men who have sex with men (MSM) are at disproportionate risk of HIV infection. We examined awareness and acceptability of future HIV vaccines. From July to August 2014, we conducted a cross-sectional survey with MSM recruited through community-based organizations (CBOs) in 2 cities. Among 200 participants (mean age, 27.6 years), half reported multiple partners and one-third condomless anal sex (past 3 months); 12% were HIV-positive. Traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) use was reported by 42.7%. Over two-thirds (69.0%) were aware of HIV vaccine research, but less than half (43.8%) would accept an HIV vaccine if available. In multivariable analysis, higher educational attainment, &gt;5 sex partners, and TCM use were positively associated with HIV vaccine awareness. Culturally informed HIV vaccine preparedness in Taiwan may be supported by a complementary approach to TCM and HIV prevention technologies, tailoring information for MSM with lower education and targeting those at high risk through gay-identified CBOs.","165":"With HIV-infected patients living longer, there is an increased burden of comorbidities related to aging, HIV itself, and polypharmacy. Cardiac morbidity is of particular importance. This 2-group comparison study (156 HIV-positive and 105 HIV-negative patients) investigated the prevalence of abnormalities in and factors associated with an electrocardiogram (ECG) measure, corrected QT interval (QTc), where prolongation can lead to arrhythmia and sudden death. Medications prescribed (antiretroviral therapy, psychiatric medications, methadone, and antibiotics) at the time of ECG were noted. Patient characteristics, medications, QTc, and ECG characteristics were compared between the 2 groups. Prolongation (29% versus 19%) and extreme prolongation (6% versus 1%) in QTc were more frequent in those with HIV. Antiretroviral therapy was associated with lower odds of prolonged QTc (odds ratio [OR] = 0.35; P = .04), while methadone with higher odds (OR = 4.6; P = .01) in HIV-positive patients. With methadone and medication groups adjusted, HIV status was still associated with 17-millisecond longer QTc ( P = .04). This study provides evidence that patients with HIV may have clinically relevant longer QTc interval on ECG. Baseline and routine ECG monitoring may be warranted among patients living with HIV in clinical practice based on cumulative evidence. ","166":null,"167":"Uganda adopted Option B+ for prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) of HIV in 2012. However, there is limited data on preparedness and organization of Option B+ services. These data are critical in informing PMTCT programs and provision of universal antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all populations. This study explored health providers' experiences of preparedness and organization of Option B+ services in Central Uganda. Key informant interviews with 54 health providers from 6 health facilities in 3 districts were conducted. Thematic approach was employed to analyze data. Themes identified on preparedness were training of frontline health providers and provision of Option B+ guidelines, supervision and mentorship, and provision of essential medicines and medical health supplies, whereas those concerning organization were HIV counseling and testing, ART initiation, follow-up, and patient support mechanisms. Innovations like use of expert clients, assessing women's readiness to start Option B+, and retaining women in antenatal care clinic depending on the need are important in provision of Option B+. This study provides insights into preparedness and organization of Option B+ services which are important in provision of Option B+ and universal ART for all populations. Research around models of follow-up is recommended. ","168":null,"169":"This Perspective article provides a new view of frailty as it relates to HIV-1 infection. We discuss new findings and where our research is going.","170":null,"171":"Characterizing viral response to lopinavir\/ritonavir (LPV\/r) monotherapy as second-line treatment may guide recommendations for resource-limited settings (RLS). We conducted a 48-week prospective, single-arm study of LPV\/r monotherapy in patients failing first-line therapy in Nigeria. The primary outcome was sustained HIV-1 viral load (VL) &lt;400 copies\/mL at 48 weeks. Of 30 enrolled patients, 28 (93%) achieved viral suppression on LPV\/r, while 29 (96%) experienced low-level viremia. At 48 weeks, 9 (30%) met the primary outcome of sustained viral suppression; 14 (47%) patients were suppressed on LPV\/r in a snapshot analysis. Detectable VLs at 12 and 24 weeks were strongly associated with treatment failure at 48 weeks. New resistance mutations were not detected. The trial was stopped early due to treatment failure. In this study, the rate of virologic failure among patients on a second-line lopinavir monotherapy regimen was relatively high and predicted by early detectable viremia. However, no LPV\/r-associated resistance mutations were detected despite fluctuating low-level viremia, demonstrating the high genetic barrier to resistance of the protease inhibitor class which could be useful in RLS. ","172":"To examine the risk of hypomagnesemia of HIV-positive patients adherent to proton pump inhibitors (PPIs). A cohort study utilizing the Veterans Affairs Informatics and Computing Infrastructure was conducted on patients with (1) a complete antiretroviral therapy, (2) a serum magnesium measure during the study period, and (3) adherent to PPIs. Statistical analyses evaluated baseline characteristics between cohorts and a Cox proportional hazards model evaluating the association of hypomagnesemia while adjusting for baseline covariates. A total of 6047 patients met the study inclusion criteria, 329 patients in the PPI cohort and 5718 patients in the non-PPI cohort. The stratified Cox proportional hazards model results revealed that the risk of hypomagnesemia for the PPI cohort is 3.16 times higher compared to the non-PPI cohort (adjusted hazard ratio = 3.16, 95% confidence interval = 2.56-3.9). Proton pump inhibitors medication usage in HIV-positive patients is associated with a higher risk of hypomagnesemia compared to non-PPI patients. ","173":"A complex cultural dynamic within the Asian and Pacific Islander (APIs) population contributes to barriers in HIV care. This qualitative narrative study investigated how awareness, resource accessibility, and cultural taboo impact HIV care in APIs in Kansas. Eleven HIV-infected API patients were interviewed. Two evaluators independently completed a qualitative themes analysis. Important themes impacting HIV care included lack of awareness, sex as a taboo topic, and misconceptions about HIV infection. These factors create a closed community regarding HIV prevention and care. Clinicians must be aware of these barriers and provide specific culturally sensitive information and care to this population.","174":"Elvitegravir\/cobicistat\/emtricitabine\/tenofovir alafenamide (E\/C\/F\/TAF) is a potent fixed-dose, once-daily regimen for HIV-1 treatment and has rare emergence of drug resistance. We report a potential drug-drug interaction in 2 female patients both receiving treatment for HIV and cerebral toxoplasmosis: one case between E\/C\/F\/TAF with calcium carbonate and a second case involving leucovorin as calcium salt. Both cases resulted in rise in HIV RNA levels and emergence of M184 V mutation and resistance to elvitegravir and raltegravir. To the best of our knowledge, these 2 cases are the first reports of rapid emergence of mutation from coadministration of E\/C\/F\/TAF and calcium.","175":"This retrospective cohort study sought to assess the effectiveness of comprehensive geriatric assessment (CGA) for older patients at an HIV clinic in a large US city. We systematically reviewed medical records of all patients who underwent CGA from June 2013 to July 2017. In addition, physicians and social workers completed an anonymous survey about the impact of CGA on their patients. For the 76 patients (median age 67.2; Q1, Q3 = 60.9, 72.6) seen by geriatricians at the clinic, there were 184 recommendations, 54 instances of counseling, and 11 direct actions. Overall adherence to recommendations was 32.8%, 34.9% for patient-directed, and 31.7% for provider-directed recommendations. No demographic or CGA variables were associated with adherence. Despite this lack of adherence, surveyed providers reported that they usually or always followed recommendations; the most frequently cited barrier to implementation was lack of feasibility. Further research will be needed to determine how CGA can improve outcomes for this population.","176":"As per the National HIV Program in Peru, the designation of a patient-elected treatment supporter is a requisite for starting antiretroviral therapy (ART). These individuals are expected to aid the patient in medical and social support. This qualitative study examines the interaction between treatment supporters and people living with HIV\/AIDS (PLWHA) to elucidate key dynamics contributing to care. Twenty individual interviews with treatment supporters were analyzed alongside 5 group interviews: 2 groups of treatment supporters, 2 groups of PLWHA, and 1 group of community health workers. Findings characterized formal means of treatment support and informal emotional and instrumental support. Gradual transfer of treatment responsibilities from supporters to PLWHA was found to foster a sense of self-efficacy among PLWHA, and when paired with open communication and committed emotional support, created an ideal reciprocal relationship. However, lack of HIV-related knowledge among treatment supporters was detrimental. More training and systemic support for treatment supporters may optimize their role as informed participants in the care of PLWHA.","177":"Antiretroviral-related adverse drug reactions (ADRs) are one of the leading causes of drug changes, poor adherence, and treatment failure. Therefore, this study was designed to assess the magnitude of ADR and associated factors among pediatric patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART). A retrospective cross-sectional study was conducted by reviewing the medical records of pediatric patients on ART at Hiwot Fana Specialized University Hospital and Jugal Hospital ART clinics. The collected data were coded, entered, and analyzed using SPSS, IBM version 16. The associations of selected categorical variables were done using binary logistic and multivariate logistic regression. Of 186 medical records of pediatric patients on ART, 153 (82.25%) were reviewed. From the total medical records assessed, ADRs were observed in 23 (15.03%) of pediatric patients on ART, of which the most commonly encountered ADRs were anemia (34.8%) and followed by rash (17.4%). Most of ADRs were ranked as grade 3 (39.13%) and followed by grade 2 (30.4%) based on the degree of their severity. The likelihood of developing ADR was significantly associated with the regimen AZT\/3TC\/NVP (adjusted odds ratio: 6.420; 95% confidence interval: 1.056-39.018) relative to pediatric patients on D4T\/3TC\/NVP regimen. This study indicated that few pediatric patients on ART experienced ADRs. Most of the observed ADRs were ranked as grade 2 and 3 in terms of their severity. Drug out of stock and ADRs were the 2 most common reasons for antiretroviral (ARV) drug regimen change that could affect patient's treatment outcome and limited future option. ","178":"Molecular studies suggest that HIV arose in Africa between 1880 and 1940. During this period, there were campaigns by European colonial governments that involved unsterile injections of large numbers of Africans. That, along with other unsafe therapeutic interventions, may have propelled the evolution of HIV from SIV. Since subtype B in Africa may have been concentrated in white African homosexuals, it is possible that Westerners rather than Haitians introduced the virus to the New World. Amplification of HIV subtype B took place in Haiti, where transmission was facilitated by hazardous medical procedures including plasmapheresis. Representations in the media, however, largely ignore Western contributions to the spread of AIDS. This article focuses on the value of alternative narratives in fostering a balanced view that is less stigmatizing on developing nations.","179":"Non-nucleoside reverse-transcriptase inhibitor plus integrase strand transfer inhibitor-based dual therapies are an attractive simplification, nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-sparing strategy for experienced human immunodeficiency virus-infected patients. Thus, we performed a 24-week real-life observational study to assess efficacy and safety of switching from raltegravir plus etravirine to dolutegravir plus rilpivirine in 7 previously heavily treated patients. This simplification strategy reduced pill burden and preserved viral suppression in treatment-experienced patients with no major mutations to rilpivirine at historical genotyping.","180":null,"181":"The heightened vulnerability of adolescents to poor HIV care outcomes underscores the need for interventions that create and promote HIV self-management behavioral skills. Adolescents living with HIV (ALHIV) experience a complex array of physical, emotional, and social challenges that constrain their self-care, but the majority of existing psychosocial programs focus primarily on medication adherence. Understanding adolescents' self-care needs, challenges, and preferences is necessary for developing effective culturally relevant interventions. The involvement of caregivers and stakeholders is also critical to realizing positive self-care outcomes. This article presents the findings from focus group discussions with ALHIV, caregivers, and healthcare providers on self-care. The data were collected as part of formative research in the development of a self-management intervention for Ugandan ALHIV. Participants' discussions on self-care strategies and intervention approaches provide valuable insights to guide the development of interventions to promote positive HIV care outcomes among Ugandan ALHIV.","182":"HIV stigma affects many persons living with HIV in the United States, and reducing stigma is central to the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's (CDC) mission to promote health and prevent HIV transmission. To this end, CDC funds and implements programmatic activities, research, communication campaigns, and monitoring through data collection and public health surveillance. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention-funded programs have developed promising interventions and educational materials for reducing HIV stigma. Research conducted by CDC staff and their collaborators have made important contributions to the scientific literature on stigma, which have informed current CDC programmatic efforts, including public education activities and social marketing campaigns. By monitoring HIV stigma in multiple populations, CDC can evaluate the population-level effectiveness of stigma-reduction efforts and identify key populations in need of support and intervention. This article describes these and other recent CDC efforts to address HIV stigma, and discusses new strategies with the potential to further reduce stigma.","183":"The burden on health systems due to increased volume of patients with HIV continues to rapidly increase. The goal of this study was to examine the experiences of HIV care providers in a high patient volume HIV treatment and care program in eastern Africa. Sixty care providers within the Academic Model Providing Access to Healthcare program in western Kenya were recruited into this qualitative study. We conducted in-depth interviews focused on providers' perspectives on health system factors that impact patient engagement in HIV care. Results from thematic analysis demonstrated that providers perceive a work environment that constrained their ability to deliver high-quality HIV care and encouraged negative patient-provider relationships. Providers described their roles as high strain, low control, and low support. Health system strengthening must include efforts to improve the working environment and easing burden of care providers tasked with delivering antiretroviral therapy to increasing numbers of patients in resource-constrained settings.","184":"This observational study describes implementation of HIV retesting of HIV-negative women in prevention of mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) services in Zambia. Uptake of retesting and PMTCT services were compared across age, parity, and weeks of gestation at the time of the first HIV test, antiretrovirals regime, and HIV early diagnosis results from infants born to HIV-positive mothers. A total of 19 090 pregnant women were tested for HIV at their first antenatal visit, 16 838 tested HIV-negative and were offered retesting 3 months later: 11 339 (67.3%) were retested; of those, 55 (0.5%) were HIV positive. Uptake of the PMTCT package by women HIV positive at retest was not different but HIV-exposed infants born to women who retested HIV positive were infected at a higher rate (11.1%) compared to those born to women who tested HIV positive at their initial test (3.2%). We suggest rigorously (1) measuring the proportion of MTCT attributable to women who seroconvert during pregnancy and possibly adjust PMTCT approaches and (2) addressing the substantial loss to follow-up of HIV-negative pregnant women before HIV retesting. ","185":"HIV-related stigma creates barriers to HIV testing, medication adherence, and retention in care. Guided by the principles of community-based participatory research (CBPR) and in collaboration with community health workers (CHWs), the Stigma-reduction through Education, Empowerment, and Research (SEERs) project was developed with and for youth living in Nakuru, Kenya to reduce HIV-related stigma. The purpose of this qualitative study was to examine the experiences of the CHWs serving as SEERs facilitators. To evaluate SEERs, 37 facilitators completed open-ended survey questions to gather their experiences and recommendations for future program implementation and sustainability. Participants' mean age was 30.58 (standard deviation = 9.62), ranging from ages 18 to 53. Thematic content analysis was used to categorize (a) facilitators' experiences and the community impact of the SEERs project, (b) lessons learned, and (c) challenges to sustainability. Recommendations will be used to modify the SEERs project, improve implementation and sustainability strategies, and may provide guidance for similar CBPR projects.","186":"With efficacious behavioral, biomedical, and structural interventions available, combination implementation strategies are being implemented to combat HIV\/AIDS across settings internationally. However, priority statements from national and international bodies make it unclear whether the objective should be the reduction in HIV incidence or the maximization of health, most commonly measured with quality-adjusted life years (QALYs). Building off a model-based evaluation of HIV care interventions in British Columbia, Canada, we compare the optimal sets of interventions that would be identified using HIV infections averted, and QALYs as the primary outcome in a cost-effectiveness analysis. We found an explicit focus on averting new infections undervalues the health benefits derived from antiretroviral therapy, resulting in suboptimal and potentially harmful funding recommendations.","187":"Current HIV treatment guidelines recommend antiretroviral treatment (ART) initiation for all HIV-infected individuals regardless of CD4 count. This study evaluates the immunological and virological status and the clinical characteristics of patients who have started ART in the last 8 years in the Northwest of Spain. All HIV-infected patients who have started ART between January 2009 and December 2016 at a reference hospital in the Northwest of Spain were included in this retrospective observational study. Epidemiological, clinical, and immunovirological features and antiretroviral drugs used for initiation were recorded. A statistical analysis was performed using SPSS version 19 software. Categorical and continuous variables were compared by the specific statistical tests, and a logistic regression model was used to identify time associated with Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) categories change. A high proportion of HIV-infected patients (66.7%) had initiated ART with CD4 counts &lt;350 cells\/mm3 in the last 8 years. From these, most of them (68.3%) had &lt;350 CD4 counts at first contact with HIV specialist medical team, 12.2% had no indications for ART initiation in the last clinic visit before ART initiation according to the national guidelines at that moment, 11.0% were lost to follow-up because of lack of compliance with scheduled visits and 8.5% of patients refused treatment. A logistic regression model showed that a delay of one month since the first contact with HIV specialist medical team to ART initiation involves a risk of worsening in the CDC clinical category (odds ratio: 1.02 [95% confidence interval: 1.012-1.029]; P &lt; .001). A trend towards an earlier start of ART was observed during 2015 and 2016, likely influenced by the last treatment guidelines recommendations. High proportion of HIV-infected patients (66.7%) had initiated ART with CD4 counts &lt;350 cells\/mm3 in the last 8 years. The main reasons for this problem were analyzed and an important rate of late diagnosis was identified. However, a trend towards an earlier start of ART was observed during 2015 and 2016, likely influenced by the last treatment guidelines recommendations. These findings highlight the need to promote and facilitate HIV testing to reduce the late diagnosis as well as counseling on HIV prevention, treatment, and linkage care. ","188":"HIV\/AIDS prevalence rates in South Africa are among the highest in the world. The key to reducing transmission is the dissemination of accurate knowledge. Here, we investigate the accuracy of HIV\/AIDS knowledge among youth affected by the disease. Data from the Fourth South African National HIV, Behaviour and Health Survey (2012) are used and a weighted sample of 4 095 447 youth (15-24 years old) who have known or cared for someone with HIV\/AIDS are analyzed. Results show that more than one-third (40.37%) of youth in South Africa are affected by the disease. One-quarter of the affected youth have 75% accurate knowledge of the virus, while only 10% have 100% accurate knowledge. Rural place of residence (odds ratio [OR] = 0.61) and looking for work (OR = 0.39) are less likely to have accurate knowledge. Youth without disabilities (OR = 2.46), in cohabiting (OR = 1.69), and in dating (OR = 1.70) relationships are more likely to have accurate knowledge. In conclusion, in order to reduce HIV incidence and combat HIV myths, efforts to improve the accuracy of HIV knowledge among youth affected by the disease are needed. There should be more community-based campaigns to target unemployed youth in the country.","189":"This report describes a case of concomitant treatment of advanced diffuse large B-cell lymphoma with chemoimmunotherapy along with direct-acting antivirals for hepatitis C virus in a patient coinfected with HIV.

In order to achieve these goals, job satisfaction should be a priority for health care staff. This study examined the problems of health care personnel and the behavior of patients undergoing HIV\/AIDS counseling at Imam Khomeini Hospital in Tehran, Iran. Interviews were conducted individually with 5 health care personnel who participated in this study. Participants had 30 to 45 minutes each per session at the clinic, during which they were able to discuss the problems they faced in their careers. All conversations were officially recorded. The most common problems mentioned by these health care workers included the lack of safety and standardization of work conditions, the lack of appropriate equipment, limited space, high numbers of patients, low staffing levels and financial and morale problems compounded by the lack of support by hospital authorities. The authorities need to allocate more funds to provide facilities and appropriate working conditions for health care staff in order to increase job satisfaction and enable staff to provide the best services and care to HIV positive patients. ","192":"Beliefs that it is harmful to mix medications with alcohol (ie, interactive toxicity beliefs) are a known source of intentional antiretroviral therapy (ART) nonadherence. This study examined a serial process model of alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs, alcohol-ART avoidance behaviors, and ART adherence in the association between alcohol use and HIV viral load. Participants were 198 patients receiving ART from a community clinic in the southeastern United States; 125 reported current alcohol use. Results showed that current alcohol use was associated with detectable HIV viral load, partially accounted for by alcohol-ART interactive toxicity beliefs, alcohol-ART avoidance behaviors, and ART adherence. There was a significant indirect effect of the serial chain of interactive toxicity beliefs-avoidance behaviors-adherence, indicating the 3 intermediating variables partially accounted for the relationship between alcohol use and HIV viral load. Addressing alcohol use as a barrier to ART adherence requires multipronged approaches that address intentional nonadherence.","193":"We examined patterns of contraceptive utilization by HIV status among women in Cameroon, hypothesizing that women living with HIV would utilize contraception at higher rates than their HIV-negative peers. Deidentified, clinical data from the Cameroon Baptist Convention Health Services (2007-2013) were analyzed (N = 8995). Frequencies compared outcomes between women living with HIV (15.1%) and uninfected women. Multivariate analyses examined associates of contraceptive utilization and desire to become pregnant. Contraceptive utilization was associated with higher education, living with HIV, monogamy, and higher parity ( P &lt; .001). Women living with HIV had 66% higher odds of using contraceptives than their negative peers (odds ratio [OR]: 1.66, confidence interval [CI]: 1.45-1.91, P &lt; .001). Polygamous women had 37% lower odds of using contraceptives compared to monogamous women (OR: 0.63, 95% CI: 0.52-0.75, P &lt; .001). Increasing contraceptive utilization in resource-constrained settings should be a priority for clinicians and researchers. Doing so could improve population health by reducing HIV transmission between partners and from mother to child. ","194":"Adolescent girls and young women (AGYW) are highly affected by the HIV epidemic, yet standard approaches to pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) delivery will not meet their needs. This commentary highlights key characteristics of AGYW related to PrEP use and delivery, including typical neurocognitive development, lack of experience with sustained medication use, and the social and connected nature of AGYW's lives. We then suggest ways for programs to embrace these characteristics, such as presenting PrEP as a lifestyle choice and not a biomedical tool, making access to PrEP simple and easy, and recognizing the many influences AGYW face in taking PrEP. We also suggest ways for programs to identify AGYW at the highest risk of HIV acquisition. Adolescent girls and young women have an important role to play in ending the HIV epidemic and they deserve considerable, tailored investment.","195":"Thirty-day hospital readmissions, a key quality metric, are common among people living with HIV. We assessed perceived causes of 30-day readmissions, factors associated with preventability, and strategies to reduce preventable readmissions and improve continuity of care for HIV-positive individuals. Patient, provider, and staff perspectives toward 30-day readmissions were evaluated in semistructured interviews (n = 86) conducted in triads (HIV-positive patient, medical provider, and case manager) recruited from an inpatient safety net hospital. Iterative analysis included both deductive and inductive themes. Key findings include the following: (1) The 30-day metric should be adjusted for safety net institutions and patients with AIDS; (2) Participants disagreed about preventability, especially regarding patient-level factors; (3) Various stakeholders proposed readmission reduction strategies that spanned the inpatient to outpatient care continuum. Based on these diverse perspectives, we outline multiple interventions, from teach-back patient education to postdischarge home visits, which could substantially decrease hospital readmissions in this underserved population.","196":"We conducted a pilot of the Modified Antiretroviral Treatment Access Study (MARTAS), a linkage to HIV treatment intervention, prior to implementing a multisite randomized controlled trial (RCT) in Ukraine. The objectives of the pilot were to assess the feasibility and acceptability of the MARTAS intervention among a small sample of adults recently diagnosed with HIV at specialty clinics in the Mykolaiv region of Ukraine in 2015. The adapted intervention consisted of up to 6 individual-level sessions with a linkage coordinator (nurse) over a 90-day period. Overall, 22 persons participated in the pilot. On average, participants received 4.2 sessions and 14 participants linked to HIV care within 3 months of study enrollment. All 18 participants who completed the acceptability survey expressed high satisfaction with their interaction with their linkage coordinator. The results of the pilot demonstrated feasibility and acceptability of the MARTAS intervention in advance of a larger scale RCT in Ukraine.","197":"The use of lifelong antiretroviral therapy (ART) results in increased costs of care; the ability to finance and control sustained costs of ART needs to be discussed. The Southern Alberta Clinic initiated a practical cost savings approach that switched select patients from a branded ART to a less expensive generic variation. Our approach surveyed physicians and patients on their acceptance of switching and then launched a program asking patients if they would switch to generic variations for cost control purposes. Our early findings found &gt;50% of patients approached agreed to switch. We found no evidence of increased risk of viral breakthrough, resistance, side effects, or displeasure with generic drugs. Measured cost savings in the first year were &gt;$1.1 million with annual projected savings of between $4.3 million and $2.6 million (in 2017 Cdn$). Our approach can provide an option for controlling costs of HIV care without compromising quality. ","198":"There are growing concerns of tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF)-associated renal toxicity. We evaluated the effect of long-term TDF exposure on renal function in a cohort of HIV-1-infected Nigerians between 2006 and 2015. Multivariate logistic regression was used to identify predictors of renal impairment at different time over 144 weeks of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Data of 4897 patients, median age 42 years (interquartile range: 36-49), and 61% females were analyzed. The prevalence of renal impairment increased from 10% at week 24 to 45% at 144 weeks in TDF-exposed participants compared to an increase from 8% at 24 weeks to 14% at 144 weeks in TDF-unexposed participants. Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate exposure predicted the risk of renal impairment at 144 weeks of ART (odds ratio: 2.36; 95% confidence interval: 1.28-4.34). Long-term exposure to TDF-based ART significantly increases the likelihood of renal impairment. The continued use of TDF-based regimen in our setting should be reviewed. We recommend the urgent introduction of tenofovir alafenamide-based regimen in the HIV treatment guidelines of Nigeria and other resource-limited countries. ","199":"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders and other causes of neurocognitive challenges experienced by people living with HIV (PLWH) persist as public health concerns in developed countries. Consequently, PLWH who experience neurocognitive challenges increasingly require social support and mental health services from community-based providers in the HIV sector. Thirty-three providers from 22 AIDS service organizations across Ontario, Canada, were interviewed to determine the strategies they used to support PLWH experiencing neurocognitive difficulties. Thematic analysis was conducted to determine key themes from the interview data. Three types of strategies were identified: (a) intrapersonal, (b) interpersonal, and (c) organizational. Intrapersonal strategies involved learning and staying informed about causes of neurocognitive challenges. Interpersonal strategies included providing practical assistance, information, counseling, and\/or referrals to PLWH. Organizational strategies included creating dedicated support groups for PLWH experiencing neurocognitive challenges, partnering with other organizations with services not available within their own organization, and advocating for greater access to services with expertise and experience working with PLWH. Through concerted efforts in the future, it is likely that empirically investigating, developing, and customizing these strategies specifically to address HIV-associated neurocognitive challenges will yield improved social support and mental health outcomes for PLWH.

Data from 4098 FSWs collected under the Avahan-III baseline evaluation survey-2015 in 5 high HIV prevalence states (Maharashtra, Tamil Nadu, Karnataka, Telangana, and Andhra Pradesh) in India were used here. More than three-fifths (77%) were registered CO members, of whom 79% had been CO members for more than 1 year. The likelihood of having high financial security (19% versus 10%; adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 1.7; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.3-2.1) and social protection security (13% versus 6%; AOR: 1.6; 95% CI: 1.2-2.0) was 2 times higher among FSWs who were CO members compared to those who were not. The study offers important insights into furthering CO membership to address financial and social vulnerability as a path to a sustainable reduction of HIV risk.","201":"","202":"In 2016 to 2017, we surveyed primary care providers (PCPs) in upper Manhattan and the South Bronx, New York, on their knowledge, attitudes, and practices surrounding preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV. Despite efforts to promote survey response, we were only able to obtain a meager response rate, limiting our ability to interpret results. In this short communication, we examine our survey's methodology, as well as the methods used by other similar studies, in order to suggest how certain strategies appear to influence PCP response to PrEP surveys. Administering the survey in a variety of modes, sampling from a professional organization's listserv, promoting the survey topic's relevance to potential participants, and offering monetary incentives to each survey respondent all appear to be promising strategies for increasing response rates in PrEP provider surveys.","203":"","204":"Limited information is available on changing trends in HIV positive patients treated with first-line antiretroviral therapy from India.

Median age was 36 and 38 years in 06-07 and 10-12 groups, respectively. Median baseline CD4 count was 146 cells\/mL3 in the 10-12 group, and it was not significantly different from that of 06-07 group. Tuberculosis was diagnosed 3 times more commonly in the 10-12 group. The retention proportion at the end of 10 months was 68% in the 10-12 group when compared to that of 59% in the 06-07 group. There was a trend toward improved outcome over the period of time, but the attrition rate remained high. ","205":"Describing factors related to high attrition is important in order to improve the implementation of the Option B+ strategy in Haiti. We conducted a retrospective cohort study to describe the variability of antiretroviral therapy (ART) retention across health facilities among pregnant and lactating women and assess for differences in ART retention between Option B+ clients and other ART patients. There were 1989 Option B+ clients who initiated ART in 45 health facilities. The percentage of attrition varied from 9% to 81% across the facilities. The largest health facilities had 38% higher risk of attrition (relative risk [RR]: 1.38, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.08-1.77, P = .009). Private institutions had 18% less risk of attrition (RR: 0.82, 95% CI: 0.70-0.96, P = .020). Health facilities located in the West department and the South region had lower risk of attrition. Being on treatment in a large or public health facility or a facility located in the North region was a significant risk factor associated with high attrition among Option B+ clients. The implementation of the Option B+ strategy must be reevaluated in order to effectively eliminate mother-to-child HIV transmission. ","206":"Patient costs pose a challenge in accessing antiretroviral therapy for people living with HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. The study aimed at identifying drivers for out-of-pocket (OOP) costs in Tanzania. In 2009, 500 adult patients who attended 10 HIV clinics across 7 regions of Tanzania were asked about time and resources consumed to access HIV services. Bivariate and multivariate median regression models were used to determine the main drivers for OOP costs. Male and female patients have a median OOP costs of $40.37 and $28.01 per year, respectively ( P = .01). Males spend significantly more on travel ($26.51) than females ($19.68; P = .02). Living in rural areas and poor social economic status (SES) are associated with greater OOP costs ( P = .001) for both sexes. Poor SES and rural residence are main drivers of OOP costs. Patients are less likely to seek health care unless they are in dire need, leading to expensive services. ","207":"HIV-related stigma among nurses can impact health care services for people with HIV\/AIDS (PWHA). health care professionals' religious views can potentially foster stigmatizing attitudes. There is scarce scientific literature exploring the role of religion on HIV\/AIDS stigma among nurses. This study aimed to explore the role of religion in the stigmatization of PWHA by nurses in Puerto Rico. We conducted an exploratory study using qualitative techniques. We conducted 40 in-depth interviews with nurses who provided services to PWHA. Three main factors emerged in the analysis as contributors to HIV\/AIDS stigmatization: (1) nurses' personal religious experiences, (2) religion as a rationale for HIV-related stigma, and (3) religious practices during health care delivery. The results show that religious beliefs play a role in how nurses understood HIV\/AIDS and provided service. Results point toward the need for interventions that address personal religious beliefs while reducing HIV\/AIDS stigma among nurses.","208":"Rural women living with HIV\/AIDS (WLHA) in India experience challenges self-managing HIV\/AIDS in their rural communities. The purpose of this qualitative study was to explore factors influencing their care and antiretroviral treatment (ART) adherence. Themes that emerged from the qualitative focus groups among WLHA (N = 24) in rural Prakasam, Andhra Pradesh, India, included: (1) coming to know about HIV and other health conditions, (2) experiences being on ART, (3) challenges maintaining a nutritious diet, (4) factors affecting health care access and quality, and (5) seeking support for a better future. Chronic disease self-management in rural locales is challenging, given the number of barriers which rural women experience on a daily basis. These findings suggest a need for individual- and structural-level supports that will aid in assisting rural WLHA to self-manage HIV\/AIDS as a chronic illness.","209":null,"210":"We compared the demographic and disease characteristics of HIV-positive (HIV+) and HIV-negative (HIV-) individuals with a diagnosis of cancer in South Carolina.

However, high levels of adherence to ART are critical to maximize individual and public health benefits. We examined the nonclinical barriers to ART initiation for clinically eligible individuals and the provider- and patient-related factors associated with these barriers among HIV-infected patients in Houston\/Harris County, Texas. We analyzed data obtained from a probability sample of HIV medical care providers (HMCPs) in 13 outpatient facilities in Houston\/Harris County, Texas surveyed between June and September 2009. We used an inductive thematic approach to code HMCP responses to an open-ended question that asked the main reasons why providers may delay initiating ART for clinically eligible patients. The reasons cited by providers for delaying ART for clinically eligible patients were adherence (42.5%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 28.5-57.8), acceptance (30%; 95% CI: 18.1-45.4), and structural concerns (27.5%; 95% CI: 16.1-42.8), with significant variations ( P &lt; .0001) noted across patients' race\/ethnicity and transmission category. HIV medical care providers with 6 to 10 years' experience in HIV care and those providing medical care for more than 100 patients monthly were about 4 times (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 3.80; 95% CI: 1.20-5.92; P = .039) and 10 times (aOR: 10.36; 95% CI: 1.42-22.70; P = .019) more likely to state adherence and acceptance concerns, respectively, as reasons for delaying ART for clinically eligible patients. Our findings highlight the fact that clinical guidelines are only a starting point for medical decision-making process and that patients themselves play an important role.

We aimed to define the risk of neurocognitive dysfunction among smokers relative to nonsmokers. We conducted a retrospective cohort study including HIV-infected adults ages 21 to 65 years. The Mental Alternation Test (MAT) was the primary outcome. The odds of cognitive impairment were compared using random-effects logistic regression to adjust for potential confounders. Of 3033, 1486 (49%) were smokers. The odds ratio for the association between smoking and cognitive impairment was 1.12 (95% confidence interval: 0.85-1.49). Nonsmokers had a higher median MAT score relative to smokers ( P = .01). There was no evidence that HIV-infected smokers had greater neurocognitive dysfunction relative to HIV-infected nonsmokers.

Patients with cutaneous adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to ARV\/antitubercular drugs and who underwent oral DPT during a 5-year period were included in this study. Data were collected from the records of 21 patients. Of the 21, 19 had HIV infection. The most commonly implicated drug was nevirapine (NVP), followed by cotrimoxazole and antitubercular agents. Of the 11 ADRs that occurred on rechallenge, the ADR on rechallenge was similar in clinical presentation to the initial ADR in 6 patients, while a different rash was elicited in 5 patients. Oral DPT is a safe and effective tool to accurately diagnose ADRs, especially in patients on multiple drugs and in situations such as HIV infection and tuberculosis where second-line agents are expensive and\/or not easily available through the national AIDS control\/tuberculosis programs.

Ear secretion specimens were collected by syringe or cotton swabs. Isolated bacteria were subjected to antibiotic sensitivity tests. Of 290 recruited PLH, 81.7% were females and 18.3% males; their CD4+ counts ranged from 0 to 1770. Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Escherichia coli were the predominant bacteria. High antibiotic resistance was detected on Streptococcus pyogenes and Streptococcus pneumoniae. The prevalence rate of OM-associated bacteria (OAB) was 93.4%, and majority of the bacteria were resistant to multiple antibiotics. Linear association between the prevalence of OAB with both duration of ART and CD4+ counts was observed. High prevalence rates of OAB and antibiotic resistance were observed. Negative correlation between CD4+ counts and prevalence of OAB was revealed.

We examined the pre-ART period to identify and assess factors associated with outcomes of pre-ART care. Four modes of transition out of pre-ART care were considered. Beta estimates from the competing risks Cox models were used to investigate whether the effects of covariates differed by mode of transition. Median CD4 counts at entry showed no meaningful change over time. Advanced disease progression and presence of opportunistic infections were significant predictors of pre-ART mortality. Men were more likely to die before initiating ART, transfer to another facility, or be lost to follow-up than were women. Removing CD4 thresholds is not likely to substantially reduce program mortality prior to ART initiation unless and until patients enroll earlier in disease progression.

We conducted a retrospective chart review of adult PLHIV on MVC based Antiretroviral (ARV) regimens for at least 6 months. Maraviroc was initiated amongst PLHIV with documented R5 tropic viruses (determined by in-house population sequencing of the V3 loop in triplicate and interpreted using the Geno2Pheno algorithm) in combination with an Optimized Background regimen (designed using genotypic resistance testing and past ARV history). Plasma viral loads (PVL) are performed 6 months post-initiation and annually thereafter. Primary outcome d. Median duration on MVC treatment was 1.8 years (range 1-2.9 years) while median duration of ART prior to switching to MVC was 13 years. Maraviroc was combined with Darunavir\/ritonavir (DRV\/r) (n=10), Atazanavir\/r (ATV\/r) (n=2) and Lopinavir\/r (LPV\/r) (n=1). All PLHIV were infected with HIV-1 Subtype C. Only 23.3% PLHIV achieved virologic suppression at 6 months and sustained it for 2.3 years. Median CD4 count change from baseline was +117 (n=13), +228 (n=10), +253 (n=9), and +331 (n=4) at 6, 12, 18 and 24 months respectively. Repeat tropism among patients with virologic failure demonstrated R5 virus. High rates of virologic failure was seen when MVC was used amongst treatment experienced PLHIV infected with HIV-1 Subtype C in India. was the proportion of PLHIV with virologic success (PVL&lt;50 copies\/ml) at last follow up visit. Data on 13 PLHIV were analyze. ","223":"Antiretroviral treatment adherence barriers are major concerns in HIV care. They are multiple and change over time. Considering temporality in patients' perceptions of adherence barriers could improve adherence management. We explored how temporality manifests itself in patients' perceptions of adherence barriers. We conducted 2 semi-structured focus groups on adherence barriers with 12 adults with HIV which were analyzed with grounded theory. A third focus group served to validate the results obtained. Three temporal categories were manifest in HIV-positive patients' perceptions of barriers: (1) imprinting (events with lasting impacts on patients), (2) domino effects (chain of life events), and (3) future shadowing (apprehension about long-term adherence). An overarching theme, weathering (gradual erosion of abilities to adhere), traversed these categories. These temporalities explain how similar barriers may be perceived differently by patients. They could be useful to providers for adapting their interventions and improving understanding of patients' subjective experience of adherence.","224":"Evidence on the use of short message service (SMS) to improve medication adherence in people living with HIV (PLHIV) is mounting, yet qualitative research on patient perceptions regarding SMS content and utility for HIV\/AIDS remains nascent. To explore the experience of receiving medication reminders via SMS among PLHIV, 45 uninsured and underinsured PLHIV nested within the intervention arm of a larger study received daily, 1-way SMS adherence reminders. Qualitative data were collected by face-to-face, structured interview and were analyzed using conventional content analysis methods. Three main themes emerged from the data: (1) reminders helping with adherence, (2) concerns about delivery modes, and (3) the need for confidentiality. Study findings offer enhanced focus on an emerging strategy in patient-centered HIV care: Equipped with greater context on the experiences of PLHIV using SMS adherence reminders, health-care providers can offer more targeted support and thereby maximize the benefits of this popular and powerful technology.","225":"People living with HIV may experience disability which is episodic in nature, characterized by periods of wellness and illness. The purpose of this longitudinal qualitative study was to understand how the episodic nature of HIV and the associated uncertainty shape the disability experience of older adults living with HIV over time. Fourteen men and 10 women who were HIV positive and over 50 years (mean age: 57 years; range: 50-73) participated in 4 interviews over 20 months. Longitudinal analyses of the transcribed interviews identified 4 phenotypes of episodic disability over time: decreasing, increasing, stable, or significant fluctuations. Although all participants experienced uncertainty, acceptance and optimism were hallmarks of those whose phenotypes were stable or improved over time. Understanding a person's episodic trajectory may help to tailor interventions to promote stability, mitigate an upward trajectory of increasing disability, and increase the time between episodes of illness.","226":"Patients with drug-resistant HIV often require complex antiretroviral regimens. However, combining fixed-dose combination tablets such as tenofovir-disoproxil-fumarate, emtricitabine, and cobicistat-boosted elvitegravir (TDF\/FTC\/EVG\/cobi) with darunavir (DRV) can provide a simple, once-daily (QD), 2-tablet regimen for patients with drug-resistant HIV. Primary objective was to determine the percentage of patients with HIV-1 RNA &lt;40 copies\/mL at 48 weeks. We performed a retrospective chart review of patients initiated on TDF\/FTC\/EVG\/cobi plus DRV. Among the 21 included patients, prior resistance showed a median of 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations, 1 nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase mutation, and 1 protease inhibitor mutation. At week 48, 14 (67%) patients achieved HIV-1 RNA &lt;40 copies\/mL, 1 patient experienced viral rebound, and 6 (29%) had missing data or discontinued therapy. No patient discontinued for adverse events. According to this observational study, QD TDF\/FTC\/EVG\/cobi plus DRV is considered safe, well tolerated, and generally effective in suppressing HIV drug-resistant virus. ","227":"Physicians are not routinely offering patients HIV testing, partly due to perceived patient discomfort with discussing HIV. This study assessed patients' comfort level and whether physician recommendations can overcome any discomfort that does exist. In a publicly funded primary care clinic, we administered a survey exploring patient facilitators to HIV testing, with 266 patients answering the 2 main survey questions of interest. Most participants wanted their physician to offer HIV testing (n = 175; 65.8%). Even among participants who did not want their physician to offer HIV testing (n = 91), over half (n = 54; 59.3%) reported they would \"likely\" or \"very likely\" accept HIV testing if their physician recommended it. Based on our findings, not only are negative attitudes about HIV testing among patients uncommon but physician recommendations may be able to convince patients to receive HIV testing in spite of patients stating they do not want the test.","228":"With the increasing number of HIV-infected patients receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), the shift in their dermatologic profile becomes less characteristic of AIDS-defining illnesses. Retrospective review of mucocutaneous pathology among patients seen at HIV-Dermatology Clinic from January 2009 to December 2013. Among 534 patients, there were 68.4% males and 31.6% females, with 8.7-year average duration of infection; 82.8% were receiving HAART. Kaposi sarcoma was the only relatively frequent AIDS-defining disease. Fungal and viral infections were common, with human papilloma virus (HPV) as the most frequent overall. Benign and premalignant tumors were associated with HAART and CD4 &gt;200\/mm3 ( P &lt; .05). Psoriasis was prevalent among patients without HAART ( P &lt; .05). Prurigo was associated with lower CD4 count ( P &lt; .001). Patients receiving HAART are faced with chronic skin problems such as benign and premalignant tumors, and HPV infection adds to their neoplastic predisposition. Further research is recommended to develop protocols for treating psoriasis and screening for HPV-associated neoplasia among patients. ","229":null,"230":"The prevalence of non-AIDS-related comorbidities is increasing in HIV-infected patients receiving antiretroviral therapy. In Thailand, data regarding the prevalence of non-AIDS comorbidities and factors associated with metabolic complications in HIV-infected patients have not been well-documented. This cross-sectional study was conducted in 2011 and included 874 HIV-infected patients. The age of patients was 45(8) years represented as mean (standard deviation [SD]). The current CD4 count was 502(247) cells\/mm3. In all, 388 (44%) of the included patients had at least 1non-AIDS comorbidity. The most frequently documented comorbidities were hyperlipidemia in 271 (70%) patients. Using multivariate analysis, older age(odds ratio [OR] = 1.82, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.51-2.19), male sex (OR = 1.55, 95%CI = 1.14-2.11), high current CD4 count(OR = 1.00, 95%CI = 1.00-1.00), and taking abacavir (ABC)-containing(OR = 2.59, 95%CI = 1.16-5.78)and didanosine (ddI)-containing antiretroviral regimens (OR = 4.16, 95%CI = 1.09-15.84)were associated with the presence of metabolic complications (all Ps&lt;.05). The prevalence of comorbidities is substantially high. Clinical monitoring and effective management of these comorbidities and metabolic complications are recommended, especially in HIV-infected patients who present with these associated factors. ","231":"Obesity is common among patients with HIV. The objective of this study was to characterize response to antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a cohort of obese incarcerated adults compared to a nonobese cohort. A retrospective matched cohort study was conducted in an HIV telemedicine clinic. Patients with body mass index (BMI) &gt;30 kg\/m2 who received the same ART with &gt;95% adherence for at least 6 months were matched to nonobese patients by age, gender, ART, CD4 count, and viral load at baseline. Twenty pairs were included, with an average BMI of 24 kg\/m2 in the nonobese cohort and 35 kg\/m2 in the obese cohort. No difference was observed in the proportion of patients who achieved virologic suppression or the change in CD4 count from baseline to 6 to 12 months. This study revealed no differences in immunologic recovery or virologic suppression between obese and nonobese patients in an adult correctional population. ","232":null,"233":null,"234":null,"235":"In September 2015, the World Health Organization updated their guidelines to recommend antiretroviral therapy (ART) for all people living with HIV. Countries are now in the process of implementing strategies to provide universal HIV treatment. We analyzed the rate of retention and time to ART eligibility (according to 2013 WHO guidelines) among 3,345 adult patients receiving positive HIV test results between February 1, 2003 and March 31, 2013 at the GHESKIO Clinic in Haiti, with WHO stage 1 or 2 disease and initial CD4 cell count &gt;500 cells\/mm3. Among the 3,345 patients, 2,423 (72%) were female, the median age was 33 years, 3,089 (92%) lived in Port-au-Prince, and 1,944 (58%) had attended no school or primary school only. The median initial CD4 cell count was 668 cells\/mm3 (IQR: 572-834); over the subsequent 2 years, 1,485 patients (44%) were lost to follow-up and 7 (&lt;1%) died pre-ART, 1,041 (31%) were retained in pre-ART care, and 819 (24%) initiated ART. In multivariate analysis, secondary education (aOR 1.27; 95% CI: 1.10-1.47), female gender (aOR: 1.28; 95% CI: 1.09-1.50), co-habitation (aOR: 1.31; 95% CI: 1.09-1.57), and residence in Port-au-Prince (aOR: 1.43; 95% CI: 1.09-1.88) were associated with retention in care. The median time from baseline CD4 count to ART eligibility was 1.7 years. Prior to the implementation of universal treatment, pre-ART attrition was high among patients who did not qualify for ART at presentation. Though implementing WHO recommendations for universal ART will require service expansion, it will likely result in improved retention for those at risk of being lost to follow-up.","236":"Repeat HIV testing after receiving a positive result has never been studied systematically and may give insight into reasons for delayed linkage to care. Among 831 adults in 6 secondary facilities in Oromia, Ethiopia, who completed an interviewer-administered structured questionnaire within 2 weeks of initiating antiretroviral therapy in 2012 to 2013, 110 (13.2%) reported having retested after an HIV-positive result. The odds of repeat (versus single) HIV-positive testing were higher among those who had doubted their HIV status (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]ref=nodoubt = 6.5; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 3.7-11.4) and those who initially tested at another facility, whether another secondary facility (AOR ref=studyfacility = 22.7; 95% CI: 11.0-46.9) or a lower-level facility (AORref=studyfacility = 19.1; 95% CI: 10.5-34.5). The odds of repeat (versus single) HIV-positive testing were lower among those who initially tested because of symptoms (AORref=not a reason = 0.40; 95% CI: 0.24-0.66). Median time between initial diagnosis and enrollment in care was 12.3 versus 1.0 month for repeat and single HIV-positive testers, respectively ( P &lt; .001). Repeat HIV-positive testing-not a rare occurrence-appears to stem from doubt, seeking care at a facility other than where diagnosed, and testing for a reason other than having symptoms. Because repeat HIV-positive testing is associated with delay in linkage to care, providers should be aware of this potential when counseling those who test HIV positive.","237":"Combination prevention efforts are now recommended toward reducing HIV incidence among men who have sex with men (MSM). Understanding the perceptions of both MSM and service providers is critical to informing the development of prevention packages and ultimately improving intervention effectiveness. This study assessed the preferences of MSM and health service providers in the administration of HIV-prevention efforts. Qualitative data were gathered from a series of separate MSM and health care provider focus groups in 2 South African cities. Participants discussed HIV-prevention services and MSM client experiences within South Africa and identified the 3 most important clinic characteristics and 3 most important HIV-prevention services for MSM clients. Priorities indicated by both MSM and health care providers were confidentiality of visit, friendly staff, and condoms, while discrepancies existed between MSM and providers regarding provider consistency and the provision of pre-exposure prophylaxis\/post-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP\/PEP) and lubricant as prevention methods. Effective interventions must address these discrepancies through the design of intervention and provider training to optimally accommodate MSM.","238":"Iatrogenic Cushing syndrome (CS) is a well-known complication of treating patients with systemic steroids. More rarely, it has been described in HIV-positive patients on ritonavir (RTV) while using the inhaled corticosteroid fluticasone, which is metabolized through the cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) enzyme system. In the presence of RTV, a known CYP3A4 enzyme inhibitor, the interaction can result in impaired metabolism and systemic accumulation of inhaled fluticasone resulting in iatrogenic CS. Iatrogenic CS has been less often described with inhaled budesonide compared to inhaled fluticasone. Therefore, inhaled budesonide is often used as an alternative therapy for patients on RTV to avoid iatrogenic CS. We report the fifth case report of budesonide-induced iatrogenic CS in an HIV-positive patient on RTV. We highlight the importance of early recognition of the syndrome and distinguishing it from HIV lipodystrophy. Finally, we review the literature for cases of iatrogenic CS involving RTV and commonly used steroids.","239":null,"240":"This study represents one of the few exploring the effectiveness of an integrated HIV nurse navigation program on engagement and virologic outcomes. A navigator provided individualized care management (eg, pillbox renewals), intensive outreach, and collaboration with existing support systems (eg, families, community programs). Clinical data from the Veterans Affairs (VA) Medical Center site of a longitudinal, observational study of HIV in the District of Columbia (DC) cohort were used for comparison (N = 706). Navigation patients (n = 84) were less likely to have permanent housing, and more likely to be disabled, have detectable viral load, comorbid depressive, and substance use disorders. Navigation patients showed improvements in clinic visits (doubled), rate of medication renewal (40.91% to 80.61%), CD4 count and CD4%, and viral rates of Veterans with &lt;200 copies\/mL increased from 47.6% to 69.0% after one year. Integration of nurse navigation into a HIV primary care setting shows promise in improving engagement and virologic suppression in a high-risk population.","241":null,"242":"Little is known about the dynamics of condom use among female sex workers (FSWs) in Iran. We investigated the correlates of consistent condom use (CCU) among FSWs, using data from a national biobehavioral surveillance survey in 2010. A total of 872 FSWs were recruited using a facility-based sampling strategy from 21 sites in 13 cities in Iran. Data were collected through face-to-face interviews using a standardized questionnaire. Overall, 33.6% and 17.3% of FSWs reported CCU with paying and nonpaying sex partners, respectively. Consistent condom use with paying partners was significantly associated with temporary marriage, accessing family planning services and history of working in brothels. Conversely, temporary marriage or married status, condom rupture\/slippage, and HIV seropositivity remained independently significantly associated with CCU with nonpaying sex partners. Our findings indicated the urgent need for scaling up condom promotion interventions catered toward FSWs and their sex partners to practice safe sex consistently. ","243":"Coccidioidomycosis causes substantial morbidity and mortality in endemic areas, and dissemination is frequent in patients with impaired cellular immunity such as AIDS. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) is paradoxical clinical worsening after initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a patient with HIV and a simultaneous opportunistic infection (OI). Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome has been well described for a host of mycobacterial, viral, and fungal OIs and malignancies such as Kaposi sarcoma. To date, only 3 cases of IRIS due to coccidioidomycosis have been reported in the literature. At our institution, we report 4 cases of IRIS in HIV-infected patients with disseminated coccidioidomycosis. Unfortunately, all 4 patients died of worsening coccidioidal infection after initiating ART. The optimal timing of ART in patients with AIDS and coccidioidomycosis remains to be elucidated.","244":"Little is known about clinicians' adoption of recommendations of the International Association of Providers of AIDS Care and others for supporting adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We surveyed a probability sample of US HIV care providers to estimate the percentage offering 3 ART adherence support services to most or all patients and assessed the characteristics of providers offering all 3 services (comprehensive support) to most or all patients. Almost all providers (95.5%) discussed ART adherence at every visit, 60.1% offered advice about tools to increase adherence, 53.5% referred nonadherent patients for supportive services, and 42.8% provided comprehensive support. Nurse practitioners were more likely to offer comprehensive support as were providers who practiced at Ryan White HIV\/AIDS Program-funded facilities, provided primary care, or started caring for HIV-infected patients within 10 years. Less than half of HIV care providers offered comprehensive ART adherence support. Certain subgroups may benefit from interventions to increase delivery of adherence support. ","245":null,"246":"With the introduction of combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) worldwide, youth with perinatal HIV infection are increasingly surviving childhood and transitioning to adult care. Although a normal life span is anticipated posttransition, successful transition to adult HIV care has proven difficult, with worse outcomes posttransition than in pediatric and adult care. This study is a qualitative analysis of data from 4 focus groups of pre- and posttransition patients, caregivers, and healthcare providers in the Dominican Republic at an institution that provides comprehensive treatment including ART for HIV-infected persons of all ages. All groups discussed the problems and challenges that patients, caregivers, and providers experience while living the transition process and beyond. Five major themes emerged: the trauma of transition itself, ART adherence, experience and impact of stigma, social supports and barriers, and recommendations for improving outcomes. Participants' insights offered approaches for a versatile structured transition process.","247":"We report the first identified case of suspected iatrogenic adrenal insufficiency after an interlaminar injection of triamcinolone acetonide while on concomitant Stribild (elvitegravir 150 mg\/cobicistat 150 mg\/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate 300 mg\/emtricitabine 200 mg [EVG\/c\/TDF\/FTC]). A 49-year-old female with HIV on EVG\/c\/TDF\/FTC therapy presented to our endocrinology clinic to be evaluated for suspected Cushing syndrome. Prior to presentation, the patient had been given 2 interlaminar spinal injections of triamcinolone. Thereafter, she developed a swollen face, had unexplained weight gain, and fatigue. Cosyntropin stimulation test was positive for adrenal insufficiency. By applying the Naranjo Nomogram for Causality and the Drug Interaction Probability Scale to this drug-drug interaction, we calculated a score of 6 ( probable) and 5 ( probable), respectively. Symptoms resolved without further intervention. The EVG\/c\/TDF\/FTC contains cobicistat, a strong cytochrome P450 3A4 (CYP3A4) inhibitor, which can potentiate drug interactions involving metabolizing of medications via this pathway. Clinicians are reminded to be vigilant while assessing the potential pharmacokinetic drug interactions not mentioned by the manufacturer.","248":"Limited health literacy is common among persons infected with HIV and has been linked to poor mental and physical health outcomes, but there are no well-validated screening measures of health literacy in this vulnerable clinical population. The present study evaluates the usefulness of the Newest Vital Sign (NVS) as a brief measure of health literacy in HIV disease. Seventy-eight HIV+ adults were administered the NVS, Rapid Estimate of Adult Literacy in Medicine (REALM), and Single Item Literacy Screener (SILS). Main criterion variables included plasma HIV viral load, medication management capacity, self-efficacy for medication management, and perceived relationships with healthcare providers. The NVS showed good internal consistency and moderate correlations with the REALM and SILS. Rates of limited health literacy were highest on the NVS (30.3%) as compared to SILS (6.6%) and REALM (9.2%). A series of regressions controlling for education showed that the NVS was incrementally predictive of viral load, medication management capacity and self-efficacy, and relationships with healthcare providers, above and beyond the REALM and SILS. The NVS shows evidence of reliability, convergent validity, and incremental criterion-related validity and thus may serve as useful screening tool for assessing health literacy in HIV disease. ","249":"In total, 679 HIV-positive patients from 4 clinics in Urumqi city were given structured questionnaires by the doctors or nurses treating them. Health-related quality of life (HRQL) was assessed using the Chinese Patient-Reported Outcome Quality of Life-HIV questionnaire versions in Mandarin and Uyghur. This tool has been used in other parts of China and several countries. Compared to France, Australia, United States, Brazil, Thailand, Cambodia, Senegal, and Central-Southern China (CS China), the HRQL was significantly lower among HIV-positive patients in Xinjiang, with regard to the dimension of treatment impact and general health score. The health concern was similar to Brazil and Cambodia but lower than other countries and CS China. Our findings showed high stigmatization: 86% of the patients were afraid to tell others they were HIV positive and 69% often felt or always felt depressed. Only 1% of the patients were on antidepressant treatment.","250":"Drug-dependent women are the vulnerable population deprived of access to health services and also have particular relevance to public health perspective because they are important bridge population for driving HIV\/AIDS epidemic. This qualitative study aimed to explore the perception of drug-dependent women regarding HIV testing. In this qualitative study, we approached 23 women with substance use disorders in 2 of the selected drop-in centers in the south Tehran. Focus group discussion, face-to-face semistructured interviews, and field notes were used to collect the data. Qualitative content analysis was used to extract the explanatory model of women's perceptions about HIV testing. Four main themes emerged from the data: forgotten health during use, having misconception, and sharing of sexual partner in secrecy and concerns. Seven subthemes were extracted, including not being sex worker, point of ruin, voluntary selection and concerns about fear of abandonment and fear of loss and death, double concern, and future of children. Beliefs and values of drug-dependent women can be positive points leading them to do an HIV test, and misconceptions of these women would be corrected by using safe behavioral skills training. ","251":"Despite the fact that the origin of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) being a contamination and a mutation originating from primates is well-documented alternative narratives are often being heard ofespecially in sub-Saharan Africa. One such narrative is about HIV being man-made in a military laboratory in the United States. In this article, it is shown how this narrative was fabricated by the intelligence services in East Germany (German Democratic Republic - GDR) as part of the ideological warfare during the Cold War. The purpose of this article is to put an end to a long-lasting conspiracy theory, which is still alive and may create diversion from serious research on the topic.","252":"Positive health, dignity, and prevention (PHDP) is Mozambique's strategy to engage clinicians in the delivery of prevention messages to their HIV-positive clients. This national implementation strategy uses provider trainings on offering key messages and focuses on intervening on 9 evidence-based risk reduction areas. We investigated the impact of longitudinal technical assistance (TA) as an addition to this basic training. We followed 153 healthcare providers in 5 Mozambican provinces over 6 months to evaluate the impact of on-site, observation-based TA on PHDP implementation. Longitudinal multilevel models were estimated to model change in PHDP message delivery over time among individual providers. With each additional TA visit, providers delivered about 1 additional PHDP message ( P &lt; .001); clinicians and nonclinicians started at about the same baseline level, but clinicians improved more quickly ( P = .004). Message delivery varied by practice sector; maternal and child health sectors outperformed other sectors. Longitudinal TA helped reach the programmatic goals of the PHDP program in Mozambique. ","253":"There is an urgent need to develop the HIV treatment cascade for men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender individuals in rural Mpumalanga, South Africa. Mhealth tools such as smartphone applications have the potential to support HIV self-care behaviors. We conducted an exploratory study with HIV-positive community leaders to understand their current uses of cell phones and smartphones and to assess their interest in an HIV research study that utilized a smartphone application for HIV care support. A total of 18 community leaders were recruited to complete a questionnaire and focus group. We found that a large proportion of participants had smartphone access and were interested in a research study that utilized a smartphone application with secure access measures. We conclude that smartphone applications for HIV care research are feasible based on access and interest by MSM and transgender individuals in this rural setting.","254":"Evidence-based guidelines recommend that HIV care providers offer retention-in-care services, but data are needed to assess service provision. We surveyed a probability sample of 1234 HIV care providers to estimate the percentage of providers whose practices offered 5 recommended retention services and describe providers' perceptions of barriers to care among patients. An estimated 21% of providers' practices offered all 5 retention services. Providers at smaller (&lt;50 versus &gt;400 patients), private, and non-Ryan White HIV\/AIDS Program (RWHAP)-funded practices, and practices without on-site case management were significantly less likely to provide patient navigation services or do systematic monitoring of retention. Providers' most commonly perceived barriers to care among patients were mental health (40%), substance abuse (36%), and transportation (34%) issues. Deficiencies in the provision of key retention services are substantial. New strategies may be needed to increase the delivery of recommended retention services, especially among private, non-RWHAP-funded, and smaller facilities. ","255":"The role of sexual function and its impact on HIV management have been inadequately evaluated. A cross-sectional study in 2009 of 202 patients with HIV were recruited to examine sexual function and psychosocial\/HIV management factors. Analyses assessed the relationship between sexual function, sociodemographic factors, biomedical markers, and depressive symptomology. The M-Estimator compared differences in the means of the HIV, cancer survivors, and the normative cohorts. More than 75% were on combination antiretroviral therapy, of which 70% had suppressed HIV viral loads. Patients with unsuppressed HIV viral loads reported lower rates of arousal. Better overall health was associated with higher rates of overall sexual function, arousal, and interest. Compared to the normative and cancer survivor cohorts, mean sexual function was significantly lower in the HIV-infected cohort in all subscales, except for masturbation. These findings suggest lower sexual function impacts individuals with HIV in ways related to negative biomedical and psychosocial factors.","256":"Millions of people worldwide take tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (TDF) for the treatment of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and\/or hepatitis B infection. Although generally safe and well tolerated, clinicians need to be aware that TDF can cause proximal renal tubular dysfunction and loss of bone mineral density, especially in patients with concomitant renal disease or other risk factors. We present the case of a patient with chronic HIV infection and urethral stricture who developed TDF-related proximal renal tubular dysfunction with hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia, presenting with bone pains, skeletal deformity, and disability. We review risk factors for TDF-related renal tubular toxicity and recommendations for monitoring creatinine, phosphate, alkaline phosphatase, and urinalysis.","257":"Past studies of barriers to HIV care have not comprehensively assessed psychiatric symptoms, and few have assessed barriers to care among people living with HIV (PLWH) who are lost to care (LTC). We examined psychiatric symptoms, barriers to HIV care, and immune functioning in PLWH who were retained in care (RIC; n = 21) or LTC (n = 21). Participants completed diagnostic interviews for posttraumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and other psychiatric disorders, self-report measures of HIV risk behaviors and psychiatric symptoms, and a blood draw to assess viral load. Compared to RIC participants, LTC participants met criteria for a greater number of psychiatric disorders and reported greater depressive symptoms and more barriers to HIV care. There were no group differences in PTSD severity, risk behaviors, or viral load, suggesting that LTC individuals experience greater psychiatric problems and perceive more barriers to care than RIC participants, but are not less likely to have achieved viral suppression.","258":null,"259":"In sub-Saharan Africa, few studies exist on elderly HIV-positive populations. Therefore, we aimed to examine the profiles of elderly people living with HIV (PLHIV) in Burkina Faso and their response to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We reviewed the monitoring and treatment of PLHIV over the age of 50 years and then compared with the monitoring and treatment of PLHIV under 50 years. A total of 3367 patients were included. The median age of elderly people was 54.5 years and of young people was 34.9 years ( P = .03). In both the groups, screening was performed following clinical suspicion (64.9% in elderly versus 56% in young people; P &lt; .001). Cardiovascular risk factors were generally more significant in the elderly people. The risk of death while on ART was 2.3 times higher in elderly people ( P &lt; .001). HIV infection in older people occurs in those who already have some cardiovascular risk factors. Particular attention should be given to multidisciplinary care for the elderly individuals. ","260":"Human papillomavirus (HPV) infection, widely known as the necessary cause of cervical cancer, has been established as a major etiologic factor for head and neck cancer (HNC). HIV-infected individuals are at higher risk of HPV-associated cancers than the general population. We describe a 45-year-old man with HIV and HPV coinfection, who presented progressively enlarging verrucous neoformations of the lips. The final diagnosis of verrucous carcinoma was delayed. Early detection of HPV lesions in oral mucosa and HPV screening activities could be important in improving the diagnostic sensitivity for the HIV-infected patients with oral cancer.","261":null,"262":"In accordance with global HIV\/AIDS goals, Mozambique is attempting to improve management of antiretroviral treatment failure (TF). We sought to determine whether the utilization of a national HIV\/AIDS clinician telephone consultation service increased recognition and reporting of TF. In a retrospective analysis of routinely collected program data from telephone consultation logs and Mozambique's national registry of second-line antiretroviral requests, we used linear mixed methods to describe the association between TF-related telephone consultations and submission of second-line requests, which required documentation of the TF diagnosis. The unit of analysis was the health facility. Available data included 1417 consultations (390 [27.5%] TF related) and 2662 second-line requests from 1011 health units (2015-2016 data). In multivariable analyses, each TF-related consultation was associated with an increase of 0.61 (95% confidence interval 0.15 to 1.06) second-line requests. In this setting, TF-related telephone consultation was positively and significantly associated with diagnosis and reporting of antiretroviral TF.","263":"With the wide usage of highly active antiretroviral therapy, the morbidity and mortality due to HIV have declined gradually. The aim of our study was to determine the cause of mortality among HIV-infected patients and the factors causing early death. Using medical records of 73 inpatients who are dead, data were collected and analyzed using SPSS version 19 (IBM SPSS Statistics). Chi-square test was performed to determine the factors contributing to early death. A P value &lt;.05 was considered significant. Among 73 deaths, 50 (68.5%) were AIDS related and 23 (31.5%) were non-AIDS related. The most common opportunistic infection causing death was Pneumocystis carinii pneumonia. Early deaths were strongly attributed to low CD4 counts at admission (&lt;100 cells), antiretroviral therapy-naive status, late presentation, and fewer admissions ( P value &lt;.05). Although AIDS-defining illness remains the main cause of death in HIV, there is significant number of deaths due to non-HIV-related causes. ","264":"Innovative approaches are needed to increase engagement in HIV treatment and prevention services, particularly in HIV hot spots. Here, we detail our design, training approach, and early implementation experiences of a community-based HIV intervention called \"health scouts.\" The intervention, utilizing a novel, theory-based approach, trained 10 community residents in an HIV hot spot fishing community to use motivational interviewing strategies and a mobile phone-based counseling application. During the first 3 months, 771 residents (median 82\/health scout, range 27-160) were counseled. A directly observed Motivational Interviewing Treatment Integrity scale-based evaluation found adequate performance (median score 20\/25, range 11-23). The health scout intervention was feasible to implement in a high HIV-prevalence fishing community, and its impact on HIV care outcomes will be evaluated in an ongoing cluster randomized trial. If found to be effective, it may be an important strategy for responding to HIV in high-burden settings.","265":"Data are lacking on factors that may impact conception-related decision-making among individuals living with HIV. This study's aim was to shed light on these considerations. Participants were invited to complete a survey on preconception considerations. A rank-ordered logit model was fit to estimate the relative importance of listed consideration factors; the interaction of HIV status and the factors was assessed. Fifty-nine participants living with HIV and 18 partners (11 HIV-negative participants and 7 living with HIV) were included. Risk of vertical and horizontal HIV transmission and the effect of antiretroviral therapy on the fetus were the top considerations. However, individuals living with HIV prioritized vertical transmission, whereas HIV-negative participants prioritized horizontal transmission. Other factors of importance were probability of conception, stress of trying to conceive, cost associated with fertility clinics, and stigma associated with certain conception methods. This study builds our understanding of the preconception considerations for people living with HIV.","266":null,"267":null,"268":"Bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is a rare complication of human immune deficiency virus (HIV) infection in the post-antiretroviral therapy (ART) era, and few cases of BA-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) have been described. We report the case of a 50-year-old man who presented with mass lesions involving the skin, subcutaneous tissues, muscle, and bone. The diagnosis of Bartonella quintana BA was confirmed by serum polymerase chain reaction. The patient's treatment course was complicated by both IRIS and Jarisch-Herxheimer reaction. The case had a favorable outcome with supportive care and continuation of ART and doxycycline.","269":null,"270":"Infection with multiple pathogens concurrently has become less common since the introduction of potent antiretroviral agent and effective prophylactic agents. We describe a patient with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis (PAP) admitted with pneumonia who was found to have AIDS and diagnosed with Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia, human herpesvirus type 1 (HHV-1), and a concomitant cytomegalovirus viremia. Polymerase chain reaction viral load was used for diagnosis of HHV-1 and follow-up. The patient was treated with trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and ganciclovir and had a resolution of pneumonia. Since patients with PAP who are diagnosed as having AIDS could be concomitantly infected with multiple pathogens, rapid accurate diagnosis and treatment may have a positive effect on outcome.","271":null,"272":"The duration of macrocytosis after stopping zidovudine (ZDV) is unknown. Among 104 HIV-infected patients treated with ZDV for more than 1 year, 84 patients had macrocytosis at ZDV discontinuation. The median mean corpuscular volume (MCV) was 114.6 fL (range 100-128 fL). Patients were divided into 2 groups: those who did (resolved macrocytosis, n = 36) and did not (persistent macrocytosis, n = 48) normalize MCV at 3 to 6 months after ZDV discontinuation. Alcohol use ( P = .02), smoking ( P = .03), and lower (but within normal range) folic acid levels ( P = .05) were related to the persistence of macrocytosis. A persistence of macrocytosis was observed in 57% at 3 to 6 months, 38% at 1 year and 37% at 2 years after ZDV therapy had stopped. Duration of ZDV therapy did not have an effect on the persistence of macrocytosis ( P = .73). The median time for the MCV to normalize after stopping ZDV was 12.5 months.","273":null,"274":"HIV infected patients have higher rates of HPV infection, worse disease progression, increase severity of disease, and are at higher risk for intraepithelial neoplasia and cancer than their HIV negative counterparts. We conducted a yearlong pilot project to evaluate the impact of text message HPV immunization reminder-recall in young HIV-1 positive patients in a large urban academic HIV clinic. We found that text message reminder-recall improved HPV immunization uptake in a young, primarily black and un- or under-insured HIV-1 infected patients. As communication by texting is characteristic of teens and young adults in the general population, text message reminder-recalls should be considered a viable option to improve vaccination rates among young HIV patients.","275":"The Caribbean region has the second highest HIV prevalence after Sub-Saharan Africa. Guyana's adult HIV prevalence is 1.9% among pregnant women, with women accounting for an estimated 58% of all persons living with HIV. However, there are few studies on ART adherence in the Caribbean, none from Guyana, and none focusing on adherence in pregnancy and the postpartum period. The objective of this study was to explore the perspectives of HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women and healthcare providers in Guyana about barriers and facilitators to ART adherence. Data was collected using semi-structured interviews with 24 HIV-infected pregnant and postpartum women and nine healthcare professionals at five clinics between February and April 2012. The Framework Method for analysing qualitative data identified facilitators and barriers related to five core themes: (i) Concern for wellbeing of children; (ii) ART-related factors; (iii) Disclosure; (iv) Socio-economic issues; and (v) Religious and cultural beliefs. Non-disclosure did not adversely affect adherence, contrary to other studies in the literature. Two broad categories emerged from the lived experiences of women in Guyana. The first is related to the act of actually taking their medication where their tenacity is displayed in efforts made to ensure ART is taken. The second relates to the significance of ART to them in terms of reduced risk of MTCT, and the possibility of better health for themselves to enable them to care for their children. However, issues related to poverty, food insecurity and side effects reduced adherence need to be adequately addressed.","276":"Prompt antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation after AIDS diagnosis, in the absence of certain opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis and cryptococcal meningitis, delays disease progression and death, but system barriers to inpatient ART initiation at large hospitals in the era of modern ART have been less studied. We reviewed hospitalizations for persons newly diagnosed with AIDS at Grady Memorial Hospital in Atlanta, Georgia in 2011 and 2012. Individual- and system-level variables were collected. Logistic regression models were used to estimate the odds ratios (ORs) for ART initiation prior to discharge. With Georgia Department of Health surveillance data, we estimated time to first clinic visit, ART initiation, and viral suppression. In the study population (n = 81), ART was initiated prior to discharge in 10 (12%) patients. Shorter hospital stay was significantly associated with lack of ART initiation at the time of HIV diagnosis (8 versus 24 days, OR: 1.14, 95% confidence interval: 1.04-1.25). Reducing barriers to ART initiation for newly diagnosed HIV-positive patients with short hospital stays may improve time to viral suppression.","277":"The administration of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in intubated critically ill patients may be challenging. Limited pharmacokinetic data exist characterizing the effects of crushed ART with subsequent enteral administration on antiretroviral drug concentrations or the clinical impact on HIV virologic suppression. We report a case of a 27-year-old HIV-positive male with presumed multidrug-resistant HIV and a diagnosis of lymphoma who required enteral ART administration after intensive care unit admission. Crushed twice-daily dolutegravir (separated from enteral nutrition by 2 hours) and rilpivirine (concurrently with a bolus feed) were administered via an orogastric tube. Therapeutic drug monitoring for both dolutegravir and rilpivirine demonstrated antiretroviral absorption via the enteral route (both values slightly below the therapeutic laboratory reference range) with continued virologic suppression.","278":"Intimate partner violence (IPV) is a severe form of abuse prevalent in urban and rural areas of India with its effects on mental and physical health of the person receiving it, leading to a poorer quality of life. A cross-sectional study was conducted among 99 women living with HIV, and information was collected using abuse assessment scale. The data were entered and analyzed using SPSS version 17.0. The IPV was reported by 19.2% of the respondents, of which psychological (14.1%) was most common followed by physical (4.1%) and sexual abuse (1.0%). The experience of IPV was significantly associated with socioeconomic status, number of children, marital status, and CD4 counts of the participants. The prevalence of IPV in our study was found to be less compared to previous studies, however, there were significant association among factors such as socioeconomic status, CD4 counts, and marital status of the participants. ","279":"We reviewed published national HIV care continua for men who have sex with men (MSM), people who inject drugs (PWID), and female sex workers (FSWs) to track progress toward the 90-90-90 target. We searched the Internet, PubMed, surveillance reports, United Nations Programme on HIV\/AIDS country reports, US President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief country\/regional operational plans, and conference abstracts for the continua and graded them on quality. We found 12 continua for MSM, 7 for PWID, and 5 for FSW from 12 countries. HIV diagnosis, antiretroviral therapy coverage, and viral suppression varied between (1) 5% and 85%, 2% and 73%, and 1% and 72%, respectively for MSM; (2) 54% and 96%, 14% and 80%, and 8% and 68%, respectively for PWID; and (3) 27% and 63%, 8% and 16%, and 2% and 14%, respectively for FSW. Two countries, using data from national cohorts, were high quality. There are limited key population continua in the public domain. Of the few available, none have achieved 90-90-90. Improved monitoring and evaluation of key population continua is necessary to achieve the 90-90-90 target.","280":"Registrational studies and observational cohorts clearly suggest sustained virologic response (SVR) rates in HIV-\/hepatitis C-coinfected patients are similar to monoinfected patients when utilizing interferon-free regimens, and this can be accomplished with agents that are well tolerated with minimal adverse events. These randomized trials that led to the approval of several of our new direct-acting antiviral agents, however, specifically excluded patients who had significant comorbidities and none to our knowledge accepted patients with a history of cancer. Therefore, the effect of treatment of active hepatitis C in such patients and the effect on preexisting neoplasia are relatively unknown. We prospectively followed a 62-year-old male coinfected with HIV\/hepatitis C who had a history of anal squamous cell carcinoma, prostate carcinoma, renal cell carcinoma all clinically cured and a myelodysplastic syndrome that was in remission. The patient achieved an SVR of hepatitis C with simeprevir\/sofosbuvir without ribavirin and died shortly thereafter of a fatal relapse of his previously clinically controlled myelodysplastic syndrome.","281":"","282":"We examined the relationship between depression (symptom type, diagnostic severity, and change over time) and adherence to HIV antiretroviral therapy (ART) with data from 3 longitudinal studies (N = 1021) of patients starting ART in Uganda. The Patient Health Questionnaire was used to assess depressive symptoms (total score; somatic and cognitive subscales) and categorize severity level. At baseline, 9% had major depression and 30% had minor depression; 82% were adherent (reported no missed ART doses in the past 7 days) at month 6 and 85% at month 12. Controlling for demographic and medical covariates, multivariate random-effects logistic regression models revealed that change in depression was not related to adherence; however, baseline total depression symptoms and cognitive symptoms in particular as well as major and minor depression were significant predictors of adherence. These findings highlight the need for early identification and aggressive treatment of depression to optimize ART adherence.","283":null,"284":"To identify factors to consider for developing and implementing a community-based exercise (CBE) program for people living with HIV (PLWH). We conducted a qualitative descriptive study using semi-structured interviews with PLWH, rehabilitation professionals, and recreation providers from Canada and the United Kingdom. We asked participants to describe their experience with exercise, facilitators, and barriers to accessing and participating in exercise, and factors to consider in developing a CBE program for PLWH. Interviews were analyzed using content analytical techniques. We developed a Framework of CBE in the Context of HIV that describes (1) exercise experiences of PLWH (nature of exercise, motivators for initiating or sustaining exercise, perceived benefits, and barriers and facilitators to exercise) and (2) 11 factors to consider in developing and implementing a CBE program for PLWH. Recommendations for the development and implementation of an accessible and feasible CBE program may enhance exercise participation among PLWH. ","285":null,"286":"Oral manifestations in HIV infections are numerous and some of these are acknowledged as being of great importance in the early diagnosis of the disease. Many HIV-associated oral infections occur early in HIV disease, not infrequently as the presenting sign or symptom. Thus, early detection of the associated oral opportunistic infections should, in many cases, result in earlier diagnosis of HIV infection. Cytology, a simple, painless, and inexpensive method, has become a preferred method and was used in our study for early diagnosis of certain lesions. To determine the effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy on incidence rate of opportunistic infections among HIV-positive adults in a teaching hospital in India, a prospective study was conducted and the required sample size was 40. Study participants were selected randomly from the outpatient department of an HIV clinic who were currently on for antiretroviral therapy (ART). Data on age, gender, form of contagion, antiretroviral therapy at the time of review, number of CD4 lymphocytes per milliliter, and viral load were collected. Oral cytologic investigation was carried out and then stained for histopathological examination. A total of 40 individuals were examined and the incidence of opportunistic infections was 66.7% in individuals with CD4 counts less than 200, 55.6% in individuals with CD4 counts of 200 to 499, and 40.0% in individuals with CD4 counts more than 500. The incidence of opportunistic infection was higher in individuals with low CD4 counts in spite of being on ART.","287":"Tenofovir (TDF)-based highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), as recommended by the World Health Organization guidelines for HIV-naive patients, has been limited in resource-constrained settings. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effectiveness of zidovudine-(ZDV) versus TDF-based HAART in the Yi minority region of Sichuan Province, China at a single HIV treatment center. The primary end point was the attainment of an HIV viral load &lt;50 copies\/mL. Secondary end points included change in CD4 level, adverse reactions, mortality, and sustained virologic suppression. Of the 361 total participants, recipients of TDF-based HAART were more likely to achieve viral load &lt;50 copies\/mL (60% versus 46%, odds ratio [OR] = 1.7, P = .016) as well as sustained virologic suppression (61% versus 28%, OR = 3.4, P = .001). Tenofovir (adjusted odds ratio [ORadj] = 1.71, P = .025) and female sex (ORadj = 1.93, P = .003) were identified as independent predictors of achieving HIV viral load &lt;50 copies\/mL in the multivariate logistic regression analysis. Among Chinese Yi minority HIV-infected participants, TDF-based HAART was superior to ZDV-based HAART for initial treatment of HIV infection, suggesting TDF-based HAART should be the regimen of choice in China. ","288":"Sexually transmitted diseases are a major public health problem both in developing and in developed countries, and especially with the co-synergy with HIV infection, there is an increasing need to have a proper understanding of the clinicodemographic patterns of sexually transmitted infections (STIs) for planning and implementing control strategies. Worldwide, there is an increased preponderance of viral STIs. Increasing incidence and altered clinical presentation of viral STIs in patients with HIV pose a diagnostic challenge; thereby, we studied the demographic profile of HIV-seropositive patients and compared clinical manifestations of viral STIs in HIV-seropositive patients to those in seronegative individuals. Twenty-seven HIV-seropositive patients with viral STI (herpes\/molluscum\/warts) and same number of age-, sex-, and STI-matched seronegative patients were studied for variability in clinical profile. There were significant differences in the demographic factors (education, income, and migration) and sexual practices (number of contacts and source of infection) in the 2 groups. Lesional symptoms, increased extent of lesions, and resistance to treatment were significantly more common in HIV-seropositive patients.","289":"The benign lymphoepithelial lesion is a rare and diagnostically challenging entity. Classically, these lesions present as early manifestation of HIV infection and are rarely seen in those on highly active antiretroviral therapy. We describe 2 rare cases of HIV-associated lympho-epithelial lesions of parotid gland in a 37-year-old female and a 47-year-old male receiving antiretroviral therapy. The lesions were characterized with respect to clinical features, as well as histopathology and radiology findings. Fine-needle aspiration cytology revealed benign squamous epithelium and lymphocytes. Sonographic evaluation of the parotid gland demonstrated intraparotid solid hypoechoic nodule. Computed tomography showed cystic and solid masses. These lesions were diagnosed as benign lymphoepithelial lesions in both cases. To our knowledge, this is the first report in the published literature describing newly occurring benign lymphoepithelial lesions in patients on antiretroviral therapy.","290":null,"291":"Chronic subdural hematomas (CSDHs) and its management comprise a majority work in a neurosurgical specialty. The effectiveness of surgery is beyond doubt and sometimes even lifesaving in severe cases. However, the straightforward surgery is sometimes complicated by the associated comorbidities of the patient. Comorbidities in the form of coagulopathies secondary to chronic liver diseases, drugs (warfarin, ecosprin, clopidogrel), thrombocytopenia secondary to systemic illness are always a challenge to deal with in patients with CSDH. The authors encountered a patient with thrombocytopenia secondary to systemic HIV infection who presented with CSDH. Her coagulation profile was severe enough to preclude surgery. She was managed conservatively with tranexamic acid and responded well. The authors present the challenges they faced in the course of successful management of this patient.","292":"Mobile HIV counseling and testing (HCT) has been effective in reaching men, women, and adolescents in South Africa. However, there is limited understanding of effective mobile HCT programs utilizing tools like technology and edutainment to increase HIV counseling and testing rates. The authors examine data from the Shout-It-Now (S-N) program that uses such tools in South Africa. The S-N program utilizes various forms of technology and ongoing telephonic counseling within a 6-step program of HIV testing and linkage-to-care support, and program data were analyzed over an 18-month period. Data were analyzed from women, men, and adolescent program participants. Summative statistics was conducted on participant registration, HIV risk assessment, and HIV testing profiles. HIV prevalence were estimated along with the related 95% confidence intervals using the Clopper-Pearson method. Over an 18-month period, there were 72 220 program participants with high representation of men, women, and adolescents and 40% of the participants being men at each site. There were 3343 participants who tested HIV positive, and a higher proportion of women tested positive. Integrating technology, quality assurance measures, and edutainment with mobile HCT has the potential to increase the number of those who test within communities. Research is needed to understand the effectiveness of this model in facilitating regular testing and linkage to care. ","293":"The use of alternative medicines, including herbs, is common among HIV-positive patients, even in those on antiretroviral treatment. Equisetum arvense, known as \"horsetail,\" is mainly used for its diuretic properties. There are limited data about the pharmacological properties of this compound and the potential drug-herb interactions. The authors report 2 cases in which a possible drug-herb interaction may have led to virological breakthrough in patients who were maintained on the same regimen for many years, including lamivudine (3TC)\/zidovudine (ZDV)\/efavirenz (EFV) and emtricitabine (FTC)\/tenofovir (TDF)\/EFV, respectively. Therefore, a drug-herb interaction may be expected when these agents are taken concurrently. Until additional data are available, the authors advise clinicians to avoid this combination when possible.","294":"Very-low-level viremia (VLLV) is a relatively new concept in the realm of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) care. Newer generation assays are now able to detect plasma HIV RNA Viral Load (VL) levels as low as 20 copies\/mL. The authors characterized patients with VLLV (VL between 20 and 50 copies\/mL) in order to identify possible risk factors associated with virologic failure and poor clinical outcomes. The authors reviewed 119 consecutive charts of patients with VLLV. Sociodemographic data were extracted and viral load and CD4 counts were trended over a 12 month period (February 2013-February 2014). Regression analysis was used to assess the role of different factors on virologic failure at 1 year. Of the study participants with evaluable data (n = 100), the median age was 53 years (interquartile range: 43-57.5), 67% were nonwhite, 34% were women, 58% were smokers, 47% were alcoholics, 58% had a history of intravenous drug use, and 40% were coinfected with hepatitis C virus. More than half of the participants had 3 or more comorbidities and their HIV pill burden was high (more than 2 pills daily). After 12 months, 65 participants achieved undetectable viral load levels, whereas 15 experienced virologic failure (2 consecutive viral loads &gt; 50 copies\/mL) and the remaining 20 had persistent VLLV. In the virologic failure group, there was a predominance of white males (66%) with a significant number of comorbidities and pill burden. Univariate logistic regression suggested that there was a difference between the failure versus nonfailure groups in terms of race, ethnicity, and alcohol use. Multivariate regression with virological failure as the outcome suggested a trend only in terms of participant's alcohol use. Most patients with initial VLLV (70%) achieved virologic suppression at 1 year with no antiretroviral therapy changes. Thus, VLLV does not necessarily predict virologic failure and should not prompt more frequent clinic visits or antiretroviral regimen changes. Further research is needed in order to determine the predictors of virologic failure in this subset of patients and the clinicians' attitude toward VLLV. ","295":null,"296":"Helminthic infection and HIV have been reported to coexist, particularly in sub-Saharan African patients living with HIV. Strongyloidiasis is one of the most common helminths, usually leading to cutaneous and gastrointestinal (GI) symptoms. In the immunocompromised host, this infection can lead to strongyloidiasis hyperinfection syndrome (SHS), not common in HIV-infected patients. Immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) can follow the initiation of antiretroviral therapy (ART), with a variety of presentations. The authors present here a 32-year-old HIV-infected female who was recently diagnosed with AIDS, started ART, and recovered from SHS. Her upper endoscopy revealed severe duodenitis but no causal agent per biopsy or stool examination. After receiving symptomatic therapy, she showed improvement, a course of events that fit the diagnosis of GI-related IRIS.","297":"As part of the HPTN 065 study in the Bronx, New York and Washington, the authors, we surveyed clinicians to assess for shifts in their practices and attitudes around HIV treatment and prevention. Antiretroviral therapy (ART)-prescribing clinicians at 39 HIV care sites were offered an anonymous Web-based survey at baseline (2010-2011) and at follow-up (2013). The 165 respondents at baseline and 141 respondents at follow-up had similar characteristics-almost 60% were female, median age was 47 years, two-thirds were physicians, and nearly 80% were HIV specialists. The percentage who reported recommending ART irrespective of CD4 count was higher at follow-up (15% versus 68%), as was the percentage who would initiate ART earlier for patients having unprotected sex with partners of unknown HIV status (64% versus 82%), and for those in HIV-discordant partnerships (75% versus 87%). In line with changing HIV treatment guidelines during 2010 to 2013, clinicians increasingly supported early ART for treatment and prevention.","298":"Pleural effusions typically present with nonspecific pulmonary complaints in the setting of either acute or chronic diseases. In the general population, these illnesses include congestive heart failure, infection, and malignancy. However, in people living with HIV\/AIDS (PLWHA), pleural effusions often result from opportunistic infections and AIDS-defining malignancies, such as Kaposi sarcoma and non-Hodgkin lymphoma. Since the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy, there has been a decline in the frequency of AIDS-defining opportunistic infections and AIDS-defining cancers and an increase in certain non-AIDS-defining malignancies including lung cancer. Throughout this period, longer life expectancy in PLWHA has contributed to an increased risk of those chronic diseases that can result in pleural effusions. This case describes an HIV-infected man who was an active cigarette smoker and alcoholic and who presented with a large pleural effusion of uncertain etiology. The authors review several important noncardiac risk factors associated with pleural effusions in PLWHA. The authors also emphasize the importance of obtaining a detailed medical history and the use of appropriate imaging and laboratory tests in order to identify an underlying cause and to provide optimal treatment.","299":"Stigma shapes all aspects of HIV prevention and treatment, yet there are limited data on how HIV-infected youth and their families are affected by stigma in sub-Saharan Africa. The authors conducted a qualitative study using focus group discussions among 39 HIV-infected adolescents receiving care at HIV clinics in western Kenya and 53 caregivers of HIV-infected children. Participants felt that while knowledge and access to treatment were increasing, many community members still held negative and inaccurate views about HIV, including associating it with immorality and believing in transmission by casual interactions. Stigma was closely related to a loss of social and economic support but also included internalized negative feelings about oneself. Participants identified treatment-related impacts of stigma, including nonadherence, nondisclosure of status to child or others, and increased mental health problems. Qualitative inquiry also provided insights into how to measure and reduce stigma among affected individuals and families.","300":null,"301":"In the United States, men who have sex with men (MSM) are known to disproportionately have HIV. The authors sought to describe the acceptability of providing at-home dried blood spot specimen collection kits for HIV testing among MSM. Between August 2010 and December 2010, the authors recruited Internet-using, HIV-negative or -unknown MSM to participate in a 12-month study of behavioral risks. Eligible participants were mailed an at-home HIV test. Of the 896 men who were sent a test kit, 735 (82%) returned the kit. Returning a test kit was significantly associated with race (P = .002), highest level of education (P = .012), and annual income (P = .026). The adjusted odds of black, non-Hispanic men returning a test kit were about half of the odds of white, non-Hispanic men returning a test kit (adjusted odds ratios: 0.49; 95% confidence intervals: 0.31-0.78). Men who have sex with men are willing to provide biological specimens as part of an Internet-based HIV prevention study. ","302":"The objective of this report was to assess Georgia's progress toward Joint United Nations Programme on HIV\/AIDS 90-90-90 targets over the period between 2011 and 2015. The number of HIV-positive persons was estimated using Spectrum software. Number of persons diagnosed, on antiretroviral therapy (ART) and virally suppressed were quantified using data from the national AIDS health information system. By the end of 2015, out of the estimated 7100 persons living with HIV, 62% were diagnosed, 38% were on ART, and 32% were virally suppressed. There were improvements in each stage of cascade from 2011 to 2015: the proportion of diagnosed persons increased from 46% to 61%, ART coverage among diagnosed persons increased from 46% to 62%, and the proportion of virally suppressed patients among those on ART increased from 74% to 85%. Despite the progress, additional efforts are needed to reach the 90-90-90 targets. Reducing the number of people living with undiagnosed HIV will be critical for achieving goals.","303":"The US treatment guidelines recommend Pneumocystis jiroveci pneumonia (PCP) prophylaxis for all HIV-infected persons with a CD4 count &lt;200 cells\/mm3 (ie, eligible for PCP prophylaxis). However, some studies suggest PCP prophylaxis may be unnecessary in virally suppressed patients. Using national data of HIV-infected adults receiving medical care in the United States during 2009 to 2012, the authors assessed the weighted percentage of eligible patients who were prescribed PCP prophylaxis and the independent association between PCP prophylaxis prescription and viral suppression. Overall, 81% of eligible patients were prescribed PCP prophylaxis. Virally suppressed eligible patients were less likely to be prescribed PCP prophylaxis (prevalence ratio: 0.84; 95% confidence interval: 0.80-0.89). Although guidelines recommend PCP prophylaxis for all eligible patients, some HIV care providers might not prescribe PCP prophylaxis to virally suppressed patients. Additional data on the risk for PCP among virally suppressed patients are needed to clarify this controversy.","304":"HIV has disproportionately affected economically vulnerable populations. HIV medical care, including antiretroviral therapy, successfully restores physical health but can be insufficient to achieve social and economic health. It may therefore be necessary to offer innovative economic support programs such as providing business training and microcredit tailored to people living with HIV\/AIDS. However, microfinance institutions have shown reluctance to reach out to HIV-infected individuals, resulting in nongovernment and HIV care organizations providing these services. The authors investigate the baseline characteristics of a sample of medically stable clients in HIV care who are eligible for microcredit loans and evaluate their business and financial needs; the authors also analyze their repayment pattern and how their socioeconomic status changes after receipt of the program. The authors find that there is a significant unmet need for business capital for the sample under investigation, pointing toward the potentially beneficial role of providing microfinance and business training for clients in HIV care. HIV clients participating in the loans show high rates of repayment, and significant increases in (disposable) income, as well as profits and savings. The authors therefore encourage other HIV care providers to consider providing their clients with such loans.","305":"Racial and ethnic disparities in viral load suppression (VLS) have been well documented among people living with HIV (PLWH). The authors hypothesized that a contemporary analytic technique could reveal factors underlying these disparities and provide more explanatory power than broad stereotypes. Classification and regression tree analysis was used to detect factors associated with VLS among 11 419 adult PLWH receiving treatment from 186 New York State HIV clinics in 2013. A total of 8885 (77.8%) patients were virally suppressed. The algorithm identified 8 mutually exclusive subgroups characterized by age, housing stability, drug use, and insurance status but neither race nor ethnicity. Our findings suggest that racial and ethnic disparities in VLS exist but likely reflect underlying social and behavioral determinants of health.","306":"Social support has been noted to improve health outcomes for individuals with HIV. Understanding how neighborhoods contribute to feelings of social support is beneficial to create environments where populations with HIV can be supported. This study assessed the relationship between neighborhood perceptions and social support with HIV management. A total of 201 individuals were recruited; individuals with HIV, 18 years or older, who were eligible to participate in the 2-hour interview. Psychiatric diagnostic interviews were conducted alongside assessments of social support and neighborhood perceptions; biomedical markers were abstracted from medical records. Correlations and linear regression analyses were performed to assess relationships between social support and neighborhood perceptions with HIV management biomarkers. The majority of the sample was male (68.8%) and African American (72.3%), with a mean age of 43.1 years. Overall, 78% were receiving combination antiretroviral therapy (cART) prescriptions, with 69% being virally suppressed. Fear of neighborhood activities was independently associated with receiving current cART. Reports of social support and neighborhood perceptions were highly correlated. Findings suggest that supportive home environments likely would improve perceptions of social support.","307":"Since 2006, numerous testing initiatives have been launched across the United States to increase the number of individuals who know their HIV status. These initiatives are often venue based and reported in a variety of settings. However, the effectiveness of these initiatives has not been evaluated to determine if patients were identified earlier in the course of disease or would not have been otherwise tested. In 2010, a publicly funded teaching hospital implemented an electronic medical record prompt to improve the rate of routine HIV screening and diagnosis, focusing on primary care office visits. Both sex and CD4 count were found to be significantly related to being newly diagnosed after the intervention. Routine testing in primary care is an effective strategy to diagnose patients earlier in disease progression, particularly men who might otherwise not be tested and thus would remain undiagnosed until developing symptoms from advanced disease.","308":"Preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for HIV has the potential to reduce HIV incidence in highly affected areas. The Southeastern United States is disproportionately impacted by HIV, and 3 counties in South Florida have the highest incidence of new HIV infections in the United States. This study explored the feasibility, acceptability, and uptake of PrEP in South Florida. Focus groups consisting of providers, administrators, and case managers at HIV-servicing community health centers and federally qualified health centers in South Florida reported broad support but low implementation of PrEP. Generally, participants indicated that the centers were appropriate locations for implementation. However, practical concerns and perceived limitations due to financial, insurance, and immigration status of those who would potentially benefit from the intervention were widely reported. Addressing provider concerns appears necessary for successful expansion of PrEP implementation in highly impacted areas such as South Florida.","309":"It has been previously shown that patients may present for multiple health issues in the years preceding their initial HIV diagnosis. This retrospective cohort study analyzed the data of patients with a new HIV diagnosis, at Ochsner Health System between January 1, 2011, and December 31, 2012. The primary end point was missed opportunities, the number of healthcare visits these patients made in the 2 years prior to being diagnosed with HIV. The 125 patients in the study cohort had 649 healthcare visits during which an HIV test was not performed. These missed opportunities are the key to capturing the undiagnosed and unaware HIV-positive individual. Primary care is an ideal setting to conduct HIV testing for those who have access to regular health care. However, nontraditional providers should also be encouraged to conduct HIV testing regardless of their ability to provide treatment because evidence shows that knowledge of the diagnosis may change behavior.","310":null,"311":"","312":null,"313":"Without antiretroviral therapy (ART), approximately one-half of HIV-infected infants will die by two years. In 2010, the World Health Organization (WHO) recommended that all HIV-infected infants &lt; 24 months be initiated on ART regardless of their clinical\/immunologic status. However, there remains little published data detailing cohorts of infants on ART in Sub-Saharan Africa. This study describes baseline characteristics and 12 month outcomes of a cohort of HIV-infected children &lt; 24 months of age at pediatric HIV centers in Mwanza and Mbeya, Tanzania. Retrospective chart review. children &lt; 24 months of age, initiated on ART at Baylor Children s Foundation Tanzania clinics, between March-December 2011. Baseline: Ninety-three children were initiated on ART at a median age of 13.4 months. Sixty-seven percent had severe immunosuppression and 31.5% had severe malnutrition. Seventy-three patients were still in care at 12 month follow-up, there were four (4.3%) deaths, five (5.4%) patients transferred, and 11 (11.8%) loss to follow-up. Average CD4% was 32.7 (p &lt; 0.001). Ninety percent of patients were WHO treatment stage I (p &lt; 0.001). Eighty-six percent had normal nutritional status (p &lt; 0.001). Our cohort of HIV infected children &lt; 24 months initiated on ART did well clinically at 12 month outcomes despite being severely immunocompromised and malnourished at baseline. Nevirapine based regimens had good 12 month clinical outcomes, regardless of maternal exposure. Loss to follow-up rate was high for our cohort, demonstrating the need to develop strong mechanisms to counteract this.

In contrast to the general population where smoking prevalence in men exceeds that in women, large surveys have shown similar smoking rates among male and female PLWH. There are important behavioral and biological differences between male and female smokers, but little is known about the relationships between tobacco use and gender in PLWH. Herein, the authors present a detailed examination of gender differences in smokers living with HIV (N = 267; 54% male, 46% female) recruited in 2 tobacco treatment trials. The authors found higher rates of heavy smoking and other substance use in men. Women were more likely to have used pharmacotherapy during quit attempts. Asthma rates were markedly higher in female smokers. There were no significant differences in a range of psychobehavioral domains or in cessation rates between male and female smokers living with HIV.","318":null,"319":null,"320":"Physical function limitations have been associated with poor health outcomes, which have a negative impact on quality of life of older individuals. This study examined the association between depression, viral load, and acculturation with physical function among Latino men living with HIV. A secondary data analysis was performed using a cross-sectional data of 146 Latino immigrant men living with HIV in New York City and Washington, DC. Physical function was measured using the Short-Form Health Survey (SF-12). Uncontrolled HIV infection and depression were associated with worse physical function, thus implying the importance of adequate health care to address these conditions. Preserving physical function should start during middle adulthood, particularly among people living with HIV because of their greater risk of developing age-related challenges such as depression, diabetes, cardiovascular diseases among others. This study informs future interventions to preserve physical function and achieve the goal of successful aging.","321":"The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the U.S. Preventive Services Task Force issued HIV testing recommendations, encouraging physicians to routinely test all adult patients for HIV. Studies have found that not all physicians are abiding by these guidelines, but that physician recommendations for HIV testing could encourage patients to get tested. Our study sought to determine physician preferences for a physician-targeted campaign to encourage them to offer HIV tests to their patients. The study took place across 19 publicly-funded community health centers. A web-based survey was sent to primary care physicians, assessing their preferences for physician-targeted HIV testing campaign elements. Response frequencies were calculated for each element. 175 physicians participated. Campaign elements were divided into \"HIV Testing Information,\" \"Communication Tools,\" and \"Promotion Strategies.\" Physicians selected receiving a copy of the latest HIV testing recommendations, having patients ask for the HIV test, and receiving an EMR alert for HIV testing as their top elements for each category, respectively. An effective physician HIV testing campaign should include information about HIV testing recommendations, proof of patient receptiveness to HIV testing, and strategies to prompt HIV testing conversations. A multi-faceted approach combining patient and physician prompts to discuss HIV testing might be the most effective method to improve HIV testing rates.","322":"In many resource-poor settings such as Peru, children affected by HIV have a high prevalence of neurodevelopmental delays (NDDs) and remain excluded from adequate treatment. Community health workers (CHWs) administered NDD screening instruments to assess child development and associated caregiver and household factors in 14 HIV-affected parent-child dyads. Focus group discussion with caregivers was conducted to explore their needs and behaviors around early child stimulation and to assess their perceptions of the screening experience. Over 70% of the children had abnormal classification in at least 1 (out of 5) developmental domains according to Ages and States Questionnaire-provided cutoff scores. Caregiver depression and stress were associated with abnormal development as were some parenting behavior factors. Knowledge about child development was low. Caregivers felt testing and discussing results with a CHW were very insightful. Reported caregiver behavior differed between caregivers with HIV-infected children and those with uninfected children. Taken together, these exploratory quantitative data suggest that parenting behaviors associated with low child development scores may be modifiable and that community-based testing is well received and informative to these HIV-infected caregivers. ","323":"People living with HIV\/AIDS (PLWHA) are surviving longer, with an increased risk of cancer. Cancer screening strategies in PLWHA are lacking. We describe the case of a woman with a history of AIDS, who had a nondetectable viral load on treatment. She is an activist, promoting HIV care, but had not undergone routine screening for breast, cervical, or colonic neoplasia. She presented with a left groin mass, which on biopsy proved to be a p16 immuno-histochemical positive squamous cell carcinoma. Anal and cervicovaginal examinations did not show invasive cancer, although high-resolution anoscopy identified high-grade anal dysplasia. A mammogram followed by magnetic resonance imaging showed invasive ductal carcinoma. Her breast cancer was treated with lumpectomy, adjuvant brachytherapy and chemotherapy. The left groin tumor was treated with chemo-radiation. Herein, we also review medical literature concerning anal, cervical, breast, colorectal, and lung cancer screening for PLWHA, which is important for our aging population of PLWHA.","324":"","325":"We carried out a retrospective, multicenter study of a cohort of 298 asymptomatic HIV-infected patients who switched from a regimen based on 2 nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors + protease inhibitor (PI)\/nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor or ritonavir-boosted PI monotherapy to emtricitabine\/rilpivirine\/tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (FTC\/RPV\/TDF) to analyze lipid changes. At 24 weeks, 284 (95.3%) patients were still taking the same regimen, maintaining similar CD4 counts as at baseline (651 versus 672 cells\/mm(3), P = .08), and 98.9% of them with an undetectable viral load. Eight of the other 14 patients were lost to follow up and 6 (2.0%) ceased the new regimen: 3 due to adverse effects, 2 due to virologic failure, and 1 due to abandonment. The mean levels of fasting total cholesterol (TC), low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, high-density lipoprotein cholesterol (HDL-C), and triglycerides fell at 12 and 24 weeks, with no changes detected in the TC to HDL-C ratio.","326":"We implemented triage nurse rapid HIV and hepatitis C virus (HCV) screening, in parallel with physician diagnostic testing, in our urban emergency department (ED). A 2-month cross-sectional survey was performed to determine the proportion of patients who correctly reported being tested for HIV and HCV. A total of 492 patients were surveyed. Fifty-one (70%) of the 73 patients who reported being HIV tested and 372 (89%) of the 419 patients who reported not being HIV tested were correct. Thirty (60%) of the 50 patients who reported being HCV tested and 416 (94%) of the 442 patients who reported not being HCV tested were correct. Although most ED patients correctly reported whether testing was performed, there were many who did not. Although ED screening programs for HIV and HCV serve as an important venue for screening, strategies to improve communication require attention. ","327":"Clostridium difficile is a gram-positive bacterium that is recognized as a causative organism of pseudomembranous enterocolitis. This infection has become a major public health challenge and is a source of considerable morbidity and mortality in those infected. We present a 62-year-old African American female with a long history of HIV infection, who presented with abdominal pain and continuous diarrhea due to pseudomembranous colitis. After failing multiple episodes of conventional therapy, it was decided to treat her with fecal microbiota transplantation. Fecal microbiota transplantation was given on 3 separate occasions from a biological-related donor without success. It was only after a fourth transplant was done with a nonrelated donor that the patient resolved her diarrhea within 48 hours. We suggest that fecal samples from different donors have different abilities to cure Clostridium difficile colitis in at least this immunosuppressed patient. ","328":": Achieving the 90-90-90 targets by 2020 requires increased focus, resources, and efficiency to provide earlier access to antiretroviral therapy (ART). We used 2009 to 2013 National AIDS Spending Assessment data to assess HIV care and treatment spending in 38 high-burden, low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). In 2013, 23 of the 38 high-burden countries spent less than 50% of total HIV spending on care and treatment. HIV spending on ART per people living with HIV (PLHIV; adjusted) averaged US$299 (US$32-US$2463). During 2009 to 2013, a 10% increase in average spending on care and treatment per PLHIV was associated with an increase in ART coverage of 2.4% and a decrease in estimated AIDS-related death rate of 2.4 per 1000 PLHIV. HIV spending in high-burden LMICs does not consistently reflect the new science around the preventative and clinical benefits of earlier HIV diagnosis and ART initiation. ","329":"To determine the socioeconomic impacts among HIV-infected persons in Sudan and examine whether there are significant variations in coping strategies between infected men and women, a primary survey was conducted among infected persons (n = 555). Discriminant function was used to analyze the data. We found significant variation in the coping strategies (&lt;.001). HIV\/AIDS impacts were more critical for women. Infected people have 3 alternatives in coping with the changes in their income and expenditure, that is, borrow, utilize savings, or sell assets. Policy makers should consider economic information in planning health care to mitigate the impacts and remove the gender gap.","330":"We sought to characterize recent cases of toxic epidermal necrolysis (TEN) in HIV-infected patients at San Francisco General Hospital (SFGH), a large HIV referral center. This was a retrospective analysis of HIV-infected patients diagnosed with TEN from January 2001 to May 2014 at SFGH. Ten cases of TEN were identified, 50% of which occurred in HIV-infected individuals. Among the HIV-associated cases, causative agents were trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX; n = 2), atovaquone, clindamycin, and fluconazole. No antiretroviral agents were implicated. Although limited by small sample size, our experience is reflective of the well-recognized increased incidence of TEN in HIV-positive patients and suggests that antimicrobial agents, particularly TMP-SMX, are the most common causative agents in this population. As 3 of the 5 HIV-associated TEN cases were caused by potentially inappropriate or unnecessary use of antibiotics, our experience highlights the importance of judicious use of systemic medications in populations susceptible to severe adverse drug reactions. ","331":"This study was conducted on patients with thalassemia and HIV-infected patients to determine the frequency of diarrheagenic Escherichia coli in Kerman, Iran. We analyzed 68 and 49 E coli isolates isolated from healthy fecal samples of patients with thalassemia and HIV-infected patients, respectively. The E coli isolates were studied using a multiplex polymerase chain reaction to identify the enterotoxigenic E coli (ETEC), enterohemorrhagic E coli (EHEC), and enteropathogenic E coli (EPEC) groups. Statistical analysis was carried out to determine the correlation of diarrheagenic E coli between HIV-infected patients and patients with thalassemia using Stata 11.2 software. The frequency of having at least 1 diarrheagenic E coli was more common in patients with thalassemia (67.64%) than in HIV-infected patients (57.14%; P = .25), including ETEC (67.64% versus 57.14%), EHEC (33.82% versus 26.53%), and EPEC (19.11% versus 16.32%). The results of this study indicate that ETEC, EHEC, and EPEC pathotypes are widespread among diarrheagenic E coli isolates in patients with thalassemia and HIV-infected patients.","332":"HIV testing and linkage to care are critical first steps along the care continuum. Targeted efforts are needed in the South to achieve the goals of the National HIV\/AIDS Strategy, and qualitative examination of testing and linkage to care from the perspective of professionals in the field can provide nuanced insight into the strengths and limitations of a care system to inform improvement efforts. These issues are explored in North Carolina (NC), with potential applicability to other Southern states. Twenty-one interviews were conducted with professionals in the HIV prevention and care systems in NC. Interviews were analyzed for emergent themes. Individuals' access barriers, aspects of clinics and clinical care, challenges for community-based organizations, stigma, and the role of the NC Department of Health and Human Services were identified as themes affecting testing and linkage. These findings can inform efforts to address HIV testing and linkage to care in NC. This approach may provide beneficial insight for other systems of care.

To elucidate the unique factors that impact consistent HIV care engagement, a qualitative case study was conducted in North Carolina to examine the barriers and facilitators to retain and reengage HIV clients in care. HIV professionals (n = 21) from a variety of health care settings across the state participated in interviews that were transcribed and analyzed for emergent themes. Respondents described barriers to care at all levels within the HIV prevention and care system including intrapersonal, interpersonal, institutional, community, and public policy.

The authors measured the prevalence of Chlamydia trachomatis (CT), Neisseria gonorrhea (NG), and syphilis, and their correlates among 319 HIV-positive individuals in Kathmandu, Nepal. The authors tested blood samples for syphilis and urine samples for CT and NG. Overall, 17 (5.3%) participants had at least 1 STI (CT: 1.3%, NG: 2.8%, and syphilis: 1.2%). Of 226 participants who had sex in past 6 months, 51.3% did not always use condoms. Older (aged 35-60 years) participants were more likely (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 3.83; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.19-12.33; P = .024) and those who were currently married (AOR = 0.30; 95% CI = 0.09-0.97; P = .046) or on antiretroviral therapy (AOR = 0.21; 95% CI = 0.06-0.71; P = .012) were less likely to have at least 1 STI. Our results suggest the need to strengthen the efforts to screen and treat STIs and to promote safer sexual practices among Nepalese HIV-positive individuals.","338":"An estimated 50% of people living with HIV (PLHIV) globally are unaware of their status. Among those who know their HIV status, many do not receive antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a timely manner, fail to remain engaged in care, or do not achieve sustained viral suppression. Barriers across the HIV care continuum prevent PLHIV from achieving the therapeutic and preventive effects of ART. A systematic literature search was conducted, and 6132 articles, including randomized controlled trials, observational studies with or without comparators, cross-sectional studies, and descriptive documents, met the inclusion criteria. Of these, 1047 articles were used to generate 36 recommendations to optimize the HIV care continuum for adults and adolescents. Recommendations are provided for interventions to optimize the HIV care environment; increase HIV testing and linkage to care, treatment coverage, retention in care, and viral suppression; and monitor the HIV care continuum.

The authors conducted a cross-sectional study in Argentina to describe associations between HIV, HCV, and cholesterol. Of the 202 participants, 21 were HIV infected, 15 were HCV infected, 46 were HIV\/HCV coinfected, and 120 were HIV\/HCV uninfected. HIV\/HCV-uninfected participants had the highest total cholesterol (TC) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) levels. Multivariate modeling revealed that HIV\/HCV-coinfected patients had the lowest TC levels (-28.7 mg\/dL, P &lt; .001) compared to the HIV\/HCV-uninfected reference group. Hepatitis C virus and HIV\/HCV coinfection were associated with lower LDL levels (-21.4 mg\/dL, P = .001 and -20.3 mg\/dL, P &lt; .0001, respectively). HIV and HIV\/HCV coinfection, but not HCV alone, were associated with lower high-density lipoprotein levels (-9.1 mg\/dL, P = .0008 and -6.8 mg\/dL, P = .0006, respectively).

In a cross-sectional design,130 HIV-positive patients in HIV clinic of Tehran University were studied. Patients screened for LTBI with QFT and TST simultaneously. Concordance between 2 tests results and variables associated with tests discordance were assessed. Positive results found in 24.6% for TST and 7.7% for QFT. Overall agreement between them was 73.85% (Kappa = 0.083). History of imprisonment was associated with more positive TST (P = 0.014) and QFT (P = 0.01). Patients with intravenous drug use (IDU) history had significant discordant results (0.018). The authors recommend QFT for all negative cases of TST in HIV-positive patients especially who had history of IDU. ","345":"Combination antiretroviral therapy has been shown to reduce HIV transmission and incident infections. In recent years, Malawi has significantly increased the number of individuals on combination antiretroviral drugs through more inclusive treatment policies. Using a retrospective observational cohort design, records with HIV test results were reviewed for pregnant women attending a referral hospital in Malawi over a 5-year period, with viral load measurements recorded. HIV prevalence over time was determined, and results correlated with population viral load. A total of 11 052 women were included in this analysis, with 440 (4.1%) HIV infections identified. HIV prevalence rates in pregnant women in Malawi halved from 6.4% to 3.0% over 5 years. Mean viral loads of adult patients decreased from 120 000 copies\/mL to less than 20 000 copies\/mL. Results suggest that community viral load has an effect on HIV incidence rates in the population, which in turn correlates with reduced HIV prevalence rates in pregnant women. ","346":"Evidence-based guidelines have long recommended that HIV care providers deliver HIV transmission risk-reduction (RR) services, but recent data are needed to assess their adoption. The authors surveyed a probability sample of 1234 US HIV care providers on delivery of 9 sexual behavior- and 7 substance use-related HIV transmission RR services and created an indicator of \"adequate\" delivery of services in each area, defined as performing approximately 70% or more of applicable services. Providers were most likely to encourage patients to disclose HIV status to all partners since HIV diagnosis (81%) and least likely to ask about disclosure to new sex and drug injection partners at follow-up visits (both 41%). Adequate delivery of sexual behavior- and substance use-related RR services was low (37% and 43%, respectively). The majority of US HIV care providers may need additional support to improve delivery of comprehensive HIV transmission RR services.

This study examined reproductive intentions, practices, and attitudes among men in HIV-infected couples, including attitudes regarding the perceived risk of vertical and horizontal transmission, safer conception, and preconception planning. Men ( n = 12) in HIV-infected couples were interviewed regarding reproductive intentions, attitudes, and knowledge and qualitative assessments were coded for dominant themes. Themes primarily addressed concerns about the health of the baby, men's involvement in pregnancy, safer conception, concerns about HIV transmission and antiretroviral therapy, and HIV infection. Men lacked information on safer conception and newer HIV prevention strategies, such as pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP). Gaps in knowledge regarding preconception practices among men in HIV-infected couples were identified. Results highlight men's desire for involvement in preconception planning, and opportunities for providers to facilitate this practice and to increase patient education and the use of PrEP are discussed. ","348":"Although highly active antiretroviral therapy has improved the quality of life among HIV-infected people in India, the emergence of drug resistance along with the limited access and affordability to routine monitoring continues to be a challenge worldwide. The frequency and patterns of HIV-1 drug-resistance mutations among the first-line failing HIV-infected patients attending a hospital in Salem, Tamil Nadu, India, were genotypically analyzed using the online Stanford HIV Database. Of the study patients followed up for 6 months, 23 patients failed first-line therapy and the mutation of I135R\/T\/V\/X, L178 I\/M, M184V\/I, D67N, K70R, and K103N was most common. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that most of these patients belonged to HIV subtype C. The study documents the frequency of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor and nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor mutations that are prevalent in the first-line failing HIV-infected patients of South Indian region and adds up to the data for developing future algorithms to study the drug-resistance mutations of HIV subtype C. Thus, the results of the study call for the need for rational approach for selecting and for frequent viral monitoring to be performed to detect failure, followed by genotyping.

The goal of this study was to assess the implementation of these services in Cambodia. This prospective study was conducted in Bantey Meanchey at 2 sites. Staff reviewed daily clinic and laboratory registration logs to gather data on PMTCT service access among antenatal women. A total of 12 140 pregnant women received antenatal care. Only 4034 (33.2%) received pre-HIV test counseling. Of which 3407 (84.5%) received an HIV test. Eighteen (94.7%) of 19 women testing HIV-seropositive received triple-combination antiretroviral (ARV) medication. Fifteen HIV-exposed infants were delivered during the study. One infant tested HIV positive and is on ARV medication. Acceptance for HIV testing was high among women who received pretest counseling. An increase in the number of counselors may improve the rates of HIV testing. Follow-up mechanisms targeting mother-baby pairs should focus on increasing timely service uptake in the public sector.

The authors performed a 2-year retrospective study of postpartum HIV-infected patients at Komfo Anokye Teaching Hospital in Kumasi, Ghana. The outcome was classified as optimal follow-up, suboptimal follow-up, and loss to follow-up (LTFU). Univariate and multivariate analyses were used to identify factors associated with optimal retention. Follow-up was optimal in 66%, suboptimal in 16%, and LTFU in 18% of patients. The rate of LTFU was 22% among women diagnosed at pregnancy and 13% among those with known HIV diagnosis (P = .078). Adherence counseling (odds ratio [OR] 5.0, confidence interval [CI] 1.6-15.7; P = .006) and family planning (FP; OR 2.3, CI 1.0-5.3; P = .041) were predictive of optimal follow-up.

Unfortunately, HIV sero-positive inmates report perceived discrimination and missed antiretroviral doses. Correctional facility nursing competency in HIV management may mitigate these concerns. Using validated knowledge instruments, the authors measured baseline HIV knowledge in correctional facility nurses from 3 correctional facilities in Alberta, Canada, and quantified changes after a targeted educational workshop. Basic HIV knowledge increased significantly, whereas perceived need for further HIV education significantly decreased postintervention. This study demonstrates that correctional facility nurses may not receive ideal HIV education during employment and that targeted HIV workshops can significantly increase knowledge and confidence when caring for affected individuals.","352":null,"353":"A randomized controlled trial is being conducted in the United States to test the efficacy of a personalized interactive mobile health intervention (iSTEP) designed to increase physical activity (PA) and improve neurocognitive functioning among HIV-positive persons.

HIV-related knowledge may affect understanding and utilization of HIV medical information, hence limited health literacy is a known barrier to treatment adherence. A cross-sectional study included 494 HIV-infected individuals from the Bissau HIV Cohort in Guinea-Bissau. They completed a questionnaire designed for assessment of adherence and HIV-related knowledge. A majority were female, 41% were illiterate, 25% did not take the medicine during the last 4 days, and 23% skipped their medicine during weekends. The most frequent reasons for not taking medicine were simply forgetting, side effects, lack of food, and being too ill to attend the clinic. Nonadherent patients had a lower level of HIV-related knowledge. Main barriers for nonadherence were side effects, food insecurity, and simply forgetting. Lack of HIV-related knowledge about ART and HIV may be a barrier to nonadherence.

The authors conducted in-depth interviews with 30 clinicians--primary care and HIV specialists--in the New York City (NYC) region to explore issues related to PrEP rollout, including who should provide it and in what settings. A diverse group favored offering PrEP in non-HIV specialty settings in order to reach high-risk HIV-negative individuals. Yet, for each clinical skill or ancillary service deemed important for providing PrEP--knowledge of the medications, ability to assess and counsel around sexual risk behavior, and ability to provide support for retention and medication adherence--participants were divided in whether they thought primary care providers\/practices could achieve it. Five participants strongly favored providing PrEP in HIV care practices. Although there may be multiple \"homes\" for PrEP, implementation research is needed to identify the most effective delivery approaches.

We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to assess the effect of early initiation of ART (within 2-4 weeks of TB treatment) on several treatment outcomes among TB\/HIV-coinfected patients. A systematic search of clinical trials was performed in PubMed, Embase, Google Scholar, Science Direct, Medscape, and the Cochrane library. Clinical trials which were published in any language before the last date of search (March 31, 2015) were included. The qualities of the studies were assessed using criteria from the Cochrane Library. Heterogeneity test was conducted to assess the variations among study outcomes. For each study outcome, the risk ratio (RR) with 95% confidence interval (CI) was calculated as a measure of intervention effect. The Mantel-Haenszel method was used to estimate the RR using a fixed-effects model. A total of 2272 study participants from 6 trials were included in the meta-analysis. Early ART initiation during TB treatment was associated with reduced all-cause mortality (RR = 0.78; 95% CI = 0.63-0.98) and increased rate of TB-associated immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (TB-IRIS; RR = 2.19; 95% CI = 1.77- 2.70) and death related to TB-IRIS (RR = 6.94; 95% CI = 1.26-38.22). However, the time of ART initiation has no association with TB cure rate (RR = 0.99; 95% CI = 0.81-1.07), rate of drug toxicity (RR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.93-1.08), death associated with drug toxicity (RR = 0.40; 95% CI = 0.14- 1.16), rate of low viral load (less than 400 copies\/mL; RR = 1.00; 95% CI = 0.96-1.04), and rate of new AIDS-defining illness (RR = 0.84; 95% CI = 0.60-1.18). Immunological response in early ART arms of study participant in different trials showed a greater or equal response compared with late ART arms. This systematic review presents conclusive evidence on the reduction of all-cause mortality as a result of early initiation of ART. However, this study also confirms the high rate of TB-IRIS and death associated with it. Operational and implementation research are required to maintain the benefit of early ART initiation and proper management of TB-IRIS.

A retrospective chart review of adult patients treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) and who were hospitalized from September 2012 to February 2013. A CSDDI was defined as requiring an alternative therapy, dose adjustment, or schedule modification. Findings were compared to a prior study. A total of 185 admissions were included and 76 CSDDIs were identified, 19 (25%) occurred after ART approval. The percentages of CSDDIs that occurred after ART approval and were intervened upon before and after ARVSP expansion were 43% and 95%, respectively (P&lt;.001).

A total of 9782 unique HIV testing events performed through a national program of CBVCT in Antigua and Barbuda (2009-2012) were analyzed. The authors describe testers' demographic characteristics and assess demographic (education, housing, marital status, nationality, and age) and sexual exposure (partner gender, transactional sex, and multiple partners) factors associated with testing HIV-positivity and with condom use. Older men and men having sex with women and women with higher education, of Antiguan nationality, and having sex with men were less likely to test positive for HIV. Younger, educated, and unmarried men and women with multiple partners were more likely to report using condoms. The CBVCT model can be successfully implemented in Eastern Caribbean. Demographic differences persist in HIV testing, risk behavior, and infection among vulnerable populations and should be considered in HIV prevention intervention design.

In this cross-sectional study, 356 people living with HIV (PLHIV) were interviewed to assess their QOL using WHOQOL-HIV BREF questionnaire. The association between QOL with sociodemographic, clinical and cohabitation status of the participants was tested using ANOVA and Student t-test, and p value &lt; .05 was considered statistically significant. Physical domain of QOL showed maximum score of 16.4, while a minimum score of 12.2 was seen in social relationship domain. Participants with higher socioeconomic status (SES) and self-motivated to take ART had shown better scores across all the domains of QOL ( p &lt; .05).

In this study, to estimate the annual rate of direct liver fibrosis progression, we used analyses of paired biopsy samples from HIV\/HCV-coinfected patients without prior treatment of hepatitis and assessed the possible association of fibrosis progression with certain clinical variables. We evaluated 30 HIV\/HCV-coinfected patients, with no history of prior treatment of hepatitis C, who underwent paired liver biopsies. All patients were under antiretroviral therapy at first and second biopsies. The average annual progression rate was 0.13 fibrosis unit\/year, with 36.7% of patients defined as progressors. Liver fibrosis progression was associated with alanine aminotransferase (ALT; P &lt; .001) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST; P &lt; .0340) levels over 3 times the upper limit of normal present at first biopsy.

In Mexico, the Information and Motivation and Behavioral Skills (IMB) Model of ART Adherence constructs is useful in describing and predicting adherence behaviors in various samples but has not been articulated to people living with HIV (PLWH) on ART. The aim of this was to characterize the IMB core constructs and identify correlates of ART adherence in an HIV-positive clinic sample in Mexico. A convenience sample of 109 HIV-positive patients attending their monthly visits at a local public hospital were interviewed with the Spanish version of the LifeWindows IMB ART Adherence Questionnaire (LW-IMB-AAQ) as well as a sociodemographic questionnaire. All participants were recruited from a hospital-based outpatient clinical care site. Partial confirmation of the relationships proposed by the IMB Model of ART Adherence was found. As predicted by the model, only behavioral skills had direct association with all measures of self-reported adherence, and motivation was associated with behavioral skills. Information did not demonstrate significant relations to either motivation or behavioral skills, nor did it directly associate with adherence. Self-reported adherence did not associate with CD4 counts, nor did any of the IMB model core constructs. Applicability of the IMB Model of ART Adherence in this setting is discussed.

This study compared provider attitudes and practices in relation to counseling clients about mandatory disclosure in North Carolina and Alabama, the 2 states with similar HIV epidemiology but different laws for HIV control. Personal interviews were conducted with 20 providers in each state (n = 40). The results were analyzed in a qualitative, cross-comparison method to identify patterns of convergence or difference. Providers in both states believed that clients often failed to notify sexual partners and were secretive if questioned about disclosure. Differences in counseling styles and procedures for each state were noteworthy. Compared to Alabama, North Carolina had harsher penalties for nondisclosure, stricter and more standardized procedures for counseling, and providers expressed greater support for HIV criminalization. Although most North Carolina providers viewed the stricter standards as beneficial for HIV care and control, Alabama providers were likely to view such standards as a barrier to patient care.

A multinational, multicenter, observational, retrospective cross-sectional evaluation of a population of focus comprised randomly selected patients on HAART. The dependent variable was adherence to HAART. The primary variable of interest to be assessed was patients' level of depressive symptom score. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to examine the relationship between explanatory variables and adherence to HAART. A total of 2344 patients were recruited for adherence survey. About 70% of the study sample reported having some level of depression. Logistic regression results show that patients who reported, respectively, low, moderate, and high levels of depressive symptoms are 35% (P &lt; .001), 56% (P &lt; .001), and 64% (P &lt; .001) less likely to adhere to HAART than those who reported having no depressive symptoms. At multivariate analysis, adherence to HAART was independently associated with the levels of depressive symptoms, older age, CD4 count &gt;200 cells\/mm3, Truvada (tenofovir [TDF]\/emtricitabine [FTC])-based regimens, good knowledge about HAART, and longer period on therapy. These results indicate that mental health and clinical parameters are significant factors in determining patients' adherence to their HAART, which need to be more aggressively addressed as a critical component of care and treatment support. ","402":"Few global studies have assessed HIV clinician-patient communication regarding cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks. We conducted a multicountry, comparative, cross-sectional survey of HIV-infected individuals in 12 countries on 5 continents in 2010, with 100 to 200 enrollees per country. HIV-infected adults &gt;17 years and on antiretroviral therapy were recruited in clinics and community organizations and surveyed via direct interview, telephone encounter, or online. Chi-square analyses were performed with an 80% power to detect a difference of &gt;20%. Of 2035 participants, 37% were women. Prevalence of self-reported CVD risk factors was 28% overall, and greater CVD risk was present in 55% of patients in North America, 12% in Africa, and 26% to 28% on other continents. Only 19% of patients ever discussed CVD with their physician, and 31% had ever discussed hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, family history of CVD, or smoking; these findings were true for HIV clinicians in all regions of the world. Forty-four percent of smokers reported never discussing smoking with their HIV clinician. We found that HIV clinicians worldwide are not sufficiently addressing CVD risk factors with their patients. Expanded training and education for HIV clinicians should include effective approaches to the mitigation of CV risk factors. ","403":"Postnatal depression (PND) is a major problem in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A total of 210 postpartum mothers attending primary care urban clinics were screened for PND at 6 weeks postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition; DSM-IV) criteria for major depression. The HIV prevalence was 14.8%. Of the 210 enrolled postpartum mothers, 64 (33%) met DSM IV criteria for depression. Using trained peer coun- selors, mothers with PND (n = 58) were randomly assigned to either group problem-solving therapy (PST, n = 30) or amitriptyline (n = 28). Of the 58 mothers with PND, 49 (85%) completed 6 weeks of group PST (n = 27) or pharmacotherapy (n = 22). At baseline, the mean EPDS score for participants randomized to group PST was 17.3 (standard deviation [SD] 3.7), while the group randomized to amitriptyline had a mean EPDS score of 17.9 (SD 3.9; P = .581). At 6 weeks postintervention, the drop in mean EPDS score was greater in the PST group (8.22, SD 3.6) compared to the amitriptyline group (10.7, SD 2.7; P = .0097). Group PST using peer counselors is feasible, acceptable, and more effective compared to pharmacotherapy in the treatment of PND. Group PST could be integrated into maternal and child health clinics and preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV programs in LMICs.","404":"Pain, sleep, and functional disturbances are a common occurrence in people living with HIV\/AIDS-related distal sensory peripheral neuropathy (PLWHA-DSPN) yet lack group classification and quantification. A total of 46 PLWHA-DSPN were recruited, as part of a 2-group intervention study, to complete the Neuropathic Pain Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaires. The participant's performance during a forward reach task and walking distance in 6 minutes was recorded as a measure of function. The pain (60.77 +\/- 17.85) and sleep (14.62 +\/- 4.28) scores denote marked pain and sleep disturbances, compared to seronegative, age-matched individuals. The ambulation distance was limited (243.99 +\/- 141.04 m) and inversely associated with the PSQI-sleep efficiency subscale (rs = -.35, P &lt; .05). The average reaching distances measured (36.07 +\/- 7.37 cm) were similar to seronegative, age-matched individuals. Pain, sleep, and functional measures exhibited significant associations. The data collected suggest that PLWHA-DSPN report moderate-to-severe pain and significant sleep disturbances and exhibit limited ambulation distances. ","405":"CD4 counts vary in different populations. The present study was conducted to determine CD4 counts in different World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stages in antiretroviral therapy naive individuals and to find out optimum CD4 cutoffs. Data of adult HIV seropositive patients who underwent CD4 count and total lymphocyte count (TLC) testing were included for analysis. The severity of immunosuppression was graded based on WHO criteria. To establish optimum CD4 cutoff values, receiver-operator characteristics (ROC) curves were generated. Of 754 patients, 52.2% had CD4 counts &lt;200 cells\/mm3, but only 2.3% belonged to WHO stage IV. Newer CD4 cutoffs generated were 280, 120-280, &lt;120 cells\/mm3. Spearman rank correlation between CD4 counts and TLC was found to be weak (r = .32). The cutoff values of CD4 counts for HIV disease may need to be revised for India. Regular CD4 count estimation is a must for monitoring disease progression in people living with HIV\/AIDS. ","406":"Patients with HIV are at increased risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoma, which is the most common malignancy leading to death. With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), patients live longer but have a longer duration of antigenic stimulation, increasing the prevalence of AIDS-related lymphoma (ARL) in the population living with HIV. Highly active antiretroviral therapy plays a direct role in preserving the immune system, helping to decrease the incidence of ARL. We present a case of a female patient with HIV (CD4 count of 576 cells\/mm3) diagnosed with a stage Ill-B non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2009 while off HAART. She was subsequently started on HAART, leading to full resolution of her lymphoma without any chemotherapeutic intervention. She was last seen in the clinic in December 2013 without any evidence of recurrence of her lymphoma. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a stage III-B non-Hodgkin&lt;in lymphoma in an HIV-infected patient, which resolved with only HAART.","407":"Rhodococcus equi, previously called Corynebacterium equi, is known to cause pneumonia in foals and swine. Although it was known to cause infection rarely in humans, R equi infection in humans has increased with the advent of HIV and increased use of immunosuppressants. We report a case of a 48-year-old male patient with newly diagnosed HIV\/AIDS presenting with recurrent R equi bacteremia, pericardial effusion, and pericardial cyst. The infection was treated with drainage of the pericardial effusion and cyst and 2 weeks of intravenous vancomycin and 6 months of oral azithromycin and levofloxacin. Rhodococcus equi causes pericarditis and pericardial effusion. It can be effectively treated with debridement, drainage, and a prolonged course of antibiotics. In vitro antibiotic susceptibility should be checked as resistance to antibiotics can develop, especially if drainage is inadequate. ","408":"HIV\/AIDS stigma continues to be a challenge for HIV prevention and treatment. When health professionals manifest stigma it can limit access to quality treatment. With an ever-growing epidemic among Latinos, including Puerto Ricans living on the Caribbean Island, the social and structural factors that foster HIV\/AIDS stigma need to be understood. In this study, we documented the association of religion with HIV\/AIDS stigma in a sample of medical students in Puerto Rico. Findings suggest that importance placed on religion, and participation in religious activities, is associated with HIV\/AIDS stigma for this population.","409":"Despite numerous potential health outcomes of dog guardianship, their value has not been examined in the HIV-positive population. The study objective was to examine the relationship between dog guardianship and HIV clinical outcomes (antiretroviral adherence [&gt;95% versus &lt;95%], HIV viral load [&gt; or =48 versus &lt;48 copies\/mL], and CD4 count) among HIV-positive individuals. The authors conducted a secondary analysis of baseline data of 370 HIV-positive men on antiretroviral regimen enrolled in the Duo Project. Generalized estimating equations were used for inferential regression analyses, while controlling for the focal dog guar- dianship variable and nonfocal covariates. Current dog guardianship was reported in 28.7% of participants. Dog guardianship may be associated with higher CD4 (coefficient = 60.6, P = .052) and adherence &gt;95% (odds ratio [OR] = 1.80, P = .048); however, having a detectable viral load was not related to dog guardianship (OR = 0.94, P = .85). Further clinical research with detailed dog guardianship data is needed to further examine the association between dog guardianship and HIV clinical outcomes.","410":"HIV-associated immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) has decreased in incidence 10-fold since the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). For patients with detectable HIV viral loads, first-line treatment approaches involve optimizing HAART followed by standard ITP options used to treat those without HIV infection. In the general population, the thrombopoetin receptor agonists (TRAs), eltrombopag and romiplostim, are effective when used as salvage ITP therapy. In addition, eltrombopag has been used effectively in patients with thrombocytopenia secondary to hepatitis C--a virus seen commonly in HIV-infected patients, especially in those who also have a history of intravenous drug use. There are, however, few reports or studies of TRAs use in those with HIV infection. Herein, we describe 5 cases of refractory HIV-associated ITP managed with TRAs. Although platelet counts improved for all patients, 2 patients succumbed to thromboembolic complications. Our initial experience, as well as our findings from a Medline review, supports the potential utility of TRA as salvage therapy in the treatment of HIV-related ITP; however, we recommend caution in the use of these agents in those who are at highest risk of thrombosis. Additional studies are needed to determine the efficacy and, more importantly, the safety of TRAs in treatment of HIV-associated ITP.","411":"HIV-associated neurocognitive disorders (HANDs) are common, often go undetected, and can impact treatment outcomes. There is limited evidence on how to perform routine cognitive screening in HIV clinical settings. To address this, 44 HIV-positive males were recruited from a Veteran Affairs Infectious Disease clinic and completed the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA), International HIV Dementia Scale (IHDS), and Depression Anxiety and Stress Scale-21. In all, 50% scored below the MoCA cutoff and 36% scored below the IHDS cutoff. Current CD4 was the strongest predictor of an abnormal MoCA score (P = .007, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 0.987-0.998) and elevated depression was the second strongest predictor (P = .008, CI: 1.043-1.326). Combination antiviral therapy use and age were not significant predictors in this model. The MoCA appeared to be a reasonable screening tool to detect cognitive impairment in HIV-positive patients, and although it is not sufficient to diagnose HAND, it has the potential to provide meaningful clinical data. ","412":"We report 2 cases coinfected with HIV and tuberculosis (HIV\/TB), requiring drug dose adjustments guided by therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) and\/or serum drug concentrations. Over the course of the 9-months of TB treatment, drugs that required increased doses due to low concentrations included efavirenz (800 mg), rifampin (900 mg), and isoniazid (450 mg). Higher drug doses were well tolerated until the end of treatment. Over the 12-month course of TB therapy, drugs that required increased doses due to incomplete and\/or delayed absorption were rifampin (1500 mg), moxifloxacin (800 mg), and ethambutol (1600 mg). Higher drug doses were well tolerated until the end of treatment. Due to delayed\/incomplete drug absorption and weight gain during therapy, higher antituberculous doses may be required in patients coinfected with HIV\/TB. A daily dose of efavirenz 800 mg was well tolerated in both patients (weight over 70 kg). Managing patients coinfected with HIV\/TB is complex, and, therefore, TDM of drug concentrations can help guide clinical decision making. ","413":"Anemia is a common problem in HIV in sub-Saharan Africa. We describe the contribution of antiretroviral therapy (ART) regimen to the incidence of anemia and changes in hemoglobin (Hb) in HIV-infected patients in Uganda. This study was nested in a prevention of cryptococcal disease trial (CRYPTOPRO; ISCRTN7648152). Patients received 3 different backbones of nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor in a nonrandomized manner. Of the 852 patients (161 on zidovudine [ZDV], 628 on stavudine [d4T], and 63 on tenofovir [TDF]; all received lamuvidine), the risk of developing grade 4 anemia was higher (adjusted hazard ratio 2.7) for those receiving ZDV than those receiving d4T. Those receivingd4T had a higher average increase in Hb than those receiving ZDV (P = .024) or TDF (P = .014). In this observational study, ZDV was associated with severe anemia compared to d4T or TDF; those receiving ZDV and TDF had smaller increases in Hb after ART initiation. We encourage publication of data on cohorts using TDF from Africa. ","414":"Health care workers (HCWs) seek, treat, and care for patients living with HIV\/AIDS on a daily basis and thus face a significant risk to work-related infections. To assess the knowledge, attitude, and practices regarding occupational HIV exposure and protection among HCWs in low HIV prevalence areas of rural China. A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was carried out among all medical units in Pucheng County, Shaanxi, China. Response rate of this study was 94%. The average overall knowledge score of HCWs was 10.9 of 21.0. Deficiencies in general, transmission, exposure, and protection knowledge were identified among HCWs at all levels. A high rate of occupational exposure (85%) and lack of universal precautions practice behavior were recorded. Significant predictors of universal precautions practice behavior were female sex, prior training, and greater knowledge about HIV\/AIDS. Health care workers at various levels have inadequate knowledge on HIV\/AIDS and do not practice universal precautions. Nurses and medical technicians at the county level faced more occupation risk than other HCWs. The key of AIDS training for different levels of HCWs should be distinguished. ","415":null,"416":"In 2006, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended HIV testing for all adolescents and adults aged 13 to 64 in health care settings with a HIV prevalence of at least 0.1%. However, 55% of US adults have never been tested and therefore do not know their HIV status. To understand suboptimal HIV testing rates, this study sought to illuminate interpersonal and intrapersonal physician barriers to HIV testing. One hundred and eighty physicians from health centers in Houston completed a survey based on Cabana's Knowledge, Attitudes and Behaviors model. One-third of the physicians faced at least 1 interpersonal barrier to HIV testing, such as a difference in age or language. Many (41%) physicians faced at least 1 intrapersonal barrier, such as believing their patients would be feeling uncomfortable discussing HIV. Notably, 71% of physicians would prefer their patients ask for the test. A patient-engaging campaign may be an innovative solution to increasing HIV testing and reducing the number of undiagnosed persons.","417":"Non-adherence to antiretroviral (ART) treatment remains a prevalent problem even among the segment of the U.S. HIV population that is 'linked' to medical care. Controlled pilot feasibility study with ART experienced adult patients (n = 20) linked to HIV medical care without suppressed viral load. Patients were randomized to a peer-led HIV medication adherence intervention named `Ready' or a time equivalent `healthy eating' control arm. Lay individuals living with HIV were trained to facilitate `Ready'. Patients had been prescribed a mean of three prior ART regimens. The group randomized to `Ready' had significantly improved adherence. MEMS and pharmacy refill data correlated with viral load log drop. Higher readiness for healthful behavior change correlated with viral load drop and approached significance. A peer-led medication adherence intervention had a positive impact among adults who had experienced repeated non-adherence to HIV treatment. A larger study is needed to examine intervention dissemination and efficacy. ","418":"Guidelines for antiretroviral therapy (ART) initiation have evolved, but consistently note that adherence problems should be considered and addressed. Little is known regarding the reasons providers delay ART initiation in clinically eligible patients. In 2009, we surveyed a probability sample of HIV care providers in 582 outpatient facilities in the United States and Puerto Rico with an open-ended question about nonclinical reasons for delaying ART initiation in otherwise clinically eligible patients. Very few providers (2%) reported never delaying ART. Reasons for delaying ART were concerns about patient adherence (68%), patient acceptance (60%), and structural barriers (33%). Provider and practice characteristics were associated with reasons for delaying ART. Reasons for delaying ART were consistent with clinical guidelines and were both patient level and structural. Providers may benefit from training and access to referrals for ancillary services to enhance their ability to monitor and address these issues with their patients. ","419":"Depression is common among people living with HIV\/AIDS (PLWHA) in sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), and can have significant consequences for HIV disease progression, treatment response and prevention. Yet mental health services are limited in most HIV care programs in this region, in part due to severe shortages of mental health professionals. To address the need for establishing an effective, sustainable model for integrating depression treatment into HIV care in SSA, we have embarked upon a 3-year research project, INDEPTH Uganda (INtegrating DEPression Treatment and in HIV care in Uganda), to evaluate a task-sharing, protocolized approach to providing antidepressant care in ten HIV clinics in Uganda. In this paper we share our experiences with two treated cases identified during the initial days of implementation, which we believe highlight the potential value and policy implications for task shifting depression care models in under-resourced settings. ","420":null,"421":"This study evaluates the frequency and determinants of preventive care counseling by HIV medical care providers (HMCPs) during encounters with newly diagnosed and established HIV-infected patients. Data used were from a probability sample of HMCPs in Houston\/Harris County, Texas, surveyed in 2009. Overall, HMCPs offered more preventive care counseling to newly diagnosed than the established patients (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 7.28; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 2.86-16.80). They were more likely to counsel newly diagnosed patients than the established ones on medication and adherence (AOR = 14.70; 95% CI = 1.24-24.94), HIV risk reduction (AOR = 5.91; 95% CI = 0.48-7.13), and disease screening (AOR = 7.20; 95% CI = 0.72-11.81). HIV medical care providers who were less than 45 years of age, infectious disease specialists, and had less than 30 minutes of encounter time were less likely to counsel patients regardless of the status. Our findings suggest the need for HMCPs to improve their preventive care counseling efforts, in order to help patients build skills for adopting and maintaining safe behavior that could assist in reducing the risk of HIV transmission.","422":"The objective of this study was to identify determinants of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) knowledge regarding mother-to-child transmission (MTCT) among pregnant women at Tijuana General Hospital, Baja California, Mexico. Between March and November 2003, patients from the prenatal care (n = 1294) and labor and delivery (L&amp;D) units (n = 495) participated in a cross-sectional study to measure HIV knowledge. Less than one-third (30%) knew that HIV could be transmitted to a child during delivery, and 36% knew that HIV could be transmitted by breast-feeding. Only 27% knew that an MTCT could be prevented. Prenatal patients were more likely to know that MTCT was preventable (prenatal: 31% versus L&amp;D 25%; P = .02). Logistic regression indicated that prenatal patients (odds ratio = 1.49, confidence interval 1.07-2.07) were more likely to know that HIV could be transmitted through breast-feeding. Overall, both groups had poor knowledge regarding MTCT of HIV. ","423":"As individuals with HIV infection are living longer, the management of psychiatric disorders has increasingly been incorporated into comprehensive care. Individuals were recruited from an outpatient HIV clinic to assess the prevalence and related associations of current psychiatric disorders and biomarkers. Of the 201 participants who completed the interviews, the median age was 43.5 years, and the majority was male and African American. Most were receiving HIV therapy and 78% of those had achieved virologic suppression. Prevalent psychiatric diagnoses included major depressive disorder, generalized anxiety, and agoraphobia. Alcohol and cocaine\/crack abuse and dependence were common substance use disorders. Current receipt of HIV therapy was less common among those diagnosed with generalized anxiety disorder. Agoraphobia was the only disorder associated with unsuppressed viral load. Psychiatric and substance use disorders are highly prevalent among an urban HIV clinic population, although we identified few associations between psychiatric diagnoses and HIV diseases status. ","424":"We compared perceptions of partner HIV status to HIV test results in a cross-sectional study of sexual networks of men who have sex with men (MSM) in Atlanta. We then examined differences between black and white MSM in the predictive value of perceived partner status. We recruited men (\"seeds\") using time-space venue sampling. These seeds then referred up to three partners, who could also refer partners. All participants reported sexual behavior and HIV status for recent partners and received HIV tests. For partners who enrolled, we compared laboratory diagnoses to their partner's perception of their status. Black MSM who perceived themselves to be HIV negative were more likely than perceived-negative white MSM to have a positive partner among those they perceived to be HIV negative or whose status was unknown to them (OR=6.6). Furthermore, although frequency of unprotected anal intercourse (UAI) was similar by race, black men were more likely to have had UAI with an unknown-positive partner (OR=9.3). ","425":"In 2012, the US Food and Drug Administration approved Truvada as a pre-exposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for adults at risk of HIV. PrEP is highly effective at preventing HIV when taken daily, but no gold standard exists for consistently administering PrEP to populations at highest risk. The \"I Am Men's Health\" program used an innovative methodology to generate adherence to PrEP in 23 mostly young men who have sex with men of color (yMSMc), during a 28-week period from February to September 2013. Adherence was measured using weekly medication pickup rates. The average age of the participants was 21 years, and the majority were black and lived below the poverty line. Time on PrEP ranged from 1 to 28 weeks (2723 person-days), and the weighted average adherence was 73%. The methodology used in this study was preliminarily effective at generating adherence to PrEP among high-risk yMSMc in a community setting and may help inform large-scale future HIV prevention interventions.

However, the magnitude of this problem remains largely uninvestigated despite having the largest number of population with HIV\/AIDS. The aim of this study is to determine the prevalence of HAND among patients attending a tertiary health facility in Nigeria. We conducted a cross-sectional study among HIV-positive patients on antiretroviral therapy (ART) for at least 1 year. They were assessed using the International HIV Dementia Scale, Word Recall Test, Stick Design Test, Subjective Cognitive Complaint Questionnaire, Alcohol Use Disorder Identification Test, Drug Abuse Screening Test, Center for Epidemiological Study-Depression Scale, Instrumental Activity of Daily Living, and neurological examination. The CD4 count and viral load were determined for all the participants. A consensus diagnosis was made on each case based on the Frascati criteria. Data obtained were analyzed using \"SPSS\" for Windows version 15. A total of 418 HIV-positive patients participated in the study, of which 325 (77.8%) are females. The mean age (standard deviation) of the participants was 37.2 (9.3) years. The prevalence of HAND was 21.5% (95% confidence interval [CI] = 17.6%-25.4%), of which 9.6% were asymptomatic. The significant predictors of HAND in this study are duration of illness (odds ratio [OR] = 1.33 P &lt; .001), detectable viral load (OR = 0.19, P &lt; .001), CD4 count (OR = 0.99, P &lt; .001), education (OR = 0.94, P = .011), stopping medication (OR = 3.55 P = .01), and severity of illness (OR = 1.24, P = .005). One-fifth of the HIV-positive patients in this study had HAND. Various sociodemographic and clinical features were related to the prevalence of HAND. ","430":"Participants were recruited from a sexually transmitted disease (STD) clinic in Florida and were assessed regarding the knowledge and awareness of non-AIDS conditions associated with HIV infection. Questionnaires were administered before and after a brief information session on non-AIDS conditions associated with HIV infection. Participants included men (n = 46) and women (n = 51). Prior to the information session, at baseline, only 34% of the participants were worried about HIV infection. Most participants (82%) agreed that HIV could be treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART), while only 38% were aware that HIV-associated conditions cannot be easily treated with ART. After the information session, almost all participants reported they were concerned regarding the risk of HIV infection. High-risk patients may have limited knowledge about the consequences of HIV infection beyond the traditional AIDS-associated conditions. Increased awareness of these less known consequences of HIV infection may decrease the potential for complacency regarding acquiring HIV infection. ","431":null,"432":"Few cases of HIV and neurocysticercosis co-infection have been reported till date. The symptomatic manifestation of cysticercosis may be further reduced by interactions between the 2 disease processes. In patients with HIV, the diagnosis of neurocysticercosis is challenging and management must be individualized depending on the stage and the coexistent opportunistic conditions. We present 2 such cases. First was a 35-year-old driver seropositive for HIV-1 presented with complex partial seizures and a CD4 count of 530 cells\/mm(3). The second case was a 40-year-old businessman with a CD4 count of 350 cells\/mm(3). Both of them had multiple parenchymal lesions, with 1 being a large cystic lesion. Relatively high CD4 count and a positive enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay increased the likelihood for diagnosis and treatment. Both of our patients received cysticidal therapy, and none of them deteriorated with treatment. ","433":"The study describes the HIV care providers' sociodemographic and medical practice characteristics and the health care services offered to patients during medical care encounters in Houston\/Harris County, Texas. We used data from the pilot cycle of the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Medical Monitoring Project Provider Survey conducted in June to September 2009. The average age and HIV care experience of the providers were 46.7 and 11.7 years, respectively, and they provided care to an average of 113 patients monthly. The average proportion of HIV-infected patients seen per month by race\/ethnicity was 43.3% for blacks, 28.5% for whites, 26.6% for Hispanics, 1.3% for Asians, and 0.6% for other races. A total of 67% of providers offered HIV testing to all patients 13 to 64 years of age. Most HIV care providers (73.9%) reported that patients in their practices sought HIV care only after experiencing symptoms. Understanding the HIV care delivery system from providers' perspectives may help enhance support services, patients' ongoing care and retention, leading to improved health outcomes.","434":"Once-daily (QD), combination antiretroviral therapy (ART) can impact the willingness and ability of patients to take medications as directed. The impact of antiretroviral (ARV) drug adherence influenced by single-tablet (STR) versus multi-tablet regimens (MTR) among patients enrolled in the AIDS Drug Assistance Program (ADAP) in a rural environment has not yet been assessed. A retrospective chart review evaluated adherence and outcomes in adult HIV-infected patients enrolled in the ADAP at 2 ambulatory clinics in the Southeast, taking either a QD STR (efavirenz [EFV]\/emtricitabine\/tenofovir [TDF]) or a QD protease inhibitor (PI)-based, MTR (atazanavir [ATV], ritonavir [RTV], and emtricitabine\/TDF) by evaluating pharmacy refill records, patient self-reported adherence, and virologic response. A total of 389 patient records were analyzed (STR, n = 165 versus MTR, n = 224). There were more males, a higher percentage of treatment-naive patients, and more patients with a baseline CD4 count of &gt;200 cells\/mm(3) in the MTR group. Based on refill records, more patients on MTR were &gt;90% adherent (61.6% versus 51.5%, P = .047). In a multivariable analysis, being treatment experienced was a negative predictor (odds ratio [OR] = 0.48, 0.29-0.78) for adherence. Regimen choice was not associated with adherence. More patients taking MTR were virologically suppressed at the end of the observation period. Regardless of the regimen, being &gt;90% adherent was a significant predictor of virologic suppression (OR = 3.51, 1.98-6.23). Treatment-experienced patients enrolled in ADAP are less likely to be adherent. A QD PI-based MTR may result in comparable adherence to an STR in a rural HIV-infected population. ","435":"We sought to measure resident physician knowledge of HIV epidemiology and screening guidelines, attitudes toward testing, testing practices, and barriers and facilitators to routine testing. Resident physicians in internal medicine, pediatrics, obstetrics and gynecology, and emergency medicine were surveyed. Overall response rate was 63% (162 of 259). Half knew details of the HIV screening guidelines, but few follow these recommendations. Less than one-third reported always or usually performing routine testing. A significant proportion reported only sometimes or never screening patients with risk factors. This was despite a strong belief that HIV screening improves patient care and public health. The most common barriers to testing were competing priorities and forgetting to order the test. Elimination of written consent and electronic reminders was identified as facilitators to routine testing. Although an institutional policy assigns responsibility for test notification and linkage of HIV-positive patients to care to the HIV care program, only 29% were aware of this. Few resident physicians routinely screen for HIV infection and some don't test patients with risk factors. While competing priorities remain a significant barrier, elimination of written consent form and electronic reminders has facilitated testing. Increasing the awareness of policies regarding test notification and linkage to care may improve screening. ","436":"This study was conducted to evaluate the clinical experience with daptomycin in the treatment of resistant gram-positive infections (GPIs) in patients with HIV infection. Using a retrospective, multicenter, and observational registry study, investigators assessed outcomes following daptomycin therapy in 78 patients (62 efficacy evaluable) infected with HIV and with resistant GPIs. Overall, success rates by infection type were bacteremia 91% (20 of 22), endocarditis 91% (10 of 11), and bone\/joint 100% (9 of 9). Success by pathogen was 93% (39 of 42), 93% (14 of 15), and 100% (5 of 5) for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, vancomycin-resistant enterococci, and methicillin-resistant coagulase-negative staphylococci, respectively. Daptomycin appeared to be well tolerated, with 9% having an adverse event possibly related to daptomycin and 4% discontinuing daptomycin. In HIV-infected patients, daptomycin appears to be a useful agent for treating resistant GPIs. ","437":"Frailty is common in HIV-infected patients, but its causes are elusive. We assessed 122 clinic patients for frailty using the 5-measure Fried Frailty criteria. The prevalence of frailty was 19% (n = 23) and all frail patients reported exhaustion with a Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale score &gt;16 indicating depression. The next most common criterion was low physical activity (expenditure of kcal\/week). Markers of sarcopenia such as decreased grip strength and decreased gait speed, hallmarks of frailty in the elderly, were the least common of the 5 criteria. Frailty was reversible: 6 frail patients returned for reassessment and only 2 were frail. We conclude that frailty in the HIV-infected patients is potentially reversible and strongly associated with depression and low physical activity, whereas frailty in the elderly is associated with aging-related sarcopenia and is often irreversible. ","438":"We report the case of a 33-year-old HIV-infected man who presented with a recurrent, nonhealing perianal fistula. After multiple benign biopsies, the diagnosis of plasmablastic lymphoma (PBL) eventually was made. The patient underwent chemotherapy and radiation with a complete response. Perianal fistulas are frequent in HIV-positive patients, but PBL as a cause is extremely rare. This often delays the diagnosis and treatment of this highly aggressive disease. We review the literature and discuss the pitfalls in the diagnosis and management of the disease. ","439":null,"440":"Adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) is essential to optimize HIV treatment outcomes. Among individuals on ART, targeted peer support has been found to support adherence. This study of Zambian heterosexual couples living with HIV examined whether partners would exert a positive influence on each other's adherence, and compared adherence between couples in which either one or both members were on ART. Couples (n = 446 participants), in which either or both member were on ART were assessed at baseline, 6 and 12 months. Most participants (64%, n = 263) were on ART; overall, uptake of ART increased to 74% at 12 months. At baseline, 76% reported near perfect adherence; at 6 and 12 months, 66% and 70% were adherent, respectively. A regression analysis indicated that the decline in adherence did not differ between those couples in which one or both partners were on ART [F (2, 624) = 0.37, p = .692]. Pairwise comparison indicated that adherence primarily decreased between baseline and 6 months (t = 2.72, p = .007), and was stable 6 to 12 months. This study of couples in Zambia found adherence was not enhanced by having a partner on ART, and that adherence declined over time. Partners on ART may not necessarily provide support for adherence to each other. Partners may represent an untapped resource for optimizing adherence; results highlight the need for provider guidance and structured adherence interventions targeting partner adherence support. ","441":"Age is a key determinant of mortality due to diseases including HIV infection. A retrospective and descriptive cohort study used a computerized database to compare HIV-infected patients diagnosed in late adulthood to a group of patients diagnosed before their 49 years of age, without matching the characteristics of HIV infection. The study included patients who visited the day hospital (outpatient clinic) of the Sanou Souro Teaching Hospital of Bobo-Dioulasso, in Burkina Faso, from January 2007 to December 2011. Older adults were defined as those aged 50 years and more. Participants in the study consisted of 2572 patients (265 older adults and 2307 young patients living with HIV. Based on Markov chain method, 32.1% of the older adults living with HIV were found to be seroconvert at 50 years or older. The median follow-up time on antiretroviral treatment (ART) was 32.7 months (range 0.03-65.4 months). Two hundred and ninety-five (11.5%) patients died, including 21.1% of older adults and 10.4% of young (P &lt; .01). World Health Organization stage 3 or 4 and the lowest CD4 count reached &lt;200 cells\/mm(3) were the factors associated with early mortality of older adults on ART. Mortality rate of older adult patients living with HIV in Burkina Faso is high. Early diagnosis, early treatment, and primary prevention of HIV infection in the older adults are the main keys that could help reduce such mortality. ","442":"New York State (NYS) established guidelines for nonoccupational post-exposure prophylaxis (nPEP) to HIV in 1997. To assess current nPEP practices in NYS Emergency Departments (EDs), we electronically surveyed all ED directors in NYS, excluding Veterans' Affairs hospitals, about nPEP and linkage-to-care protocols in the EDs. Basic descriptive statistics were used for analysis. The response rate was 96% (184\/191). Of respondents, 88% reported evaluating any patient with a possible nonoccupational exposure to HIV, in accordance with NYS guidelines. Of these, 83% provided the patient with a starter pack of medications, while 4% neither supplied nor prescribed antiretroviral drugs in the ED. Sexually transmitted infection screening, risk reduction counseling, and education about symptoms of acute HIV seroconversion were performed inconsistently, despite NYS guidelines recommendations. Only 22% of EDs confirmed whether linkage to follow-up care was successful. Most NYS EDs prescribe nPEP to appropriate patients but full implementation of guidelines remains incomplete. ","443":"We report the psychometric properties of 2 Spanish-language scales designed to measure (1) opinions about HIV in the community and particularly among health care workers and (2) observed acts of stigma toward people living with HIV\/AIDS (PLWHA) by health care workers. The Opinions about HIV Scale included 3 components (policy, avoidance, and empathy) and 9 items, while an adapted version of the HIV\/AIDS Stigma Instrument-Nurse, designed to capture acts of stigma, included 2 components (discrimination related to clinical care and refusal to share or exchange food\/gifts). Scales demonstrated good reliability and construct validity. Relative to community health workers, treatment supporters were more likely to have stigmatizing opinions related to avoidance and empathy. We offer 2 Spanish-language scales that could be used to identify populations with high levels of stigmatizing opinions and behaviors toward PLWHA. Formal training of health care workers, especially treatment supporters, may raise awareness and reduce stigma toward HIV.

Worldwide about 150 million people are chronically infected by hepatitis C virus (HCV), and 60% to 70% of them will develop severe liver disease. This article describes Brazil's response to hepatitis C, from the first steps in 1993 to a national program in 2002. We reviewed the available literature, most of it in Brazilian Portuguese, and compiled them in order to share this experience with those seeking some pragmatic solutions. After 12 years, the national program has achieved universal coverage of treatment, resulting in saved lives and resources for the health system. There is abundant evidence that the HCV epidemic deserves attention. The overall consequence of long-term HCV infection is a negative impact on the health care economy. The Brazilian experience can be adapted to many countries in the world, in compliance with the 2010 World Health Organization World Health Assembly Resolution. ","446":null,"447":"The purpose of this qualitative study was to develop a theoretical model describing the disability experienced by older adults living with HIV. Forty nine HIV positive men and women over the age of 50 years participated in in-depth qualitative interviews. Transcribed interviews were analyzed using grounded theory techniques. Uncertainty or worrying about the future was at the core of the model. Components of disability including symptoms and impairments, difficulties with day to day activities and challenges to social participation were experienced in the context of extrinsic or environmental factors (social support, stigma) and intrinsic contextual factors (positive living strategies, age). Time was an overarching component of the model. The model suggests areas for interventions to prevent or reduce disability related to the consequences of aging with HIV and improve overall quality of life.

This is a qualitative study done to explore perceptions and meanings of hope among PLWH attending care and treatment clinics in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania. In all, 10 focus group discussions and 9 in-depth interviews were conducted. People living with HIV described the following 3 dimensions of hope: cognitive, positive emotions, and normalization. Being cognizant of the effectiveness of antiretroviral treatment (ART) often led to positive emotions, such as feeling comforted or strengthened, which in turn was related to positive actions toward normalizing life. Improved treatment outcomes facilitated hope, while persistent health problems, such as ART side effects, were sources of negative emotions contributing to loss of hope among PLWH. Hope motivated positive health-seeking behaviors, including adherence to ART, and this may guide interventions to help PLWH cope and live positively with HIV.","452":null,"453":"This community-based cross-sectional epidemiological study was performed to assess the awareness and attitude of youths toward AIDS in a rural area of West Bengal in India. Study population included 190 individuals (15-24 years). Data were collected using a semistructured, pretested questionnaire and analyzed using SPSS version 17 by logistic regression model. It was revealed that older youths and particularly men compared to women had more comprehensive knowledge of AIDS than adolescents. Education, media exposure, marriage, and possessing above poverty level (APL) status, all had stronger positive association with youths (more in men) having comprehensive knowledge of AIDS. Older, never married youths, and particularly men were more likely than adolescents to have accepting attitudes toward people living with HIV\/AIDS. Education, media exposure, and not having below poverty level card, all had stronger positive association with youths having accepting attitudes toward women than toward men. Surprisingly among the male APL population, this association was negative. Educational and socioeconomic setbacks should be overcome in order to impose a better and justified attitude toward HIV\/AIDS. Improved health conditions, proper counseling, and knowledge are essential to break the barriers of communication and ignorance toward HIV\/AIDS in these parts of the developing countries.

A cross-sectional study of pregnant women of unknown HIV status seeking care at Tijuana General Hospital, Mexico. Pregnant women attending the labor and delivery unit or the prenatal clinic had a rapid HIV test drawn, with positive results confirmed by Western blot. Migrants were defined as women who had resided in Tijuana for less than 5 years. Between 2007 and 2008, a total of 3331 pregnant women consented to participate. The HIV seroprevalence did not differ between Tijuana residents (18 of 2502, 0.72%) and migrants (3 of 829, 0.36%, P = .32). In multivariate regression analyses, HIV acquisition risk behaviors included methamphetamine use (adjusted odds ratio [OR]: 6.03, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 2.3-15.8, P &lt; .001) and first presentation at labor (adjusted OR: 5.0, 95% CI: 1.6-15.3, P = .005), adjusted for migrant status, age, and history of sexually transmitted infections. The overall HIV seroprevalence was 0.63% and did not differ between Tijuana residents and migrants.

She was diagnosed with an intracerebral mass and treated as neurotoxoplasmosis with improvement in the first week of therapy. On the fourth week she had a clinical worsening evolving to death, receiving the diagnosis at necropsy.","458":"South African men who have sex with men (MSM) are at increased risk for HIV infection, and male condoms are fundamental to HIV prevention programs. We explored condom use experiences through in-depth interviews with 34 South African MSM from Cape Town and Port Elizabeth. For data analysis, we generated a codebook and used the constant comparison method. Condom use reinforcing elements included use of alternative sexual strategies, having a high level of self-worth that was linked to protective behaviors, and use of ready-made condom negotiation scripts. Elements inhibiting condom use included perceiving substantial declines in sexual pleasure\/performance, experiences of condom failure (possibly related to petroleum-based lubricant), and being in trusted relationships. Our findings suggest nuanced HIV prevention approaches such as bolstering condom negotiation skills based on successful tactics already in use. Further research is needed to address how to mitigate perceptions and experiences that condoms negatively impact sexual pleasure and performance.","459":"Adverse drug reactions (ADRs) to antiretroviral therapy (ART) are an important cause of hospitalization, treatment discontinuation, and regimen changes in both developed and developing countries. This study is the first to examine and understand ADRs in HIV-infected patients in Nicaragua. A retrospective descriptive study was conducted from May 2010 to March 2011, in a cohort of HIV-infected patients receiving ART at the largest public hospital in Managua, Nicaragua. Patients were identified based on ADRs reporting on a standardized antiretroviral pharmacotherapy form. Subsequently, chart reviews of these patients were performed in order to document the specific ADRs. Six hundred ninety-two patients on ART were included. The incidence of ADRs was 6.4% (95% confidence interval [CI] 4.5-8.2). Females demonstrated a higher incidence, that is, 10.2% (95% CI 5.3-15.1, P = .020). Patients treated with combinations of zidovudine (ZDV)\/lamivudine (3TC) and emtricitabine (FTC)\/tenofovir (TDF) had fewer ADRs (P &lt; .01) than those using other combinations. Five patients were hospitalized or had a prolonged hospitalization secondary to ADRs, with no mortality attributed to ADR. The most common manifestations of ADRs were central nervous system (20 of 44), gastrointestinal (12 of 44), and dermatologic (8 of 44) reactions. Adverse drug reactions were classified as \"likely ADRs\" (25 of 44) and \"possible ADRs\" (19 of 44). No ADRs were preventable. Adverse drug reactions most frequently affected the central nervous system. No ADR was life threatening. The frequency of ADRs in this Nicaraguan patient population was less than that reported from other studies in resource-limited settings. ","460":"Knowledge of risk factors for HIV transmission in high-risk population plays a critical role in averting the risk of HIV transmission. In Pakistan, injection drug users (IDUs) constitute the core risk group of HIV prevalence, where the epidemic has transitioned to a \"concentrated level.\" Still nothing is known about the role of knowledge in HIV transmission and HIV sero-conversion among IDUs in Pakistan. From 2009 to 2011, a nested case-control study was conducted in a cohort of 636 IDUs receiving harm reduction services in the mega city of Karachi. In multivariable regression analysis, 3 factors, namely HIV does not spread through unprotected sex (adjusted odds ratio [AOR]: 3.1, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.39-6.90, P value .01), HIV does not transmit by sharing syringes (AOR: 3.5, 95% CI 1.97-6.40, P value &lt;.00), and the risk of HIV cannot be minimized by using new syringe every time (AOR: 2.0, 95% CI 1.16-3.60, P value .01), were significantly associated with the incident cases of HIV. The study findings suggest the association between knowledge of HIV transmission and HIV sero-incident cases. ","461":"This study investigates the differences in severity and correlates of depression symptoms among 1069 men and 267 women living with HIV in Ontario, Canada, who completed the 20-item Center for Epidemiologic Studies Depression Scale (CES-D). Women had higher CES-D scores than that of men (median [interquartile range]: 13 [5-26] versus 9 [3-20], P=.0004). More women had total CES-D scores&gt;15 (mild-moderate depression; 44% versus 33%, P=.002) and &gt;21 (severe depression; 31% versus 23%, P=.003). Unlike men, at age 40, women's scores increased yearly (0.4 per increased year, P=.005). The distribution of scores differed by gender: There was no difference in the 10th percentile of depression scores, 0 (95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.0-1.0) but the 75th percentile of depression scores for women was 6 (95% CI: 2.0-10.0) points higher than that of men. Important gender differences exist in depression symptoms and in correlates of symptoms in people living with HIV.","462":null,"463":"In 2012, the American Academy of Pediatrics (AAP) and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) published recommendations that physicians should discuss with parents the benefits and risks of newborn male circumcision. Our objective was to assess physicians' perspectives of newborn male circumcision. A self-administered, cross-sectional electronic survey of US physicians was conducted in 2008 (N = 1500). Approximately one-third (33.2%) of the respondents reported that their current perspective was that the medical benefits outweigh the risks associated with newborn male circumcision and less than one-third (31.1%) reported they would recommend the procedure when counseling parents. In 2008, only about one-third of the physicians surveyed thought that the benefits of male circumcision outweighed the risks and recommended it to parents of newborn sons. These attitudes may be relevant to the declining circumcision rates in the United States. Repeat surveys may be useful, given the new AAP and ACOG recommendations.

Furthermore, HIV-associated amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) syndrome differs from the classical ALS in some key aspects.. A 44-year-old male presented with a history of insidious onset and gradually progressive asymmetric weakness of lower limbs. He also complained of thinning in both legs, the left leg more than the right since 1 year along with spontaneous twitching of muscles in both the thighs. On neurological examination, the assessment of higher mental functions was normal. There were no cranial nerve deficits. Motor power was grade 5\/5 (Medical Research Council scale) in both the upper limbs and 4+ at hips and knees bilaterally, 5 at right ankle, and 4+ at left ankle. All the deep tendon reflexes were brisk with extensor planter responses. There were no cerebellar signs or sensory deficits. HIV-1 was reactive in enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay. Electrophysiological studies were conducted per the MND protocol.None of the nerves studied showed an abnormal drop in compound muscle action potential amplitude with proximal stimulation. There was evidence of diffuse spontaneous activity, which manifests as fibrillation and fasciculation potentials in most muscles tested . Overall there seems to be sufficient evidence to implicate HIV as a potential cause of an ALS-like disorder, but one must also consider the possibility of coincidental HIV infection in patients who have sporadic ALS.","466":null,"467":"Given the emerging data suggesting the key role of brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) in the immune system, we assessed longitudinally whether BDNF depletions induced by hazardous alcohol use (HAU) would impact a response to antiretroviral therapy (ART). In a prospective single-site cohort, virological and immunological responses to ART in 200 hazardous and 200 nonhazardous users were obtained, along with plasma BDNF levels. Hazardous drinkers were more likely to have BDNF levels &lt;4000 pg\/mL (odds ratio [OR] = 1.6, P = .01). Participants with BDNF &lt;4000 pg\/mL were less likely to have CD4 counts of more than 500 cells\/mm(3) (P = .02) and to achieve viral suppression over the follow-up period (OR = 1.5, P = .03). Multivariate analysis confirmed the significant role of HAU and low BDNF in predicting viroimmune responses. Hazardous alcohol use was associated with BDNF alterations, which in turn were linked to a limited response to ART in terms of viral suppression and CD4 count improvements. ","468":"To asses morphological and morphometrical alterations of oral squamous epithelial cells in HIV infected individuals, and determine its diagnostic significance for HIV infection. Informed Consent was obtained from all study subjects. 40 adult HIV infected patients (experimental group) and 40 adult non-infected volunteers (control group) participated. Age, occupation, and relevant medical history were recorded. The following laboratory tests reports were recorded: complete blood cell counts, blood glucose levels, serum iron and erythrocyte sedimentation rate. Oral smears were collected from normal appearing tongue and buccal mucosa of the individuals by exfoliative cytology. The cells were morphologically analysed and the nuclear area (NA), the cytoplasmic area (CA) and the nucleus-to-cytoplasm area ratio (NA\/CA) were calculated. Cell yield, cell cohesion, presence\/absence of inflammatory cells and candida were observed. The cytological smears of HIV patients showed abundant cell yield and the epithelial cells were found to be in close cohesive clusters and both findings were found to be statistically significant. Nuclear cytoplasmic ratio was seen to be increased in 93.8% of HIV positive patientsand Mild to moderate pleomorphism was observed in 17.9% of HIV positive patients. HIV positive patients had a diminished inflammatory response and this was found to be statistically significant. Statistically significant deviations from normal oral epithelium were found in the study conducted. With further research, oral exfoliative cytology may form a new, painless, inexpensive diagnostic method for HIV infections. ","469":"Cerebellar complications of HIV infection primarily manifested in ataxia, usually arise as the result of cerebellar lesions due to opportunistic infections, vasculitis or neoplastic processes. A 28 year old female known to have HIV infection for last four years, presented to our hospital with progressive unsteadiness in walking, slurring of speech and intention tremors for the last two months. There was no family history of similar complaints, and she was on Anti retroviral treatment for last one and a half years. The results of examination were notable for severe dysarthria, slow saccades, a conspicuous dysmetria and dysdiadokokinesia. She had no cognitive, sensory or motor deficits. MRI revealed diffuse cerebellar atrophy. Extensive laboratory work up failed to disclose a cause for subacute ataxia. Isolated cerebellar degeneration in an HIV patient is rare and should prompt a diagnostic work up.","470":"An HIV transmission prevention program incorporating universal voluntary counseling and testing (UVCT) was conducted in a general practice (GP) clinic of a Thai hospital. Of the 494 participating patients, 356 (72%) accepted HIV-UVCT. Independent factors associated with HIV-UVCT acceptance included participating in the program after office hours (4-8 pm; P &lt; .001), living with domestic partner with no marriage (P = .01), and having primary school education or less (P = .02). The main reasons for declining HIV-UVCT were time constraint (38%) and perceiving self as no risk (35%). Among the 356 patients undergoing HIV-UVCT, having moderate to high HIV risk (P &lt; .001) and male sex (P = .01) were independently associated with low HIV risk perception. By HIV-UVCT, the rate of new HIV infection was 4 (1.1%) of 356 patients. Of these 4 newly diagnosed HIV-infected patients, 3 (75%) were homosexual men. The findings suggest feasibility of HIV-UVCT in our GP clinic and factors to be considered for improving the program.","471":"Children with HIV infection are often reported to be short. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence of HIV-associated short stature in HIV endemic setting. Data were obtained by retrospective review of the electronic medical records. Patients were grouped into various clinical categories. For each category, the proportion of patients with height-for-age Z score of less than -2 standard deviation [SD] and of less than -3 SD was determined. The prevalence of short stature (less than -2 SD) was 28.4%. Severe short stature (less than -3 SD) is more likely with percentage of CD4 &lt;15% (odds ratio [OR]: 3.30, confidence interval [CI]: 1.51-7.09, P = .002) and with males (OR: 1.49, CI: 1.19-1.87, P = .001). Severe short stature is more likely with viral load &gt;400 copies\/mL (OR 2.64, CI 1.27-5.38, P = .008) and poor adherence (&lt;95%; OR 1.72, CI 1.03-2.05, P = .037). In Botswana, short stature affects a quarter of HIV-infected children and severe short stature is associated with poor adherence to antiretroviral treatment, severe immunosuppression, and virologic failure. ","472":"In 2006, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommended routine HIV testing in health care settings and called for HIV testing campaigns targeting African Americans. In a 2011 national survey, 63% of African Americans wanted information on HIV testing. In our study, 176 African Americans were surveyed to determine channels and spokespersons for an HIV testing campaign. Among 9 media channels, the top 3 ranked as \"very likely\" to convince them to get HIV tested were television, poster, and brochure. Among 10 spokespersons, the top 3 were doctor, nurse, and \"real person like me.\" The media are a cost-effective strategy to promote HIV prevention. Posters and brochures are inexpensive and easy to reproduce for clinical settings. Television campaigns may be feasible in clinics with closed-circuit televisions. Research is needed on campaign messages. An effective health center HIV testing campaign may help mitigate the disproportionate toll HIV is having on African Americans. ","473":"The incidence of Kaposi's sarcoma (KS) decreased dramatically after the introduction of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). This study determined the ongoing incidence of and mortality from KS in HIV-infected adults from 1998-2012 in Fresno County, California. The role of virologic control and immune reconstitution was assessed. Incident cases were identified from the state Electronic HIV\/AIDS Reporting System (EHARS), the California Cancer Registry, and hospital records of the county HIV treatment center. From 1998-2012, the average incidence of KS was 0.51 cases per 100,000 person-years. Of the 66 cases of KS there were 20 deaths, with 85% of the mortality occurring in the first 12 months. Among patients on HAART achieving HIV RNA &lt;400 copies\/uL, but with a &lt;50 cell\/uL increase in CD4 count there was no improvement in mortality. The incidence of KS remains stable since 1998 with a 12-month mortality of 30%. ","474":"Patients living with HIV\/AIDS face large societal and medical challenges. Inviting patients to read their doctors' visit notes via secure electronic portals may empower patients and improve health. We investigated whether utilization and perceptions about access to doctors' notes differed among doctors and patients in an HIV\/AIDS clinic versus primary care setting. We analyzed pre- and 1-year postintervention data from 99 doctors and 3819 patients. HIV clinic patients did not report differences in perceived risks and benefits compared to primary care clinic patients, however, they were more likely to share notes with friends (33% versus 9%, P=.002), other health professionals (24% versus 8%, P=.03), or another doctor (38% versus 9%, P&lt;.0001). HIV clinic doctors were less likely than primary care doctors to change the level of candor in visit notes (P&lt;.04). Our findings suggest that HIV clinic patients and doctors are ready to share visit notes online.","475":"Physicians' ability to provide care to patients living with HIV\/AIDS (PLWHA) in the Eastern Caribbean is influenced by economic constraints, sociocultural norms that govern interpersonal interactions, and the pervasive stigma linked to the disease. Although the economic environment determines national capacity to acquire various treatment and monitoring technologies, Eastern Caribbean physicians respond to practicing in a resource-limited setting by making choices that are influenced by the collectivist ethos that governs interpersonal relationships. Through qualitative interviews, the study finds that the social stigma associated with the disease requires physicians to \"go the extra mile\" to provide care in ways that allow PLWHA to protect their privacy in small, closely networked societies.","476":"To determine the optimal time to track patients, we evaluated the outcomes of patients traced after missing their return visits at 3 periods, 8, 30, or 90 days, at the Infectious Diseases Clinic in Kampala, Uganda. During the study period from January to December 2011, the proportion of untraceable patients was 2 (4%) after 8 days, 12 (10%) after 30 days, and 13 (15%) after 90 days. More than 75% of the patients who died had a CD4 count of &lt;200 cells\/mm(3) at their last visit. In conclusion, tracking patients after 1 week of a missed return visit should be the preferred method of tracking. If resources are limited, patients with CD4 counts &lt;200 cells\/mm(3) need to be targeted for tracking, as they are most at risk of dying if they interrupt treatment.","477":"Few global studies have assessed HIV clinician-patient communication regarding cardiovascular disease (CVD) risks. We conducted a multicountry, comparative, cross-sectional survey of HIV-infected individuals in 12 countries on 5 continents in 2010, with 100 to 200 enrollees per country. HIV-infected adults &gt;17 years and on antiretroviral therapy were recruited in clinics and community organizations and surveyed via direct interview, telephone encounter, or online. Chi-square analyses were performed with an 80% power to detect a difference of &gt;20%. Of 2035 participants, 37% were women. Prevalence of self-reported CVD risk factors was 28% overall, and greater CVD risk was present in 55% of patients in North America, 12% in Africa, and 26% to 28% on other continents. Only 19% of patients ever discussed CVD with their physician, and 31% had ever discussed hypertension, hypercholesterolemia, family history of CVD, or smoking; these findings were true for HIV clinicians in all regions of the world. Forty-four percent of smokers reported never discussing smoking with their HIV clinician. We found that HIV clinicians worldwide are not sufficiently addressing CVD risk factors with their patients. Expanded training and education for HIV clinicians should include effective approaches to the mitigation of CV risk factors. ","478":"Bacillary angiomatosis (BA) is a rare manifestation of infection caused by Bartonella species, which leads to vasoproliferative lesions of skin and other organs. Bacillary angiomatosis affects individuals with advanced HIV disease or other immunocompromised individuals. In sub-Saharan Africa, despite the high prevalence of HIV infection and documentation of the causative Bartonella species in humans, mammalian hosts, and arthropod vectors, BA has only rarely been described. Three adult patients from Uganda and Kenya with deep purple dome-shaped papules or nodules of the skin underwent punch biopsies for histopathologic diagnosis. The biopsies of all 3 patients were sent to a local pathologist as well as to a dermatopathologist at the University of California, San Francisco. All 3 patients were clinically suspected to have Kaposi's sarcoma (KS), and local pathologists had interpreted the lesions as KS in 2 of the cases and nonspecific inflammation in the third. Histologic examination by dermatopathologists in the United States revealed nodular dermal proliferations of irregular capillaries lined by spindled to epithelioid endothelial cells. The surrounding stroma contained a mixed inflammatory infiltrate with lymphocytes, eosinophils, and neutrophils. Extracellular deposits of pale amphophilic granular material were noted in the surrounding stroma. A Warthin-Starry stain highlighted clumps of bacilli, confirming the diagnosis of BA. These 3 cases, to our knowledge, are the first reports of BA in East Africa in the biomedical literature. Each had been originally incorrectly diagnosed as KS. We speculate BA is underdiagnosed and underreported in resource-poor regions, such as sub-Saharan Africa, that have high endemic rates of HIV infection. ","479":null,"480":"There is limited information on efficacy and durability of second-line antiretroviral therapy (2NL) beyond 12 months in resource-limited settings. A total of 73 patients were enrolled into a prospective 2NL observational cohort in Nigeria. Second-line antiretroviral therapy consisted of lopinavir\/ritonavir plus nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. Time on 2NL ranged from 15 to 31 months. Genotypes were retrospectively done and not available to guide second-line regimen choice. At enrollment, median CD4 count was 121 cells\/mm3, and median time on first-line antiretroviral therapy (ISL) was 24 months. At 6 to 9 months on 2NL, 72.6% (intention to treat [ITT]) and 88.3% (on treatment [OT]) had an undetectable viral load (UDVL). At 12 months, 65.8% (ITT) and 90.57% (OT) had UDVL. At &gt;12 to 24 months and at &gt;24 months, 57.5% (ITT) and 91.3% (OT) had UDVL. No statistically significant association was observed between CD4 at 2NL start, sex, genotypic sensitivity score of 2NL, or tenofovir (TDF) use in ISL and viral suppression. Two patients developed major protease inhibitor mutations while on 2NL. We observed a high degree of viral suppression at 12 months and little loss of viral suppression thereafter.","481":null,"482":"The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention have recommended routinely testing patients (aged 13-64) for HIV since 2006. However, many physicians do not routinely test. From January 2011 to March 2012, we conducted 18 in-depth individual interviews and explored primary care physicians' perceptions of barriers and facilitators to implementing routine HIV testing in North Carolina. Physicians' comments were categorized thematically and fell into 5 groups: policy, community, practice, physician, and patient. Lack of universal reimbursement was identified as the major policy barrier. Participants believed endorsement from the United States Preventive Services Tasks Force would facilitate adoption of routine HIV testing policies. Physicians reported HIV\/AIDS stigma, socially conservative communities, lack of confidentiality, and rural geography as community barriers. Physicians believed public HIV testing campaigns would legitimize testing and decrease stigma in communities. Physicians cited time constraints and competing clinical priorities as physician barriers that could be overcome by delegating testing to nursing staff. HIV test refusal, low HIV risk perception, and stigma emerged as patient barriers. Physicians recommended adoption of routine HIV testing for all patients to facilitate and destigmatize testing. Physicians continue to experience a variety of barriers when implementing routine HIV testing in primary care settings. Our findings support multilevel approaches to enhance physician routine HIV testing in primary care settings. ","483":"Assessment of longitudinal adherence patterns on virologic and immunologic responses to HAART in perinatally acquired HIV patients has not been studied. Perinatally infected pediatric HIV patients with adherence documented at least twice and corresponding viral load and T-cell (%) data measured during 2008-2009 were studied. Multiple adherence measures were utilized to identify patients with persistent adherence, nonadherence, or alteration of adherence. Virologic and immunologic outcomes were assessed. Persistent adherence, nonadherence, and alteration of adherence to HAART were recorded in 41.9%, 8.1%, and 50.0% of 62 studied patients. Persistent adherence was associated with higher likelihood for persistent virologic suppression and lower risk for persistent virologic failure. Alteration of adherence to HAART is a significant predictor of persistent virologic failure and high viremia in perinatally infected HIV patients. Implementation of longitudinal adherence assessments may target patients with nonsustained adherence patterns and help decrease the risk for virologic failure and disease progression. ","484":"Effective follow-up of mother-infant pairs is critical for ensuring the success of preventing mother-to-child transmission (PMTCT) programs. The objective of this study was to identify factors associated with health outcomes of exposed infants in a PMTCT program in the Democratic Republic of Congo (DRC). Data were collected from January 2005 through December 2008 in 2 maternities in Kinshasa, DRC. The exposed infant's health status was used as outcome. Multiple logistic regressions were used to identify the determinants of infant outcomes. A total of 309 mother-infant pairs were included in this study. Younger maternal age, breast-feeding but weaning before the age of 6 months, and HIV testing of the child and a mother who is not sick were associated with better infant health outcome. The follow-up of mother-infant pairs in PMTCT programs remains critical and challenging. There is a need for innovative and efficient strategies to improve retention of mother-infant pairs in PMTCT programs. ","485":"This cross-sectional study approached emergency department (ED) patients after the treating physician's disposition decision to measure patient understanding of whether or not they had received an HIV test during their ED encounter. Of the 300 respondents, 24 were excluded due to missing data or because they had received an ED HIV test. Mean age was 41 years, 51% were men, 61% were black, and 29% had no high school degree. There were 5.8% (95% confidence interval: 3.5%-9.4%) who erroneously reported HIV test delivery during their ED course. Our results suggest a small but significant minority of patients falsely assume that they have been tested for HIV during their ED visit. This misperception could have broad implications, leading to less frequent subsequent testing, false reassurance of HIV-negative status, and inaccuracies in surveillance estimates or surveys that depend on self-report. ","486":"Patients with HIV are at increased risk of malignancy, particularly lymphoma, which is the most common malignancy leading to death. With the advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART), patients live longer but have a longer duration of antigenic stimulation, increasing the prevalence of AIDS-related lymphoma (ARL) in the population living with HIV. Highly active antiretroviral therapy plays a direct role in preserving the immune system, helping to decrease the incidence of ARL. We present a case of a female patient with HIV (CD4 count of 576 cells\/mm3) diagnosed with a stage Ill-B non-Hodgkin lymphoma in 2009 while off HAART. She was subsequently started on HAART, leading to full resolution of her lymphoma without any chemotherapeutic intervention. She was last seen in the clinic in December 2013 without any evidence of recurrence of her lymphoma. To our knowledge, this is the first case report of a stage III-B non-Hodgkin&lt;in lymphoma in an HIV-infected patient, which resolved with only HAART.","487":"Biannual attendance at medical visits is an established measure of retention in HIV care. We examined factors associated with attending at least 2 clinic visits at least 90 days apart among HIV-infected, antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive HIV Outpatient Study participants entering care during 2000 to 2011. Of 1441 patients, 85% were retained in care during the first year of observation. Starting ART during the year was the strongest correlate of retention (adjusted odds ratio [aOR] 6.4, 95% confidence interval [CI] 4.4-9.4). After adjusting for starting ART, publicly insured patients (aOR 0.6, 95% CI 0.4-1.0), and patients with baseline CD4 counts &lt;200 cells\/mm(3) (aOR 0.5, 95% CI 0.3-0.9) or missing CD4 counts (aOR 0.3, 95% CI 0.2-0.6) were less likely to be retained in care. Although most patients had recommended biannual care visits, some ART-naive individuals may require additional interventions to remain in care. Promptly initiating ART may facilitate engagement in care. ","488":"This report describes the HIV-related health care practices and associated support service needs of a sample of HIV-positive incarcerated men in Puerto Rico. Data are derived from a random sample of HIV-positive incarcerated men (n = 37) in Puerto Rico who completed a brief survey. Analysis included descriptive statistics to examine lifetime prevalence of substance use, selected health care practices, receipt of services, and hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. Most men (97.3%) reported history of alcohol or drug use, prior incarceration, and drug use as the main risk factors for HIV infection (73.0%). In all, 83.8% of the men reported having had their first HIV screening test in a correctional facility, 55.6% reported intermittent HIV therapy, and most (83.8%) had also been diagnosed with HCV. Correctional facilities can be important settings for engaging high-risk populations in health care, capturing and enrolling unidentified HIV\/HCV infections for clinical care, and engaging in substance abuse treatment. In order for these public health outcomes to be achieved, it is important to consider strategies to optimize care inside prison and in the community. ","489":"Behavioral interventions have utilized a variety of strategies and components to reduce HIV risk. This article describes the partner intervention, a couple-based group HIV risk reduction intervention implemented in 6 urban community health clinics in Lusaka, Zambia, and examines the components of the intervention and their relationship with condom use. Couple members completed assessments on condom use, acceptability, willingness to use condoms, communication, intimate partner violence (IPV), self-efficacy, and HIV information at baseline and 6 months' follow-up. This study examined the relative impact of elements of the intervention as predictors of condom use. Changes in acceptability had the greatest overall influence on condom use, followed by social support, relationship consensus, and willingness to use condoms. Changes in self-efficacy, IPV, negotiation, and information had no influence. Results support the use of multidimensional approaches in behavioral interventions and highlight the importance of identifying critical elements of interventions to maximize risk reduction outcomes. ","490":"Research has demonstrated that adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) results in lower rates of morbidity and mortality associated with HIV infection, yet adherence remains a challenge in resource-limited settings like the Dominican Republic. Clinica de Familia La Romana addressed this problem with an education-based adherence program for adult patients new to ART, and this retrospective cohort study aimed to evaluate the impact of this intervention. Appointment adherence and biological markers were assessed in cases and controls through 12 months. A total of 101 participants were included, with 61 controls and 40 cases. The baseline CD4 count was 162 and 157 cells\/mm3 in controls and cases, respectively. Cases showed a 15-fold increase in CD4 count compared with a 2.5-fold increase in controls. Cases were more likelyto adhere to appointments with adherence rates of 86% versus 76% in controls. There was no difference between the rates of treatment abandonment, transfer of care, or death.","491":"Rhodococcus equi, previously called Corynebacterium equi, is known to cause pneumonia in foals and swine. Although it was known to cause infection rarely in humans, R equi infection in humans has increased with the advent of HIV and increased use of immunosuppressants. We report a case of a 48-year-old male patient with newly diagnosed HIV\/AIDS presenting with recurrent R equi bacteremia, pericardial effusion, and pericardial cyst. The infection was treated with drainage of the pericardial effusion and cyst and 2 weeks of intravenous vancomycin and 6 months of oral azithromycin and levofloxacin. Rhodococcus equi causes pericarditis and pericardial effusion. It can be effectively treated with debridement, drainage, and a prolonged course of antibiotics. In vitro antibiotic susceptibility should be checked as resistance to antibiotics can develop, especially if drainage is inadequate. ","492":"Despite treatment with potent and effective combination antiretroviral medications, the incidence of non-Hodgkin lymphoma (NHL) in the population living with HIV\/AIDS remains significantly higher than that in noninfected individuals. The majority of the HIV-infected patients with NHL present with advanced stage extranodal disease of the B-cell phenotype. Lymphomas are the second most common tumors involving the heart in HIV-infected patients. Although the heart may serve as the primary focus of the lymphoma, in most HIV-related cases, cardiac lymphomatous involvement is part of a metastatic process that originated elsewhere. ","493":"Coinfection of HIV-1 and cytomegalovirus (CMV) may occur given the shared routes of transmission, and the clinical presentations of each process overlap. We present a case of acute HIV-1 and CMV coinfection presenting with an acute febrile illness complicated by meningitis, hepatitis, and retinopathy. This and other similar cases demonstrate the need to consider CMV coinfection in acute HIV-1 disease, particularly in situations with significant end-organ damage. ","494":"Despite the 2006 U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) recommendations for routine HIV testing in health care settings, many persons remain untested. To determine physician barriers to HIV testing, we surveyed primary care physicians in community health centers in a high HIV prevalence city. Primary care physicians were invited via e-mail to participate in a Web-based survey. One hundred and thirty-seven physicians participated (response rate: 43.9%). Fifty-five physicians (41.0%) were unaware of updated CDC HIV testing recommendations. Physicians were unaware that testing should be routinely offered in primary care settings caring for adolescents (62 physicians, 45.6%) and primary care settings caring for adults (33, 24.3%). Physicians were also unaware that teenage years patients aged 13 to 17 years (68, 49.6%) and adult patients aged 18 to 64 years (40, 29.2%) should be routinely HIV tested. With the new 2013 US Preventive Services Task Force recommendations to support routine HIV testing, it is critical to address ongoing physician HIV testing barriers to mitigate the HIV epidemic. ","495":"In 2006, the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention issued recommendations supporting routine HIV testing in health care settings for all persons aged 13 to 64 years. Despite these recommendations, physicians are not offering HIV testing routinely. We apply a model that has previously identified 3 central, inter-related factors (knowledge-, attitude-, and behavior-related barriers) for why physicians do not follow practice guidelines in order to better understand why physicians are not offering HIV testing routinely. This model frames our review of the existing literature on physician barriers to routine HIV testing. Within the model, knowledge barriers include lack of familiarity or awareness of clinical recommendations, attitude barriers include lack of agreement with guidelines, while behavioral barriers include external barriers related to the guidelines themselves, to patients, or to environmental factors. Our review reveals that many physicians face these barriers with regards to implementing routine HIV testing. Several factors underscore the importance of determining how to best address physician barriers to HIV testing, including: provisions of the Affordable Care Act that are likely to require or incentivize major payers to cover HIV testing, evidence which suggests that a physician's recommendation to test for HIV is a strong predictor of patient testing behavior, and data which reveals that nearly 20% of HIV-positive individuals may be unaware of their status. In April 2013, the US Preventive Services Task Force released a recommendation supporting routine HIV testing; strategies are needed to help address ongoing physician barriers to testing. ","496":"To determine the prevalence of prevention counseling discussions between HIV care providers and their patients who are newly linked to care and to assess factors that facilitate such discussions. In 2009, a probability sample of HIV care providers in 582 outpatient settings in the United States and Puerto Rico was surveyed regarding provider's HIV prevention discussions with HIV-infected patients newly linked to HIV medical care. A majority of providers reported consistently discussing HIV transmission risk reduction (76%), sexually transmitted disease risk (66%), and adherence to antiretroviral regimens (87%). Only 35% of providers reported consistently discussing partner counseling services. The proportion of providers engaged in HIV prevention counseling with patients newly linked to HIV care is generally high, but more work is needed to encourage providers to fully participate as partners in prevention, which is central to preventing onward transmission of HIV. ","497":"Tuberculosis (TB) is one of the most common opportunistic infections that affects patients with HIV. HIV and TB coinfection have a synergistic effect on each other, with one disease worsening the effects and treatment of the other. In the recent past, varying levels of drug resistance are also found in patients coinfected with HIV and TB, but rarely is it reported in children in India. The present case documents partial extensively drug-resistant TB in an 8-year-old child. ","498":"In this discourse analytic article, I discuss the shifting challenges of HIV\/AIDS caregiving, as highlighted in previous research, as well as the similarities between past and present challenges as illustrated by the discourses of HIV\/AIDS caregivers at a nonprofit organization in South Africa. Using data from interviews with staff members and volunteers, I illustrate how both past and contemporary challenges in HIV\/AIDS caregiving relate to an inability to exercise control. Participants' discourses revealed a contrast whereby, on one hand, they conveyed a sense of being in control over HIV, while, contradictorily, their accounts contained instances of lack or loss of control. I discuss the implications of barriers to control in HIV\/AIDS caregiving and the role of communication and interaction research. I conclude by endorsing ongoing, regular assessments of the needs of those undertaking such work in order to identify their evolving needs in light of evolving challenges.","499":null,"500":"This discursive article introduces HIV treatment as prevention (TasP) and identifies various models for its extrapolation to wider population levels. Drawing on HIV surveillance data for Jamaica and Barbados, the article identifies significant gaps in HIV response programming in relation to testing, antiretroviral treatment coverage, and treatment adherence, thereby highlighting the disparity between assumptions and prerequisites for TasP success. These gaps are attributable, in large part, to sociocultural impediments and structural barriers, severe resource constraints, declining political will, and the redefinition of HIV as a manageable, chronic health issue. Antiretroviral treatment and TasP can realize success only within a combination prevention frame that addresses structural factors, including stigma and discrimination, gender inequality and gender-based violence, social inequality, and poverty. The remedicalization of the response compromises outcomes and undermines the continued potential of HIV programming as an entry point for the promotion of sexual, health, and human rights. ","501":"Distal symmetrical peripheral neuropathy (DSPN) and sleep disturbances are among the most common complications reported in people living with the human immunodeficiency virus infection and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (PLWHA). DSPN-pain is predominantly managed by using systemic agents with little evidence supporting their analgesic efficacy. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the effect of nighttime lower extremity splinting application on DSPN-related pain and sleep disturbances compared to a parallel splint liner application in PLWHA. Forty-six PLWHA and DSPN were randomized to nighttime wearing of bilateral lower extremity splints or the liners only. Pain and sleep outcomes were measured at baseline, week 3, and week 6. The pain was measured using the Neuropathic Pain Scale and sleep using the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index. Pain and sleep scores improved in both groups over time. The median percentage pain reduction at week 6 was 8% in the liner group and 34% in the splint group. The change in pain scores in the splint group was found to be significant over time, P &lt; .0005. The contrast between the splint and liner groups was underpowered (26%) and was not found to be significant, P &gt; .05. Sleep scores improved 20% from baseline to the end of the study in both groups; all participants were classified as poor sleepers. The 6-week use of nighttime splints reduces DSPN-pain possibly by providing peripheral inhibition of external stimuli. Future studies are needed to validate this inhibitory intervention to manage DSPN in PLWHA and other neuropathic conditions. ","502":"Eligibility criteria were (I) having previously failed first-line nonnucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitor-based regimens and (2) having achieved virologic suppression &gt;6 months while receiving a protease inhibitor (PI)-based regimen as second-line treatment. Eligible participants were randomized to receive either (I) ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV\/r) monotherapy (n = 29) or (2) LPV\/r with optimized background regimens (OBRs; n = 31). Median duration of viral suppression before randomization was 45 months. At week 48, viral suppression during LPV\/r monotherapy was 86.2% and did not differ from the suppression achieved with LPV\/r with OBRs (87.1%, P = 1.000). However, persistent viremia during LPV\/r monotherapy tended to be higher than during LPV\/r with OBRs (10.3% versus 3.2%, P = .346). History of viral blip during virologic suppression with second-line PI-based regimen is a predictor of achieving viral suppression at all visits (adjusted relative risk 0.255 [95% confidence interval 0.080-0.821], P = .022). Use of LPV\/r monotherapy as maintenance regimen in this study produced persistent viremia that tended to be higher than LPV\/r monotherapy with OBRs.","503":null,"504":null,"505":"Initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) with low CD4 counts or AIDS-defining illnesses (ADIs) increases risk of treatment failure and death. We examined factors associated with late initiation among 18- to 29-year-olds within the Canadian Observational Cohort (CANOC) collaboration, a multi-site study of HIV-positive persons who initiated HAART after 2000. Late initiation was defined as beginning HAART with a CD4 count &lt;200 cells\/mm(3) and\/or having a baseline ADI. Multivariable logistic regression was used to identify independent correlates of late initiation. In total, 1026 individuals (422 from British Columbia, 400 from Ontario, and 204 from Quebec) met our age criteria. At HAART initiation, median age was 27 years (interquartile range, 24, 28 years). A total of 412 individuals (40%) identified as late initiators. Late initiation was associated with female gender, age &gt;25 years at initiation, initiating treatment in earlier years, and having higher baseline viral load. The high number of young adults in our cohort starting HAART late indicates important target populations for specialized services, increased testing, and linkages to care. ","506":"As countries consider a wider use of triple antiretroviral therapy (ART) in pregnancy, which in recent World Health Organization guidelines is called Option B+, this study sought to explore the potential implications of adopting Option B+ by characterizing HIV infection in pregnant women attending 2 semiurban antenatal clinics in Cameroon. In a descriptive cross-sectional study, consenting women were screened for HIV; positive samples were confirmed using an enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay test, and CD4 levels and HIV viral loads were determined using flow cytometry and reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction, respectively. The seroprevalence of HIV in the 407 pregnant women screened was 8.4% (95% confidence interval: 5.9%-11.5%). The majority (82.4%) of HIV-positive women had CD4 counts &gt;350 cells\/mm(3). A quarter (25%) had undetectable viral levels (&lt;80 copies\/mL). Adopting Option B+ in this setting would result in a 5-fold increase in the number of HIV-infected pregnant women being placed on lifelong triple ART.

A broad inventory of the communication disorders was obtained in a convenience sample of 82 adult HIV\/AIDS patients who presented for medical appointments. Each participant underwent a head and neck exam and a communications skills evaluation. Speech, language, and cognition were assessed using a 10-item test battery. A 14-item hearing test battery was conducted in a separate session. The primary outcomes were the presence and degree of communication disorders. Head and neck exams revealed 40% with ear-related issues. Only 2 participants showed normal findings on all 24 communication skills assessments. Four demonstrated normal findings on all speech-language-cognitive assessments, whereas 8 had normal findings on the complete hearing test battery. A relatively high prevalence of cognitive and language deficits and central auditory disturbances were found. Clinicians must recognize the potential for communication deficits even in a relatively healthy patient with HIV. ","508":"Sickle cell disease (SCD) is a genetic disorder resulting from a mutation in the hemoglobin (Hb) gene. Sickle cell disease results in chronic anemia and a variety of acute and chronic complications that can lead to early mortality. A child with both SCD and HIV presents a management challenge, particularly in a resource-limited setting. In this case report, we describe the case of an 18-month-old Kenyan girl with SCD and HIV who developed a severe hypersensitivity reaction to first-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). Selecting an appropriate drug substitute for a child with SCD and HIV presents a management dilemma when the available options have problematic side effect profiles or are inaccessible or inappropriate according to national guidelines. The challenges in choosing an appropriate ART regimen for a child with SCD and HIV highlight the lack of data and scarcity of treatment options for pediatric patients.

We report a case of a 12-year-old girl with facial palsy due to middle cerebral artery infarct because of HIV infection and associated protein C deficiency.","511":"The risk for occupational exposure to HIV is a serious public health problem that is well characterized in the developed world, but less so in the developing countries such as Ghana. This study was undertaken to examine the characteristics of occupational exposure to HIV and the utilization of a risk assessment system (RAS)-based postexposure prophylaxis (PEP) among health care workers (HCWs) and health care students (HCSs) in the Korle-Bu Teaching Hospital (KBTH). During the study period (January 2005-December 2010), a total of 260 and 35 exposures were reported by HCWs and HCSs, respectively. Ward attendants reported the highest incidence rate of 6.46 of 100 person-years (P-Y). The incidence of high-risk exposures was 0.33 of 100 P-Y (n = 65); 60.0% occurred during a procedure of disposing of a needle and 24.6% during a cannula insertion. A total of 289 of the 295 individuals were administered PEP, of which 181 (62.6%) completed the 6-month follow-up testing schedule and none sero-converted. This shows that with a good RAS in place, it is possible to deploy an effective PEP program in a typical African teaching hospital like the KBTH in Accra, Ghana.

Cross-sectional, observational study; an interview questionnaire technique was used with the managers and the residents of the AWHs. A total of 7 AWHs and 96 residents were included; 32% of the staff were health care workers and 45.5% volunteers. The occupancy rate was 86% (2007) and 96% (2008). Residents' characteristics: mean age 45.6 years, 73% male, 92% with at least 1 AIDS-defining disease, median Karnofsky index 60 (50-80), and median Barthel index 80 (40-100). Half the residents had physical sequelae and 31% mental sequelae. The AWHs perform an important role in the care of certain types of patients with HIV infection. They require human and material resources to be able to tackle the immense difficulties associated with this group of patients. ","513":"Voluntary medical male circumcision (VMMC) is being suggested as an essential HIV prevention strategy in high-prevalence areas. These analyses reflect data collected from 360 married couples, 50% of which included a circumcised husband and the other 50% uncircumcised, in rural Malawi. Regardless of their circumcision status, men were more likely to perceive that being circumcised was less painful than having a tooth pulled, giving birth, and having malaria. Men reported having the same sexual pleasure regardless of the circumcision status, while women were 2.0 times more likely to report greater sexual pleasure with a circumcised partner. Participants identified the medical benefits of VMMC and highlighted the potential personal benefits of VMMC. As VMMC has become a promising method of HIV prevention, this study revealed opportunities for intervention development to increase rates of VMMC among men.","514":"Sexually transmitted infections (STIs) significantly increase HIV transmission. Sexually transmitted infections may be asymptomatic and therefore remain undiagnosed in HIV-positive persons. Routine screening and treatment of STIs in HIV-positive high-risk populations in sub-Saharan Africa have not been described previously. We reviewed data from an HIV-positive high-risk population at the Infectious Diseases Institute, Makerere University, a large urban HIV clinic, between July 2011 and April 2012. Our high-risk population cohort included female sex workers, long-distance drivers, barmaids, taxi drivers, commercial motorcycle \"boda-boda\" riders, soldiers, police officers, prison officers, security guards, prisoners, and fishermen. Of 355 participants enrolled in the high-risk population's program, 21.4% were diagnosed with an STI either clinically or microbiologically. The STIs diagnosed in this population were syphilis, hepatitis B, genital herpes, human papilloma virus infection (condylomata acuminata), nongonococcal urethritis (NGU), and gonorrhea. Rates of syphilis, hepatitis B, genital herpes, condylomata acuminata, NGU, and gonorrhea were 8.5%, 7.0%, 5.4%, 1.4%, 1.4%, and 0.3%, respectively. Clinical and microbiologically diagnosed STIs were diagnosed in nearly one-fourth of the HIV-positive high-risk population. HIV care programs should note our high rates of STIs among HIV-positive high-risk populations and consider routine screening and treatment algorithms for these populations in their own settings. ","515":"Published data addressing the effectiveness of darunavir-ritonavir (DRV\/r)-based therapy for multiexperienced patients in developing countries are scarce. This study evaluated the 48-week virologic and immunologic effectiveness of salvage therapy based on DRV\/r for the treatment of multidrug-experienced HIV-1-infected adults in Brazil. A multicenter retrospective cohort study was carried out with multidrug-experienced adults who were on a failing antiretroviral therapy and started a DRV\/r-based salvage therapy between 2008 and 2010. The primary effectiveness end point was the proportion of patients with virologic success (plasma HIV-1 RNA &lt;50 copies\/mL at week 48). At 48 weeks, 73% of the patients had HIV-RNA &lt;50 copies\/mL and a mean increase of 108 CD4 cells\/mm(3). Higher baseline viral load, lower baseline CD4 count, younger age, and 3 or more DRV\/r-associated resistance mutations were significantly predictive of virologic failure. Concomitant use of raltegravir was strongly associated with virologic success. The use of DRV\/r-based regimens for salvage therapy is an effective strategy in the clinical care setting of a developing country. ","516":"Studies have identified several programmatic and nonprogrammatic indicators that affect adherence to highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Depression has been shown to impact adherence to HAART. This cross-sectional analysis of data collected from Nigeria, Uganda, Zambia, and Tanzania in 2008 examined the relationship between levels of depressive symptoms, clinical progression, and adherence to HAART. A multinational, multicenter, observational, retrospective cross-sectional evaluation of a population of focus comprised randomly selected patients on HAART. The dependent variable was adherence to HAART. The primary variable of interest to be assessed was patients' level of depressive symptom score. A multivariable logistic regression model was used to examine the relationship between explanatory variables and adherence to HAART. A total of 2344 patients were recruited for adherence survey. About 70% of the study sample reported having some level of depression. Logistic regression results show that patients who reported, respectively, low, moderate, and high levels of depressive symptoms are 35% (P &lt; .001), 56% (P &lt; .001), and 64% (P &lt; .001) less likely to adhere to HAART than those who reported having no depressive symptoms. At multivariate analysis, adherence to HAART was independently associated with the levels of depressive symptoms, older age, CD4 count &gt;200 cells\/mm3, Truvada (tenofovir [TDF]\/emtricitabine [FTC])-based regimens, good knowledge about HAART, and longer period on therapy. These results indicate that mental health and clinical parameters are significant factors in determining patients' adherence to their HAART, which need to be more aggressively addressed as a critical component of care and treatment support.

A retrospective cohort analysis was performed to describe the characteristics and outcome in 35 parent-child pairs taking antiretroviral therapy (ART) in separate adult and pediatric HIV clinics. In 26 pairs, ART was first initiated in children. Baseline median CD4 count was 122\/mm(3) in adults and 376\/mm(3) in children. World Health Organization stage 3 or 4 disease affected 49% of adults and 83% of children. In all, 3 parents and 1 child died. Hospitalization, poor adherence, missed appointments, or regimen change affected &gt;50% of pairs on ART. Following tuberculosis diagnosis in their parents, 2 of the 5 children were not investigated. By week 104, 29 (83%) pairs remained on ART, and 69% of patients on ART were virologically suppressed. Parent-child pairs with advanced HIV infection had good outcomes when cared for in separate clinics. Establishing lines of communication between clinics is important.

Cases and controls were selected from HIV-positive patients, aged 18 years and older, on antiretroviral therapy (ART) at the Infectious Diseases Clinic (IDC) in January 2008. As cases, we selected 209 patients who in 2008 did not return to the clinic within 90 days of their scheduled appointment date. As controls, we randomly selected 626 patients from the 5872 patients who were following up at the end of December 2008. In multivariable logistic regression analysis, urban or semiurban residence, World Health Organization disease stage III or IV at ART initiation, a median CD4 count at last visit &lt;200 cells\/mm(3), tuberculosis (TB) in the 6 months before the last visit, absence of counseling before ART initiation, and no disclosure of HIV status were associated with LTFU. This study demonstrates the importance of close patient monitoring in advanced stages of disease, supportive counseling for patients initiating ART, extra psychosocial support for patients with TB and HIV coinfection, assisting patients with disclosure, and setting up a good referral system to retain patients on ART.

All children diagnosed to have TAHI at the University College Hospital, Ibadan, were studied and compared with children who acquired HIV vertically using the pediatric HIV database in the hospital. Transfusion-associated HIV infection accounted for 14 (2.3%) of the 597 children diagnosed to have HIV infection between January 2004 and December 2011. The mean age at diagnosis of TAHI was 10.2 years and that of vertically acquired HIV infection was 3.9 years ( P &lt; .001). In 9 cases, blood transfusion took place in private hospitals and in 5 cases in public hospitals. Median interval between infection and diagnosis of AIDS was 84 months in cases with TAHI and 48 months in vertically acquired cases ( P = .542). Optimal blood safety practices are advocated for prevention of TAHI in Nigeria. ","524":null,"525":"The success of antiretroviral therapy (ART) programs in the developing world is limited by the lack of adequate diagnostic tests to screen for life-threatening opportunistic infections such as tuberculosis (TB) and cryptococcal disease. Furthermore, there is an increasing need for implementation research in measuring the effectiveness of currently available rapid diagnostic tests. The recently developed lateral flow assays for both cryptococcal disease and TB have the potential to improve care and greatly reduce the time to initiation of ART among individuals who need it the most. However, we caution that the data on feasibility and effectiveness of these assays are limited and such research agendas must be prioritized. ","526":"Previous research has studied the rate of hepatitis C virus (HCV) coinfection among HIV-positive people regardless of their antiretroviral therapy (ART) status. Our objectives were to measure the seroprevalence of HCV both in HIV-positive people receiving ART and in those not receiving ART and to describe the characteristics of coinfected people in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. We conducted a cross-sectional survey of 319 HIV-positive people residing in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. We screened the participants' serum samples for HCV antibodies using the Latex Photometric Immunoassay based on third-generation assay. A total of 138 (43.3%) participants were HCV positive. The prevalence of HCV coinfection was 96.2% (125 of 130) among participants with lifetime injection drug use (IDU). Among participants not receiving ART, the coinfection rate was 58.1% (50 of 86) compared with 37.8% (88 of 233) among those receiving ART. In multivariable analysis, participants who reported lifetime IDU and were current smokers were more likely to have HCV coinfection. The adjusted odds ratio (AOR) of HCV coinfection for ART was decreased, although it was not statistically significant (AOR = 0.45; 95% confidence interval = 0.13-1.48). The high prevalence of HCV coinfection among both individuals receiving ART and those not receiving ART suggests that screening for HCV among HIV-positive people would be useful, in particular, for those with lifetime IDU and soon after their HIV diagnosis. ","527":"Nigeria has the world's highest burden of pediatric HIV. In the face of paucity of monitoring tests in Nigeria, we studied the spectrum of pediatric mucocutaneous manifestations and evaluated their clinical utility as surrogate markers for immunodeficiency and plasma viral load levels. Cross-sectional study comparing mucocutaneous manifestations in 155 HIV-positive children aged 12 weeks to 14 years with 155 HIV-negative children. Relationships between mucocutaneous manifestations in HIV-infected patients and their immunologic and virologic indices were analyzed. Mucocutaneous lesions were seen in 53.5% of HIV-infected children compared with 18.1% of the controls. Prevalence of lesions increased with worsening levels of immunodeficiency and increasing viral loads (P &lt; .01). Oral candidiasis, angular stomatitis, and fluffy hair were associated with more severe degrees of immunodeficiency. Mucocutaneous disorders are common in HIV-infected children. Oral candidiasis and nutritional dermatoses can be used as surrogates for advanced or severe immunodeficiency. ","528":"Thrombocytopenia is frequently encountered in HIV-infected patients, and the predominant cause is primary HIV-associated thrombocytopenia (PHAT). Standard treatment regimens include optimization of antiretroviral therapy, intravenous immunoglobulin, anti-D, and corticosteroids. Retreatment due to the inability to sustain remission or inferior responses is common, and investigation into the safety and efficacy of alternative therapies is warranted. We describe novel and effective treatment of PHAT with the peptide thrombopoietin receptor agonist romiplostim in a patient with a minimal response to conventional therapy. ","529":"The impact of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) on the epidemiology of AIDS-associated histoplasmosis in the past decade is poorly defined. Among 100 patients with histoplasmosis in an endemic region between 2000 and 2009, 42 patients were immunocompetent, 32 were infected with HIV, and 26 were non-HIV-immunocompromised patients. The percentage with HIV decreased 67% in 2000-2001 to 18% in 2008-2009 (P = .004), while the proportion of non-HIV immunocompromised patients increased, 8% to 41% (P = .14). Histoplasma antigen was the most sensitive test (73%), whereas potassium hydroxide examination of clinical specimens was the least sensitive test (33%) in all 3 groups. Bronchoalveloar fluid culture (74%) had the highest yield among the cultures. The relapse rate was higher in HIV-infected patients compared to the other 2 groups (P = .04). The epidemiology of histoplasmosis in our endemic area has changed during the era of HAART. Organ transplantation and increasing use of immunosuppressive agents for chronic inflammatory conditions in non-HIV patients now account for most of the cases of histoplasmosis. ","530":"In India, a zidovudine-based regimen is preferred as the first-line drug treatment for HIV, despite high rates of drug toxicity. This study estimates the treatment costs for HIV. Eligible patients were enrolled from Antiretroviral Therapy Center, Christian Medical College, India. Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics, medical and nonmedical expenditure, and lost income were collected. Of 41 patients enrolled and followed for 6 months, HIV treatment toxicity and opportunistic infections were reported by 12 (29%) and 13 (31.7%) patients, respectively. The median total costs, direct costs, and out-of-pocket expenditure were Indian rupees (INR) 9418 (US$181), 8727 (US$168), and 7157 (US$138), respectively. Diagnostic tests accounted for 58% of the expenses. HIV treatment accounted for 34% of the median income earned INR 21 000 (US$404). Expenditure for treatment with toxicity was 44% higher than without toxicity. Current treatment is associated with toxicity, increasing treatment costs and imposing a significant economic burden. ","531":"Cryptococcal meningitis (CM) remains a significant HIV-associated opportunistic infection in Southeast Asia and Africa, with a high burden of disease and a high mortality rate despite the availability of antiretroviral therapy (ART). We retrospectively examined the utility of cryptococcal antigen screening to identify risk for CM among 211 Thai women initiating ART. Antigenemia prevalence was 11% (n = 9) among 84 women with a CD4 count &lt;100 cells\/mm(3). Screening identified all women who later developed CM. Cryptococcal antigen titers decreased over time with ART. Our study confirmed findings from previous studies in Thailand and South Africa and provided novel observational data regarding the course of cryptococcal antigenemia in patients initiating ART and the poor efficacy of low-dose fluconazole prophylaxis in preventing CM among patients with antigenemia.","532":"We followed 205 HIV-infected adults on antiretroviral therapy for at least 12 weeks in a Gambian clinic, where routine viral load monitoring was performed. The 1- and 4-week self-reported adherence and timeliness in keeping to scheduled appointments were recorded at each visit. Seventy patients had measurable viremia between the 12th week and the 3rd year of therapy. Survival analysis of the first detectable viral load on therapy demonstrated an association with 4-week (hazard ratio [HR] 2.6, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.5-4.3, P=.001) and 1-week (HR 1.9, 95% CI 1.1-3.3, P=.024) self-reported suboptimal adherence and with 1 to 15 days of late presentation for appointments (HR 1.6-1.8, P .027-.109). In a multiple regression model, only 4-week self-reported adherence remained as a significant predictor of viremia.","533":"Access to parks improves overall health outcomes in the general population. Given that HIV infection has become a chronic disease to manage, among populations engaged in medical care, parks may be promoted as physical activity opportunities in order to manage chronic comorbid conditions. We conducted a cross-sectional examination of the relationships between sociodemographic and biomedical characteristics to park proximity among 635 individuals receiving outpatient HIV care. The data collected included HIV-related biomarkers, depression, and diagnoses of other chronic diseases. The total acres of parks an individual is exposed within one-quarter mile from their home were assessed. The cohort included 635 individuals (67% men, 73% black, and 21% white, mean age 42 years). Unemployment was negatively associated with park availability. Park proximity was not associated with depression or HIV biomarkers. As yet, little effort has been committed to promoting park usage as a low-cost, sustainable method to addressing comorbidities among individuals with HIV. ","534":"We tested a couples HIV testing and counseling (CHTC) intervention with male couples in Atlanta by randomizing eligible couples to receive either CHTC or separate individual voluntary HIV counseling and testing (iVCT). To evaluate the acceptability and safety of CHTC, main outcomes were satisfaction with the intervention and the proportions of couples reporting intimate partner violence (IPV) and relationship dissolution after the service. The results indicated that the service was very acceptable to men (median 7-item index of satisfaction was 34 for CHTC and 35 for iVCT, P = .4). There was no difference in either incident IPV (22% versus 17% for CHTC and iVCT, respectively, P = .6) or relationship dissolution (42% versus 51% for CHTC and iVCT, respectively, P = .5). Based on the preliminary data, CHTC is safe for male couples, and it is equally acceptable to iVCT for men who have main partners. ","535":"Tuberculosis (TB) remains the most common cause of death in people living with HIV\/AIDS. The aim of the present study was to identify predictors of mortality in TB\/HIV-coinfected patients. We conducted an unmatched case-control study among a cohort of TB\/HIV-coinfected adults who were on antiretroviral therapy (ART). Cases comprised 69 TB\/HIV-coinfected patients who died during this period. For each case, we selected 3 (207) TB\/HIV-coinfected patients who were alive during the end of the follow-up period. Male sex (odds ratio [OR] = 2.04, 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.04-4.02), being bedridden at enrollment (OR = 2.84, 95% CI: 1.17-6.89), and cough of more than 2 weeks during initiation of ART (OR = 4.75 95% CI: 2.14-10.56) were the best predictors of mortality among TB\/HIV-coinfected patients. Mortality among TB\/HIV-coinfected patients accounted for a considerable number of deaths among the cohort. Patients with cough at ART initiation and with poor functional status should be strictly followed to reduce death. ","536":"Toxoplasma encephalitis (TE) is the most common cause of focal deficits in patients living with HIV\/AIDS. Among 257 HIV-infected adult patients seen between January 2006 and December 2010 in a tertiary hospital in Zaria, northern Nigeria, 9 (3.5%) patients had clinical, serological, and brain imaging evidence of TE. All 9 patients had CD4 count of less than 50 cells\/mm(3). Of the 9 patients, 7 were antiretroviral therapy (ART)-naive, while 2 were cases of ART-induced TE-immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome. After administering intravenous dexamethasone for cerebral decompression and specific antitoxoplasma therapy, symptoms and signs resolved in 8 patients within 4 to 14 days, but 1 patient died. Our data suggest that even in the ART era in Nigeria, TE remains a fairly common cause of morbidity among HIV-infected patients due to late HIV diagnosis and significant immunosuppression at diagnosis. Early HIV diagnosis, early initiation of highly active ART, and routine prophylaxis against TE are imperative in combating the challenge of HIV\/AIDS-related TE in Nigeria. ","537":"This is a retrospective cohort study of 352 newly diagnosed HIV-infected individuals in Denver, from 2005 to 2007. Utilizing data from 3 health care systems, 2 clinical trials units, and statewide Colorado HIV laboratory reporting databases, we tracked initial linkage to HIV care, retention in care, loss to follow-up, and transitions between HIV care providers. After more than 2.6 years of follow-up, 256 (73%) individuals linked to HIV care within 180 days. Of the 301 individuals who eventually linked to care, 168 (56%) had at least one 180-day gap in care, while 49 (16%) had a 360-day gap. Transitions in care were common, with 131 (37%) individuals accessing care from 2 different providers and 15% having evidence of living outside of Colorado. In this newly diagnosed HIV-infected cohort, linkage to care was slow and long-term retention in care was poor. Transitions between HIV care providers were common and may impair engagement in care over time. Out-of-state migration was frequent and may cause an underestimation of engagement in care. ","538":"We determined the proportion and correlates of self-reported pregnancy planning discussions (that is preconception counseling) that HIV-positive women reported to their family physicians (FPs), HIV specialists, and obstetrician\/gynecologists (OB\/Gyns). In a cross-sectional substudy, HIV-positive women of reproductive potential were asked whether their care providers discussed pregnancy planning. Logistic regression was used to calculate odds ratios for the correlates of preconception counseling. A total of 431 eligible participants (median age 38, interquartile range = 32-43) reported having discussion with a physician (92% FP, 96% HIV specialists, and 45% OB\/Gyns). In all, 34%, 41%, and 38% had their pregnancy planning discussion with FP, HIV specialist, and Ob\/Gyns, respectively; 51% overall. In the multivariable model, significant correlates of preconception counseling were age (P = .02), marital status (P &lt; .01), number of years living in Canada (P &lt; .001), and age of youngest child (P &lt; .01). Preconception care in our cohort was suboptimal. We recommend that counseling on healthy preconception should be part of routine HIV care. ","539":"Pain, sleep, and functional disturbances are a common occurrence in people living with HIV\/AIDS-related distal sensory peripheral neuropathy (PLWHA-DSPN) yet lack group classification and quantification. A total of 46 PLWHA-DSPN were recruited, as part of a 2-group intervention study, to complete the Neuropathic Pain Scale and the Pittsburgh Sleep Quality Index (PSQI) questionnaires. The participant's performance during a forward reach task and walking distance in 6 minutes was recorded as a measure of function. The pain (60.77 +\/- 17.85) and sleep (14.62 +\/- 4.28) scores denote marked pain and sleep disturbances, compared to seronegative, age-matched individuals. The ambulation distance was limited (243.99 +\/- 141.04 m) and inversely associated with the PSQI-sleep efficiency subscale (rs = -.35, P &lt; .05). The average reaching distances measured (36.07 +\/- 7.37 cm) were similar to seronegative, age-matched individuals. Pain, sleep, and functional measures exhibited significant associations. The data collected suggest that PLWHA-DSPN report moderate-to-severe pain and significant sleep disturbances and exhibit limited ambulation distances. ","540":"To evaluate the trends in abacavir (ABC) prescription among antiretroviral (ARV) medication-naive individuals following the presentation of the Data Collection on Adverse Events of Anti-HIV Drugs (DAD) cohort study. We conducted a retrospective cohort study of ARV medication-naive individuals in the Canadian Observational Cohort (CANOC). Between January 1, 2000, and February 28, 2010, a total of 7280 ARV medication-naive patients were included in CANOC. We observed a significant change in the proportion of new ABC prescriptions immediately following the release of DAD (-11%; 95% confidence interval [CI]: -20% to -2.4%) and in the months following the presentation of these data (-0.66% per month; 95% CI: -1.2% to -0.073%). A post-DAD presentation decrease in the odds of being prescribed ABC versus tenofovir (TDF) was observed (adjusted odds ratio, 0.72 per year, 95% CI: 0.54-0.97). Presentation of the DAD was associated with a significant decrease in ABC use among ARV medication-naive, HIV-positive patients initiating therapy. ","541":"Alcohol use is common among people with HIV, and beliefs about alcohol interactions with medications predict decreased medication adherence, risking drug-resistant mutations. Maraviroc is an HIV entry inhibitor approved for treatment of both drug-sensitive and drug-resistant HIV strains. The present study evaluated the effects of alcohol on maraviroc pharmacokinetics and the effects of maraviroc on alcohol pharmacokinetics. Ten healthy adults completed alcohol (1 g\/kg) and placebo alcohol pharmacokinetics sessions before and after 7 days of maraviroc administration. Alcohol concentrations increased 12% following maraviroc. Maraviroc pharmacokinetics were unaffected by alcohol. Maraviroc treatment should not be interrupted if alcohol is consumed. ","542":"Postnatal depression (PND) is a major problem in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs). A total of 210 postpartum mothers attending primary care urban clinics were screened for PND at 6 weeks postpartum using the Edinburgh Postnatal Depression Scale (EPDS) and Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders (Fourth Edition; DSM-IV) criteria for major depression. The HIV prevalence was 14.8%. Of the 210 enrolled postpartum mothers, 64 (33%) met DSM IV criteria for depression. Using trained peer coun- selors, mothers with PND (n = 58) were randomly assigned to either group problem-solving therapy (PST, n = 30) or amitriptyline (n = 28). Of the 58 mothers with PND, 49 (85%) completed 6 weeks of group PST (n = 27) or pharmacotherapy (n = 22). At baseline, the mean EPDS score for participants randomized to group PST was 17.3 (standard deviation [SD] 3.7), while the group randomized to amitriptyline had a mean EPDS score of 17.9 (SD 3.9; P = .581). At 6 weeks postintervention, the drop in mean EPDS score was greater in the PST group (8.22, SD 3.6) compared to the amitriptyline group (10.7, SD 2.7; P = .0097). Group PST using peer counselors is feasible, acceptable, and more effective compared to pharmacotherapy in the treatment of PND. Group PST could be integrated into maternal and child health clinics and preventing mother-to-child transmission of HIV programs in LMICs.","543":null,"544":"HIV care providers in the United States must counsel clients about disclosure to sexual partners and report anyone who is suspected of noncompliance. This study compared provider attitudes and practices in relation to counseling clients about mandatory disclosure in North Carolina and Alabama, the 2 states with similar HIV epidemiology but different laws for HIV control. Personal interviews were conducted with 20 providers in each state (n = 40). The results were analyzed in a qualitative, cross-comparison method to identify patterns of convergence or difference. Providers in both states believed that clients often failed to notify sexual partners and were secretive if questioned about disclosure. Differences in counseling styles and procedures for each state were noteworthy. Compared to Alabama, North Carolina had harsher penalties for nondisclosure, stricter and more standardized procedures for counseling, and providers expressed greater support for HIV criminalization. Although most North Carolina providers viewed the stricter standards as beneficial for HIV care and control, Alabama providers were likely to view such standards as a barrier to patient care. These results indicated a direct relation between state HIV law, provider attitudes, and counseling procedures for mandatory disclosure.","545":null,"546":null,"547":"","548":"HIV infection has changed the scenario of infectious disease. HIV-associated immunodeficiency resulted in a wide spectrum of new opportunistic infections. After introduction of antiretroviral therapy (ART), immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) became an important challenge in management of 10% to 25% of the patients. Meta-analyses of IRIS from various reports published worldwide by Monika Muller et al described 12% IRIS incidence and 15.7% IRIS tuberculosis. Among IRIS tuberculosis, central nervous system involvement with IRIS tuberculous meningitis forms only 7%. Only 9 cases of tuberculous brain abscess is reported in patients with AIDS so far.

He gave a history of solitary unprotected extramarital sexual contact 6 months before onset of the rash. Dermatological examination revealed a bilaterally symmetrical, maculopapular erythematous rash involving the palms, forearms, and neck. He showed a positive sign of Buschke-Ollendorff. In the meanwhile, the CD4 count had improved to 196 cells\/mm(3) from the previous count of 92 cells\/mm(3) and the viral load had decreased. Serum venereal disease research laboratory (VDRL) test was reactor at 1:64. He was found to be positive result for treponema pallidum hemagglutination test. Skin biopsy revealed features of secondary syphilis. The rash responded well to a single injection of benzathine penicillin, resulting in the lowering of the VDRL titers.

Kit performances were recorded after the reference techniques (enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay). The following RDTs showed a sensitivity of 100% and a specificity higher than 99%: Determine, Oraquick, SD Bioline, BCP, and Stat-Pak. These kits were used to establish infection screening strategies. The combination with 2 or 3 of these tests in series or parallel algorithms showed that series combinations with 2 tests (Oraquick and Bioline) and 3 tests (Determine, BCP, and Stat-Pak) gave the best performances (sensitivity, specificity, positive predictive value, and negative predictive value of 100%). However, the combination with 2 tests appeared to be more onerous than the combination with 3 tests.

","551":"The article reports on the aspects of a Botswana Ministry of Education and Skills Development (MoE &amp; SD) HIV\/AIDS Instructional Television (ITV) project modeled on a similar HIV\/AIDS program implemented in Brazil. This Teacher Capacity Building Project (TCBP) in Botswana is in its initial years of implementation. Its overall goal is to contribute to the prevention and mitigation of the impact of HIV and AIDS by strengthening the capacity of the education and communication sectors to deliver interactive, distance HIV\/AIDS education primarily to teachers so that they act as agents of behavior change among the in-school youth. One of the components of the TCBP program is a live teacher education television HIV\/AIDS program called Talk Back program. Talk Back is a collaborative effort of the MoE &amp; SD and the Botswana national television station. The Talk Back program involves development and implementation of weekly 1 hour live HIV\/AIDS education interactive TV broadcasts for teachers. The development of the live programs is guided by a curriculum that provides a wide range of themes related to HIV\/AIDS and education. This article reports the results of a survey of a sample of teachers and students at junior secondary schools and senior secondary schools, first, on their views and opinions regarding the Talk Back program as a TCBP. Second, how Setswana cultural beliefs, myths, and practices on sexuality affect teachers' and adolescents' sexual decisions, practices, and experiences as well as HIV\/AIDS and sexually transmitted infection prevention. A questionnaire survey and focus group interviews were used as data collection instruments in selected secondary schools. The findings of the study suggest that the Talk Back program has not met much success as a TCBP. The findings further suggest that several myths, beliefs, misconceptions, and attitudes about HIV\/AIDS exist among Botswana teachers and students and thus make it difficult for the Talk Back program to impart the HIV\/AIDS message successfully. Therefore, there is a need for more stakeholders in HIV\/AIDS education, where appropriate learning techniques are used, to bring about the desired behavioral change.

Participants were randomized to a 3-month group intervention or an individual-enhanced standard-of-care condition and assessed over 6 months. Individual assessment at baseline, 3, and 6 months was done; interviews included lifetime history of problematic alcohol use. A total of 80 HIV-positive individuals on ART were recruited. In all, 35% of participants reported a history of problematic alcohol use, 37% had a detectable viral load, 55% were nonadherent, and 24% reporting skipping medication in the previous 3 months. There was no association between a history of problematic use and an adherence at any time point, that is, at baseline (t = -.7, P = .47), midpoint (t = -.39, P = .69), and 6-month follow-up (t = -1.2, P = .23).

Among HIV\/HBV-coinfected women, the authors observed similar rates of antiretroviral-associated liver toxicity (despite nevirapine [NVP] use) and CD4 count reconstitution as observed in HIV-monoinfected women. Hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) screening detected the majority (81%) of HBV coinfections, including all 5 HBV-coinfected women who did not suppress HBV despite 48 weeks of lamivudine (3TC)-containing ART and could be used to tailor ART for patients diagnosed with HBV coinfection in accordance with World Health Organization guidelines. Although HBsAg screening did not diagnose 5 occult HBV coinfections, these women achieved HBV suppression on 3TC-containing ART, suggesting that not detecting occult HBV coinfection would have limited clinical impact.

Systemic random sampling technique was used in recruiting respondents for the study. The Dermatology Life Quality Index (DLQI) was used to gauge the quality-of-life impairments. The study showed high prevalence of cutaneous lesions in HIV\/AIDS-infected patients. Majority of the respondents (83.7%) scored more than 10 in DLQI score. This signifies that the skin lesions had large negative effects on their quality of life. The assessment of the impact of dermatoses on patients' quality of life is important for clinical management. It is pertinent to detect patients at higher risk of experiencing worse quality of life in order to treat them holistically.","562":"It is unclear whether HIV-related factors modify risk of hypertension (HTN). In a cohort of patients with AIDS, the authors determined HTN incidence and prevalence and assessed associated traditional, HIV-specific, and retinal vasculature factors. Prospective observational cohort included 2390 patients with AIDS (1998-2011). Univariate analysis was used to assess the impact of traditional- and AIDS-related risk factors for HTN prevalence and incidence. Multivariate regression analyses were used to evaluate the adjusted impact of these factors. Hypertension prevalence was 22%(95% confidence interval [CI] 21%-24%) and was associated with traditional HTN risk factors (age, black race, and higher weight) as well as diabetes, hyperlipidemia, time since AIDS diagnosis, and higher CD4 counts. Hypertension incidence was 64.1 per 1000 person-years (95% CI 58.7\/1000-69.9\/1000). Age, race, weight, and diabetes were associated with incident HTN but HIV-specific factors were not. Hypertension, a prevalent cardiovascular risk factor in patients with AIDS, is associated with traditional and metabolic risk factors. ","563":"Early use of highly active antiretroviral treatment (ART) in people living with HIV for HIV prevention has gained legitimacy but remains controversial. Nineteen French HIV experts with diverse specializations (over half of whom were clinicians) were qualitatively interviewed on their views about ART irrespective of CD4 count of more than 500 cells\/mm3 for purposes of HIV prevention, which is not systematically recommended in France. Content analysis identified 2 broad categories: individual considerations (subcategories: patient health and well-being; patient preparedness and choice) and collective considerations (subcategories:HIV transmission risk; impact on the epidemic; cost). Uncertainty surrounded many experts' considerations, and unity was lacking on key issues (eg, candidacy for early preventive treatment, expected clinical- and population-level effects). An umbrella theme labeled \"Weighing the merits of early ART in the face of uncertainties was identified. Our analyses raise doubts about the current acceptability of widespread implementation of early ART for HIV prevention in France.","564":"The purpose of this study was to evaluate how poor retention in HIV care impacts time to viral suppression after initiating highly active antiretroviral therapy. A retrospective cohort study design, employing a medical chart review, was conducted at an academic infectious disease clinic at the University of Kentucky. Patients seeking care between 2003 and 2011 were included in the study. A log-normal model was employed to determine the factors associated with time to viral suppression. Of the 532 patients in the study, 426 (80.1%) patients were virally suppressed. Controlling for insurance status, race, baseline CD4 counts, and viral loads, the expected time to viral suppression for non optimal retainers was longer compared to optimal retainers (100% retained in care; time ratio: 2.04; 95% confidence interval: 1.40-2.90). Researchers should continue to study the impact of retention on clinical outcomes and strategies to improve retention and reengage those lost to follow-up back into care. ","565":"Difficulties in systematically monitoring HIV viral load in resource-limited settings prompt the search for alternate approaches. The authors aimed at assessing the correlation between the plasma levels of soluble forms of Fas receptors (Fas) and Fas ligands (FasL) with standard indicators of HIV disease progression in children. Twenty-two HIV-1-positive children were enrolled in Yaounde. CD4 counts, CD4% counts, plasma levels of Fas, FasL, and HIV-1 RNA levels were assayed. The correlation coefficients (P values) between FasL levels and each of HIV-1 viral load, CD4 counts, and CD4% were, respectively, .56 (.01), -.29 (.18), and .30 (.18). On the other hand, the respective correlation coefficients (P values) with Fas levels were .12 (.60), -.30 (.18), and -.29 (.19). The significant correlation between levels of HIV-1 viral load and FasL suggests that the latter needs to be further studied as a potential biomarker to monitor HIV-1 disease progression in children in resource-limited setting. ","566":"The purpose of this study was to assess patients' experience and satisfaction with pharmacy-only refill program (PRP) and to compare those who were removed from the PRP with those still in the program. A sample of 446 patients was selected from 1503 patients on antiretroviral therapy that had been enrolled in the PRP for at least 24 months. The study used interviewer-administered questionnaires to assess patients' experience and satisfaction with PRP. Of the 446 patients, 133 (29.8%) were removed from the PRP. By multivariate analysis, it was found that wanting to see a clinician before their scheduled clinic visit, Christian religion, and not understanding why they were enrolled in PRP were associated with having been removed from the PRP. Patients felt that the greatest benefit from the program was the time that they saved to do other activities. Patients preferred to collect their medication every 3 months instead of every month. All patients interviewed scored the program high, and all recommended that the PRP should continue. Stable patients prefer to see clinicians less frequently and visit clinic less often.

In this short communication, we describe the impact of an airborne outreach program to provide HIV services to high-HIV burden health facilities in rural Botswana. The analysis demonstrates how this HIV-funded program enhanced access to essential subspecialist services at several rural health facilities across Botswana. ","569":"Little is known about HIV-infected patients with serum testosterone levels in high normal to elevated ranges. An HIV-infected patient with hepatitis C and unexplained high serum testosterone levels prompted a retrospective chart review into the association of hepatitis C and serum testosterone levels greater than 1000 ng\/mL in our clinic. The charts of 1419 male HIV patients were reviewed. Out of 1419 patients, 159 (11%) met the criteria for data analysis. A total of 8 patients had serum testosterone levels greater than 1000 ng\/mL. There was no significant correlation between hepatitis C antibody positivity or presence of hepatitis C viremia as measured by viral load, nor was there any significant correlation with CD4+ cell counts. We found a weak positive association between years since reported diagnosis of HIV and high testosterone levels. ","570":"Many US HIV-positive patients are unaware of their infection. Although there are multiple studies assessing the acceptance of testing, there are none that assess the patient's expectations of routine HIV testing. Through a prospective, cross-sectional, unfunded, convenience sample survey, we assessed the patient's expectation of testing at a regional medical center serving an indigent population. Also, we compared the providers' predictions of the proportion of patients expecting a test. Of the 69 patients, 23% expected a test. The only factor that correlated with this was their desire to be tested (P = .004). Providers' (N = 59) mean prediction was that 21% of the patients expected a test (range: 0%-100%). The proportion of emergency department (ED) patients wanting a test was 52% (of 30) and internal medicine inpatients were 44% (of 39). Nearly a quarter of patients expected routine HIV testing. This finding should encourage a review of policies promoting HIV testing, especially within the ED.

To assess the perceptions of integrated counseling and testing center (ICTC) counselors with respect to the training received, problems faced in providing services, and job satisfaction. Qualitative methods such as 1 focus group discussion and 7 in-depth interviews were conducted among 14 counselors employed at 13 ICTCs in a costal district of south India. The counselors identified the need for improving refresher training; job perception and satisfaction among counselors was found to be poor; issues such as shared confidentiality and targets for counseling were perceived to affect the ICTC services. The issues identified by counselors such as problems related to refresher training, targets set for counseling and testing, the pay scale and shared confidentiality should be addressed for better service delivery.

The authors aimed to determine the willingness of HIV-positive women for out-of-pocket payment for the cancer screening, if necessary. Questionnaires were administered to 400 HIV-positive women at the Adult HIV clinic, University of Nigeria Teaching Hospital (UNTH), Enugu, Nigeria. In all 11 (2.8%) respondents were aware of Pap smear, but only 1 (9.1%) of them had used it. After cervical cancer screening counseling, 378 (94.5%) respondents were willing to pay for Pap smear, irrespective of the cost. This willingness showed no trend across marital or educational groups. Younger age of respondents was not associated with willingness to pay for Pap smear (odds ratio = 1.24; confidence interval 95%: 0.52, 2.94). Willingness to pay for Pap smear by HIV-positive women in Enugu, Nigeria, is high. This has implication for the program sustainability. ","574":"Lipodystrophy is a known adverse effect of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Lipodystrophy resulting in body dysmorphism can lower the quality of life (QoL) among HAART recipients. The main aim of our study was to find the effect of lipodystrophy on QoL among people living with HIV (PLHIV) on HAART. This cross-sectional study was conducted in a tertiary care hospital in south India. The participants were assessed for the presence of lipodystrophy. Their QoL was assessed using HIV-AIDS-targeted QoL questionnaire (HAT-QoL). Statistical analysis was carried out using SPSS version 11.5. Lipodystrophy was present in 21 participants (42%). The QoL among individuals with lipodystrophy was found to be significantly lower in terms of disclosure worries (P = .023) and financial worries (P = .049). Lipodystrophy adversely affects QoL among PLHIV. There is a need for studies analyzing factors that can potentially improve the QoL in such individuals. ","575":"We conducted a study to investigate HIV and hepatitis delta virus (HDV) coinfection among patients with chronic hepatitis B virus (HBV) infection and the triple infection's (HIV\/HBV\/HDV) clinical implications in India, an intermediate HBV endemic region, with an estimated HIV-positive population of 2.5 million. A total of 450 patients (men: 270; women: 180) with chronic HBV infections and 135 healthy volunteers were screened for HIV and HDV. The incidence of the triple infection was low (4 [0.8%]) compared with dual infections of HIV-1\/HBV (7 [1.5%]) and HBV\/HDV (22[4.8%]). Among 21- to 40-year-olds, HBV\/HDV coinfection (45.8%) and HBV\/HDV\/HIV-1 triple infection was predominant (75%). Among 11 patients coinfected with HIV-1\/HBV, 4 (36%) were tri-infected and were also associated with chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. The HDV coinfection was higher among patients coinfected with HBV\/HIV-1, despite the declining trend in HDV infection among HIV-negative patients, as previously reported. Thus, it is important to assess the impact of HIV, chronic HBV, and HDV tri-infection in India.

We conducted a cross-sectional study of perinatally HIV-infected adolescents, aged 11 to 18 years. Demographically matched controls were also enrolled. The adolescents completed the Youth Self-Report (YSR), while the caregivers filled out the Child Behavior Checklist (CBCL), to determine emotional and behavioral problems. The sample included 50 HIV-infected adolescents and 56 controls. The internalizing problem scores from the YSR were significantly higher in the HIV-infected group than those in the control group (13.76 versus 9.95, P = .02). The total competence scores, from both the self-report and the caregiver report in the HIV-infected group, were significantly lower than those of the control group (P = .005 and .001). Although HAART has prolonged the survival of HIV-infected children, they remain at increased risk of psychosocial problems as well as impaired social functioning.

Cross-sectional and longitudinal analyses were conducted on data from a sample of 864 HIV-infected men who have sex with men (MSM) obtained from a large, nationally distributed HIV clinical cohort. Of the 864 HIV-infected MSM, 394 (46%) were of normal weight, 363 (42%) were overweight, and 107 (12%) were obese at baseline. The baseline CD4 count was 493 (standard error [SE] = 9), with viral load (log10) = 2.4 (SE = .04), and 561 (65%) were virologically suppressed. Over time, controlling for viral load, highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) adherence, age, and race\/ethnicity, overweight and obese HIV-infected men possessed higher CD4 counts than that of normal weight HIV-infected men. Further, overweight and obese men possessed lower viral loads than that of normal weight HIV-infected men. For HIV-infected MSM, in this longitudinal cohort study, possessing a heavier than normal BMI is longitudinally associated with improved immunological health.

","581":"Activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis, assessed in terms of cortisol levels, may enhance the ability of HIV to infect lymphocytes and downregulate the immune system, accelerating disease progression. This study sought to determine the effects of relaxation techniques on cortisol levels in HIV-seropositive women. Women (n = 150) were randomized to a group cognitive-behavioral stress management (CBSM) condition or an individual information condition and underwent 3 types of relaxation training (progressive muscle relaxation, imagery, and autogenic training). Cortisol levels were obtained pre- and postrelaxation. Guided imagery was effective in reducing cortisol in the group condition (t = 3.90, P &lt; .001), and muscle relaxation reduced cortisol in the individual condition (t = 3.1 I, P = .012). Among participants in the group condition attending all sessions, the magnitude of pre- to postsession reduction became greater over time. Results suggest that specific relaxation techniques may be partially responsible for cortisol decreases associated with relaxation and CBSM.

This study examined the relationships between sexual self-efficacy and risk behaviors among 92 HIV-positive Thai youth aged 14 to 21 years. A questionnaire previously validated in Thailand measured sexual self-efficacy. There were low levels of sexual activity with 13 respondents having sex in the last 6 months. The sexual self-efficacy scales were inversely related to the risk behaviors of having sex, having multiple partners, and drinking alcohol in the last 6 months. The scores of the sexual self-efficacy scale and its subscales were significantly lower in those aged 17 to 21 than in 14 to 16. Sexual risk behaviors were significantly higher in those aged 17 to 21 than in 14 to 16. These findings suggest that interventions to increase sexual self-efficacy should be emphasized as HIV-infected Thai youth reach late adolescence.

World Health Organization had developed threshold survey method for surveillance of TDR in resource-limited countries. ART in Thailand has been scaling up for &gt;10 years. To evaluate the current TDR in Thailand, a cross-sectional study was conducted among antiretroviral-naive HIV-infected patients aged &lt;25 years who newly visited infectious disease clinic in a university hospital, in 2011. HIV genotypic-resistance test was performed. World Health Organization 2009 surveillance drug-resistance mutations were used to define TDR. Of 50 patients, the prevalence of TDR was 4%. Of 2 patients with TDR, 1 had K103N and the other had Y181C mutations. Transmitted HIV drug resistance is emerging in Thailand after a decade of rapid scale-up of ART. Interventions to prevent TDR at the population level are essentially needed in Thailand. Surveillance for TDR in Thailand has to be regularly performed.

The authors recruited an online convenience sample of Thai MSM (n = 404) to assess the knowledge of and interest in PrEP. Less than 7% had heard of PrEP; however, 35% indicated interest in PrEP after an explanation of its possible efficacy. Regression modeling demonstrated that HIV knowledge and risk behavior, but not demographics, are significant predictors of PrEP interest. More information and education about PrEP is necessary and more research is needed to examine PrEP acceptability and to inform the message for PrEP uptake.

The burden of serodiscordance and its predictors in Ethiopia is not clearly understood due to the dearth of data. To assess the prevalence and predictors of HIV serodiscordance among couples tested in Jimma University Specialized Hospital (JUSH) Voluntary Counseling and Testing (VCT) center. The study employed a case-control study design conducted at VCT center of JUSH in all registered serodiscordant couples and seroconcordant couples that were selected from the registered clients in the period from 2003 to 2010. A pretested structured questionnaire was used for data collection using medical chart abstraction. Data were entered, cleaned, and coded using Statistical Package of Social Sciences (SPSS) version 16. The prevalence of serodiscordance in the study population was found to be 8.4%. Male and female discordants accounted for 5.8% (137) and 2.6% (62), respectively. Rare use of condom (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 7.2; 95% confidence interval [CI] = 1.59-32.54) and active tuberculosis (TB) at enrollment (AOR= 17.7; 95% CI = 2.3-139.2) were significantly found to be the predictors of serodiscordance. The prevalence of serodiscordance in the study area was found to be low, but it contributes to a clinically significant population that mandates implementation of preventive strategy. Sero-positive individuals who use condoms rarely should be encouraged to have their partners tested, and the association between active TB and serodiscordance underscores the need for further study.

Among the youth who reported recent significant mental health symptoms, comparisons on demographic variables (including race, ethnicity, language spoken, level of education, sexual orientation, and household income) were made. Psychiatrically symptomatic black youth were significantly less likely than symptomatic nonblack peers to receive mental health care (37.4% versus 48.6%) and psychiatric medications (19.3% versus 26.9%). Care providers should be alerted to the potential disparities in mental health care treatment that exist for black youth living with HIV.

Data have been limited to few case reports of patients who present for treatment late in pregnancy, have multidrug resistance, or have poor adherence, requiring an additional class such as an integrase inhibitor to further lower viral load. This case report describes and supports the initiation of RAL in very late pregnancy (week 33) to rapidly decrease viral load and successfully prevent perinatal transmission. By increasing the efficacy and safety data of RAL use in pregnancy, we believe this report can help provide some guidance on the management of complex cases.

In accordance with most of the parameters evaluated, age and the smoking habit harmed the esophageal local immunity, whereas the use of antiretroviral therapy improved the immune characteristics of this organ. Patients with esophagitis also presented immunological fragility of the esophagus. This leads to the conclusion that alterations in the esophageal epithelium of patients with AIDS are not only caused by direct action of HIV but also the clinical and behavioral characteristics of the patient.

Differences between patients with HIV infection that did and did not receive physical therapy, as well as predictors of receipt of physical therapy, were identified. The physical therapy subgroup (n = 69) had a mean age of 48.3 years, consisted of more men than women, and was predominately black, with public health insurance. Admissions were commonly due to non-AIDS-defining illness as the primary diagnoses, accompanied by several comorbidities. Admissions often presented with functional deficits, incurred a prolonged length of stay, and required assistance at discharge. Differences existed between the physical therapy subgroup and the non-physical therapy subgroup (n = 406). Predictors of receipt of physical therapy were functional status on admission and length of stay.

Ineffectual HIV\/AIDS stigma-reduction interventions are the product of inadequate conceptual frameworks and methodological tools. And while there is a paucity of effective interventions to reduce stigma, there is no shortage of conceptual frameworks intending to offer a comprehensive understanding of stigma, ranging from sociocognitive models at the individual level to structural models at the macrolevel. Observations highlighting inadequacies in the individualistic and structural models are offered, followed by the theory of structuration as a possible complementary conceptual base for designing HIV\/AIDS stigma-reduction interventions.","599":"There is a dire need for interventions that will address the multiple factors--poverty, substance use, early sexual debut, and violence--that influence Haitian youth's engagement in risky behaviors. The deteriorating socioeconomic and political state of the country has had a deleterious effect on the sociocultural milieu and on the boundaries that have heretofore kept risky behaviors in check. Historically, the lakou system, a community-based approach that supports the family unit, has disintegrated, leading to the disruption of traditional parenting patterns. The unstable economic system has also led to the increasing use of children from poor families, who through the restavek system, are sent to work as servants in other households. The breakdown of traditional systems, coupled with the increasing economic and political instability, has had a significant effect on Haitian adolescents. Among boys, increased levels of substance use have been associated with multiple sex partnerships and very early sexual debut. Among girls, extremely high rates of sexual abuse and forced sex have led to relatively high levels of HIV. While the majority of them have been exposed to behavior change messages, behavior change itself has lagged because many adolescents do not accurately perceive their risk exposure. This review explores the risks of HIV transmission among Haitian youth, with a focus on vulnerability factors, including substance use, culture, and the socioeconomic context, and provides recommendations for intervention. An ecosystemic approach, designed specifically for Haitian youth and that takes environmental context and culture into account, is needed.","600":"High, persistent levels of antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence are generally required to achieve sustained virologic suppression. Recently published global guidelines on entry into and retention in care and ART adherence include recommendations for monitoring and supporting ART adherence as a standard part of HIV clinical management. Several tools to facilitate the dissemination and implementation of these evidence-based guidelines are under development. A pocket-size Guidelines Regimen Information Program (GRIP) guide was recently developed as a quick reference tool to summarize high impact, strong evidence-based recommendations and to provide a validated single assessment item for use in collecting self-reported adherence estimations from patients as part of standard clinical care. The tool's development and intended use are reviewed and additional recommendations provided to facilitate a brief clinician-patient discussion to link patients to appropriate resources, strategies, or programs. Limitations of the tool and scenarios to avoid are also discussed. With a sizable proportion of individuals on ART trying to achieve or sustain sufficiently high rates of adherence, proactive monitoring of ART adherence and linkage of patients to needed resources is a critical component of high-quality HIV care. The quick reference GRIP guide is intended to be a part of a larger package of approaches to identify patients in need of adherence support regardless of current viral load and to help providers link patients with the available resources.","601":"Stigmatization and discrimination impact negatively on interventions and act as barriers to all HIV\/AIDS activities. This study assessed the relationship between stigmatization and discrimination and adherence to antiretroviral therapy (ART) among HIV-infected patients attending the Federal Medical Centre, Ido-Ekiti, Nigeria. A cross-sectional study was carried out among respondents selected by systematic random sampling. Structured, interviewer-administered questionnaires were used to collect data subsequently analyzed with SPSS 16.

Of 754 patients, 52.2% had CD4 counts &lt;200 cells\/mm3, but only 2.3% belonged to WHO stage IV. Newer CD4 cutoffs generated were 280, 120-280, &lt;120 cells\/mm3. Spearman rank correlation between CD4 counts and TLC was found to be weak (r = .32). The cutoff values of CD4 counts for HIV disease may need to be revised for India. Regular CD4 count estimation is a must for monitoring disease progression in people living with HIV\/AIDS. ","611":null,"612":"Realization of the right to health occurs along a continuum including national ratification of international treaties such as the Convention on the Rights of the Child, passage of domestic laws and policies that may specify modes of implementation and enforcement such as Kenya's Constitution and HIV and AIDS Prevention and Control Act, and actual implementation of domestic laws and policies such as through the regulation and delivery of health services. The stages heuristic theoretical framework describes the public policy continuum as consisting of marked stages: agenda setting, policy formulation, policy implementation, and evaluation. This case study illustrates the continuum in Kenya with regard to pediatric HIV testing. Kenya has made progress applying law, policy, and science to reduce vertical transmission of HIV and increase HIV testing of infants, although several challenges remain. Progress in policy implementation may reduce mother-to-child transmission and increase pediatric HIV testing.","613":"Depression is common among people living with HIV\/AIDS in sub-Saharan Africa. Yet, little is known about how depression influences physical health and socioeconomic well-being in the context of antiretroviral therapy (ART). Semistructured interviews with 40 adult HIV clients receiving ART in Uganda were conducted to assess experiences prior to and after HIV diagnosis and initiation of ART. Content analysis revealed themes that were suggestive of the following patterns: (1) functioning decreased after patients were diagnosed with HIV, but improved following ART, (2) depression is associated with lower physical health functioning and work status levels after both HIV diagnosis and ART, and (3) antidepressant medication is associated with better functioning compared with patients with depression not receiving depression treatment. These findings suggest that depression plays a role in the deleterious effects of HIV on functioning, and that antidepressant treatment provided alongside ART may serve to help individuals regain functioning, particularly employment. These findings highlight the potential value of integrating depression treatment into HIV care. ","614":"Drug-induced lupus (DIL) is a rare adverse reaction to medications with features resembling idiopathic systemic lupus erythromatosis. Rifabutin\/rifamycins have only rarely been reported as a cause of DIL, and no cases have been reported in blacks. A 55-year-old African American woman with HIV presented with severe generalized arthralgias and recurrent oral ulcers while receiving treatment for tuberculous meningitis. Arthralgias, which began in her knees after 5 weeks of antituberculous therapy, progressed to involve the joints in the ankles, wrists, and hands. She had no associated fever or rash. When she had these symptoms her antinuclear antibody (ANA) was 1:1280 homogenous pattern, antidouble stranded DNA was negative, antihistone antibody was strongly positive, anti-smith and antiribonucleoprotein (anti-RNP) were negative. Her symptoms resolved within 2 months of stopping rifabutin while continuing other antituberculous medications and her ANA titer started to decrease. We review the existing literature on this subject.","615":"Knowing the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) status of persons infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis is important for individual treatment and preventing transmission. This evaluation analyzed surveillance data and surveyed health care providers who care for patients with HIV and tuberculosis (TB) to understand the factors contributing to suboptimal levels of Connecticut patients with TB having a known HIV status. During 2008 to 2010, 208 (76.2%) of 273 patients had a known HIV status; 12 (5.8%) were HIV-positive. Patients who were more likely to have a known HIV status were younger (40.5 vs 54.6 years, P &lt; .001) or received care in a TB clinic (risk ratio, 1.26; 95% confidence interval, 1.12-1.42). Among 77 providers, 48 (62.3%) completed the survey, 42 (87.5%) reported routinely offering HIV testing to patients with TB, and 26 (54.2%) reported routinely offering HIV testing to patients with latent TB infection (LTBI). We conclude that interventions for improving HIV testing should focus on non-TB clinic providers and patients with LTBI. ","616":"HIV\/AIDS stigma continues to be a challenge for HIV prevention and treatment. When health professionals manifest stigma it can limit access to quality treatment. With an ever-growing epidemic among Latinos, including Puerto Ricans living on the Caribbean Island, the social and structural factors that foster HIV\/AIDS stigma need to be understood. In this study, we documented the association of religion with HIV\/AIDS stigma in a sample of medical students in Puerto Rico. Findings suggest that importance placed on religion, and participation in religious activities, is associated with HIV\/AIDS stigma for this population.","617":"Non-AIDS-defining cancers in HIV-infected patients in the highly active antiretroviral therapy era have increased. To our knowledge a comprehensive review of non-AIDS-related malignancies in New Orleans has not yet been conducted. Databases from main institutions in New Orleans were queried retrospectively for the years 2001 to 2011. The International Classification of Diseases, Ninth Revision codes were used to search for HIV infection and cancer comorbidity. A total of 16 patients were diagnosed with lung cancer (mean age 50 years) with 81% of the patients presenting with advanced stages. In all, 20 (mean age 47 years) were diagnosed with anal cancer, and 35% presented in late stages. In all, 14 patients (mean age 42 years) were diagnosed with Hodgkin Lymphoma, and 64% were diagnosed at late stage. A total of 5 women (mean age 44 years) were diagnosed with breast cancer with 40% of them presenting at late stage. Malignancies were diagnosed at late stages in the majority of the cases, presented with worse outcomes, and had higher recurrence rates. The role of HIV and other viruses (Epstein Barr virus, human papillomavirus) and the potential mechanisms or pathways of oncogene activation also need to be clarified. ","618":"Identification of broadly neutralizing antibodies (NAbs) generated during the course of HIV-1 infection is essential for effective HIV-1 vaccine design. The magnitude and breadth of neutralizing activity in the sera from 46 antiretroviral treatment-naive HIV-1 clade C-infected individuals was measured in a single round infection assay using TZM-bl cells and multisubtype panel of env-pseudotyped viruses. Higher levels of NAb response (NAb titer 500 to &gt;40 000) were measured in these patients against tier 1 and tier 2 viruses. The average magnitude of the NAb responses of chronically infected individuals against heterologous viruses was consistently higher than the response observed from individuals with long-term nonprogressor ( P = .086). To conclude, high titers of HIV-1 cross-neutralizing activity were observed in the sera from a subset of HIV-1-infected individuals in Chennai, India. Additional studies of the epitopes recognized by these antibodies may facilitate the discovery of an effective vaccine immunogen.","619":null,"620":"Oral preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) with antiretrovirals (ARVs) is at the forefront of biomedical HIV prevention research, and ARVs are also being tested for rectal administration to target people practicing unprotected receptive anal intercourse (URAI) and at risk of HIV infection. This study assessed the acceptability of daily oral PrEP and rectal PrEP during URAI among men who have sex with men (MSM) and transgender women (TGW) in Peru. During the 2008 HIV sentinel surveillance survey conducted in 3 Peruvian cities (Lima, Iquitos, and Pucallpa), MSM and TGW reported being \"versatile,\" \"most of the time receptive,\" and \"exclusively receptive\" during anal sex behavior where surveyed on their acceptability of oral and rectal PrEP. Among 532 individuals, high acceptance of either oral (96.2%) or rectal (91.7%) PrEP products was reported. If both products were efficacious\/available, 28.6% would prefer a pill, 57.3% a rectal lubricant, and 14.1% either. A trend toward higher acceptance was observed as receptive anal sex behavior exclusivity rose (P = .013). Being receptive most of the time (adjusted odds ratio [aOR]: 9.1, P = .01) and exclusively receptive (aOR: 7.5, P = .01), compared to being versatile, were independently associated with oral PrEP acceptability. A similar association was found with the acceptability of rectal formulations (aOR: 2.3, P = .07; and aOR: 2.5, P = .02; respectively). Oral and rectal PrEP were highly acceptable among Peruvian MSM and TGW, particularly among those at the highest HIV infection risk. These data can guide the implementation of PrEP programs in Peru and similar settings and populations. ","621":null,"622":"Individuals testing HIV positive were interviewed at testing centers, followed prospectively and interviewed again when they registered at referral antiretroviral therapy (ART) centers (ARTCs). Those who did not register at ARTCs were traced and interviewed in the community. A total of 1057 newly diagnosed people living with HIV (PLHIV; 52% women; mean age, 34.7 years) were recruited. A total of 73.5% of PLHIV registered at referral ARTCs within 60 days, 17.9% did not register and were interviewed in the community, and 8.6% were not interviewed. The 2 main reasons cited for not registering were a perception of good health (30%) and work\/family engagements (22%). Single clients (adjusted relative risk [ARR]: 1.54; 95% confidence interval [CI]: 1.02-2.34), participants who had not disclosed their HIV status (ARR: 2.32; 95%CI: 1.77-3.05), participants who knew a PLHIV (ARR: 1.89; 95% CI: 1.41-2.53), and participants from laborer households (ARR: 2.66; 95%CI:1.15-6.15) were more likely to not register. In conclusion, the majority of newly diagnosed PLHIV do reach ARTCs. Disclosure concerns and a perception of good health prevent PLHIV from accessing services. ","623":"Dramatic increases in the evidence-base for intervention approaches to support antiretroviral therapy (ART) adherence have resulted in numerous reviews, syntheses, and guidelines\/recommendations. This review characterizes the current state of the literature and identifies areas in need of additional targeted focus to better align research and practice. Leading recommendations for the process of intervention development (relevant to both rigorous research and real-world intervention planning) and strategies to consider in working with individuals, communities, and systems are provided. In order to move systematically toward the identification of what kinds of interventions work best for whom and when, attending to both intervention outcomes and \"drivers\" of observed effects or lack of effects in controlled research is critically important. Further, evidence emerging from practice should be aggressively added to research agendas to promote better synergies between the practice and research communities.","624":"HIV\/AIDS-related stigma has been linked to poor adherence resulting in drug resistance and the failure to control HIV. This study used both quantitative and qualitative methods to examine stigma and its relationship to adherence in 30 HIV-infected Thai youth aged 14 to 21 years. Stigma was measured using the HIV stigma scale and its 4 subscales, and adherence was measured using a visual analog scale. Stigma and adherence were also examined by in-depth interviews. The interviews were to determine whether verbal responses would match the scale's results. The mean score of stigma perception from the overall scale and its 4 subscales ranged from 2.14 to 2.45 on a scale of 1 to 4, indicating moderate levels of stigma. The mean adherence score was .74. The stigma scale and its subscales did not correlate with the adherence. Totally, 17 of the respondents were interviewed. Contrary to the quantitative results, the interviewees reported that the stigma led to poor adherence because the fear of disclosure often caused them to miss medication doses. The differences between the quantitative and the qualitative results highlight the importance of validating psychometric scales when they are translated and used in other cultures. ","625":"Data on the use of ritonavir-boosted darunavir (DRV\/r) and\/or raltegravir (RAL) in resource-limited settings are rare and there is currently no published data regarding their use among African children. Botswana has recently made DRV\/r and RAL available for patients failing second-line antiretroviral therapy (ART). Retrospective chart review of 4 multidrug-resistant pediatric patients on DRV\/r- and\/or RAL-based regimens. Viral load, CD4 count, adherence by pill count, and World Health Organization (WHO) clinical stage prior to and after switch to DRV\/r- and\/or RAL-based regimen were assessed. Antiretroviral therapy history, duration of virologic failure, and time to viral suppression were also noted. Genotypic resistance assays reviewed for mutations present prior to switch. All patients achieved viral suppression, showed improved\/stable CD4 counts, and obtained or maintained WHO clinical treatment stage I, even after long-standing virologic\/immunologic failure. Well tolerated by and effective in our patients, DRV\/r and RAL provide potentially lifesaving ART options for children and adolescents in resource-limited settings failing ART due to ritonavir-boosted lopinavir (LPV\/r) resistance. ","626":null,"627":"Effectiveness of antiretroviral therapy (ART) in a routine clinical care may result different from the clinical trials. We assessed the virologic outcomes in treatment-naive persons who received either efavirenz (EFV) or atazanavir\/ritonavir (ATV\/r) with a backbone of tenofovir\/emtricitabine (TDF\/FTC) as their combination ART (cART). This was a retrospective cohort study conducted at the Washington University HIV Outpatient Clinic from January 2004 to June 2009. Predictors of virologic suppression (HIV RNA level &lt;400 copies\/mL) by week 48 were assessed by multivariate Cox proportional hazards regression models. Of 324 persons, 221(68%) received EFV and 103 (32%) received ATV\/r. Persons on EFV had 1.4-fold increased likelihood of virologic suppression (95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.8) when compared to ATV\/r after adjustment with primary drug resistance, pre-cART opportunistic infection, HIV RNA levels, and timing to start cART. In routine clinical care settings, EFV had higher likelihood of achieving virologic suppression than ATV\/r with backbone of TDF\/FTC. ","628":null,"629":"Some patients with HIV develop dementia. Using in vivo proton nuclear magnetic resonance ((1)H-NMR) spectroscopy, it is possible to measure the metabolic changes noninvasively. In this study, it is of interest to answer the clinically relevant question of whether magnetic resonance spectroscopy is suitable for the diagnosis of HIV encephalopathy. In total, 14 HIV-positive patients were investigated by means of localized (1)H-NMR spectroscopy in the following locations: (1) the mid-parietal gray matter, (2) the parietal white matter (PWM), and (3) the frontal white matter. All patients had no other brain diseases, apart from the HIV encephalopathy. The clinical extent of HIV encephalopathy of each patient was investigated using the following tests: (1) an electroencephalogram, (2) a neurological examination and psychiatric assessment, and (3) a psychometrical test. The spectroscopic changes in the PWM were more pronounced than those in the cortex, and the myo-inositol\/creatine (mI\/Cr) signal showed a clear increase in the cortex. Overall, the mI\/Cr ratio emerged as the most reliable and earliest parameter to indicate an HIV encephalopathy. ","630":"To analyze the epidemiology and outcome for patients with HIV coinfected with hepatitis in comparison with monoinfected patients. At the First Affiliated Hospital at Xinjiang Medical University in Urumqi, China, 395 patients were diagnosed with HIV between 2001 and 2010. The main routes of transmission were sexual (30%) and intravenous drug use (33%). The patient records were studied retrospectively. A total of 135 patients had markers of viral hepatitis (34.2%). Abnormal liver function was seen among 48.9% of these patients. Hepatitis B surface antigen was positive in 24 patients (6.1%), with 15 (3.8%) being hepatitis B virus (HBV)-DNA positive, none on tenofovir treatment, because it is still not provided free in Xinjiang. Hepatitis C antibodies were found in 98 patients (24.8%), 46 (11.6%) were hepatitis C virus (HCV)-RNA positive. Only 1 patient had been treated with interferon and ribavirin. Both HBV and HCV were found in 13 (3.3%) of the patients. Nearly half of the HIV patients in Urumqi had markers of hepatitis. Only antiretroviral treatment is provided free, and most of the patients cannot afford the hepatitis treatment they need, which has to be addressed in the treatment programs. ","631":"About 5% to 10% of HIV-infected patients develop thrombocytopenia during the course of the disease, and immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) may be the sole clinical manifestation of HIV infection. The clinical picture is indistinguishable from the classic auto-ITP. Treatment is the same as that given for classic ITP as the pathogenesis is in many ways similar. Steroids, intravenous immunoglobulins (IVIGs), and antiretroviral therapy (ART) have all been tried with varied results but have been associated with fall in platelet count on withdrawal of therapy. We report a case of a 13-year-old girl who presented with thrombocytopenic purpura and had no response to ART but had normalization of platelet count while on steroids, which immediately fell below the normal range on withdrawing the steroids.","632":"The use of maraviroc in our unit was reviewed with regard to efficacy and safety and also reviewed with regard to how our experience reflects the data presented in clinical trials. We utilized the pharmacy dispensary system to identify any patient dispensed maraviroc and conducted a case note review. We identified 27 patients who have been prescribed maraviroc as part of their antiretroviral treatment. In all, 81% were men and 81% were white British. There were 26 treatment-experienced patients and 1 treatment-naive patient. At the time of switching to maraviroc, 17 patients had detectable HIV viral loads and 10 had HIV RNA levels &lt;40 copies\/mL. At completion, 6 undetectable patients maintained undetectability and 10 viremically detectable patients achieved viral suppression. Maraviroc was discontinued in 18.5% of patients and the only adverse drug reaction reported was a rash. The experience of using maraviroc by our study participants shows similarity in terms of efficacy and safety to the MERIT and MOTIVATE clinical trials. ","633":"Chronic renal insufficiency is a barrier for the treatment of hepatitis C virus (HCV), and yet virus clearance is desirable prior to kidney transplantation. Several reports document success of kidney transplantation in the setting of HIV infection. We analyzed the treatment outcome of patients with HIV and HCV genotype 1 infections and chronic kidney disease, who received pegylated interferon with or without ribavirin in our center. Of the 7 patients, 2 achieved sustained virological response. None of the responders had end-stage renal disease, suggesting that HCV treatment is most likely to be successful in earlier stages of renal disease.","634":"A private multispecialty hospital in Kakinada, Andhra Pradesh, India. A survey of knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions adapted from a pretested questionnaire was administered to 128 HIV-infected adults, from July to August 2008. A total of 31% had not heard of tuberculosis (TB), with 15 (38%) currently receiving anti-TB therapy or had received it in the past. Of those familiar with TB, 70% could not list a method by which it was spread. Low education attainment, female sex, and less frequent television exposure were associated with low TB literacy. HIV-infected patients in southeast India have poor knowledge of TB and the methods by which it is spread. Scale-up of patient-directed educational programs is necessary to help control TB in India. ","635":"The quality of life of people living with HIV and AIDS (PLWHA) is becoming increasingly important--a fact that is also reflected in extensive research efforts. Owing to the almost complete lack of systematic integration of research findings, it is hardly possible to provide an overview of the current status of research, or to derive valid statements about research results. A literature search regarding the quality of life of PLWHA was performed in two international research databases. After checking their relevance, 852 publications appearing in scientific journals and explicitly measuring the quality of life of PLWHA were categorized on the basis of various study characteristics. The number of publications per year in our study pool has been rising steadily since 1989. Well over 40 established instruments were used to determine the quality of life, most frequently the MOS-HIV, followed by the SF-36. The great majority of the studies are correlation studies. CD4 cells, gender, and age are the most common variables for which correlations with quality of life are reported. Our descriptive review stresses both the increasing significance and the challenges of research into quality of life of PLWHA such as the great variety of instruments used. The limits of this review are discussed and we conclude with the formulation of research desiderata concerning comparative review studies on instruments and systematic reviews of frequent research questions. ","636":"HIV-1-infected patients are surviving longer and by 2015 half will be older than 50 years of age. Frailty is a syndrome associated with advanced age but occurs in HIV-1-infected patients at younger ages. One hundred outpatient HIV-1-infected persons were prospectively tested for clinical markers of frailty: shrinking weight, slowness in walking, decrease in grip strength, low activity, and exhaustion. Age, length of infection with HIV, CD4 count, HIV-1 RNA, and comorbidities were compared. CD4 counts &lt;200 cells\/mm(3) were associated with 9-fold increased odds of frailty relative to patients with a CD4 count &gt;350 cells\/mm(3) (odds ratio [OR] 9.0, 95% confidence interval [CI] 2.1-44). Seven frail patients were measured 6 months later: 2 died refusing therapy, 4 were no longer frail, and 1 patient remained frail. We conclude that frailty is common in HIV outpatients and is associated with low CD4 counts. However, our data suggest that frailty is transient, especially in younger patients who may revert to their prefrail state unlike uninfected elderly individuals in whom a stepwise decline in function occurs.","637":"HIV-infected refugees resettled in the United States face many challenges. Longitudinal data regarding HIV-specific outcomes in this population are limited. We reviewed charts of 51 HIV-infected sub-Saharan African refugees matched to 102 nonrefugees. Outcomes analyzed included CD4 counts, viral loads (VLs), antiretroviral treatment (ART) use, appointment adherence, opportunistic infections, and resistance mutations. The ART initiation was similar. Appointment adherence was similar in year 1, but refugees were significantly less adherent beyond year 3. Refugees and nonrefugees spent similar amounts of time in care suppressed (83% vs 80%, P = .93). Refugees had higher odds of viremia following undetectable VL (OR 2.3, P &lt; .05). Initially, sub-Saharan African HIV-infected refugees have comparable appointment adherence, ART use, and VL suppression to nonrefugees. Overtime refugees were less adherent to appointments and more likely to have postsuppression viremia. The support services provided to refugees early in care may be important for retention in care and treatment success. ","638":null,"639":"We determine the frequency and immunological outcome of developing immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome (IRIS) among HIV\/tuberculosis (TB)-coinfected Indians receiving highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART). Patients coinfected with TB and HIV who initiated HAART were classified based on treatment outcomes (IRIS and non-IRIS) utilizing an observational HIV\/AIDS cohort. A total of 1731 HIV\/TB-coinfected patients initiated HAART, and 95 of these patients (5.5%) developed TB-IRIS, with an incidence rate of 0.26 per 100 person-years. Patients who developed IRIS had significantly higher CD4 counts than non-IRIS patients at the time of initiating HAART, as well as after 6 months, 18 months, and 24 months following HAART initiation (P &lt; .05). HIV\/TB-coinfected patients who developed IRIS following HAART initiation had equivalent clinical outcomes compared with their HIV\/TB-coinfected counterparts who did not develop IRIS, suggesting minimal long-term risks associated with IRIS. ","640":"Depression is emerging as a highly prevalent psychiatric condition among people living with HIV\/AIDS (PLWHA). Perceived family support (PFS) buffers depression among chronic disease patients. However, a similar relationship among PLWHA is unexplored. To examine the relationship between PFS and depression among PLWHA in the Kathmandu Valley, Nepal. In this cross-sectional study, depression was measured by Beck Depression Inventory Ia. Perceived family support was measured by Nepali Family Support and Difficulties Scale. The status of depression was compared between 208 PLWHA and 208 HIV-negative participants. The relationship between PFS and depression was examined only among PLWHA. Among each of the 208 participants, the number of depressed PLWHA (n = 61,29.3%) was higher than that of HIV-negative participants (n = 13,6.2%; P &lt; .001). Perceived family support had a negative association with depression in PLWHA (adjusted odds ratio [AOR] = 0.20, 95% confidence interval [CI] = 0.08-0.53). In Nepal, PLWHA display a higher level of depression than HIV-negative people, and a lower level of PFS is associated with depression among PLWHA. Improved family support might be helpful in reducing depression among Nepalese PLWHA. ","641":"Inability to retain HIV-infected patients in care undermines the benefits of starting millions in low-income countries on antiretroviral therapy (ART). In a hospital HIV clinic in rural southern Ethiopia, we conducted focus groups of HIV-infected men and women to learn more about experiences with and barriers to attending clinic appointments. Respondents reported multiple barriers, including those that were patient related (eg, misunderstandings about ART, mistaken belief in AIDS cures, and drug\/alcohol use), clinic related (eg, negative provider interactions, lack of familiarity with patients' medical situation, and overcrowding), medication related (eg, side effects), social (eg, stigma and discrimination and lack of support), and situational\/resource related (eg, distance to clinic, lack of funds, competing domestic\/work priorities, and lack of food). Based on the lessons learned from these focus groups, we implemented a community intervention to improve retention, using trained community support workers who provide patient education, counseling, social support, problem-solving assistance, needed referrals, and improved communication\/linkage to the patients' HIV clinic.","642":"HIV medication nonadherence is a major problem, yet many providers lack the time and training to carefully ask patients about their adherence. To design and pilot a technology-assisted intervention, for use in clinical settings, to identify nonadherent patients. The intervention uses audio computer-assisted self-interview (ACASI) to improve the assessment of adherence and medication-related problems. Patients completed a touch screen computer ACASI which generated graphic clinician and patient reports for discussion during the clinical encounter. 72 patients and 11 providers participated in this study. The patients easily completed the ACASI. Adherence was 63% (3-day) and 47% (30-day). Using the ACASI, 22% of patients identified themselves as nonadherent, when their providers perceived them as adherent. This ACASI-based intervention is easy to use and helps identify nonadherence. The pilot test engendered enhancements including the addition of phone-based adherence counseling. A larger trial is underway to evaluate whether the intervention leads to improved HIV-related outcomes. ","643":"The clinical presentation of cardiac abnormalities in HIV-infected patients may be atypical or masked by concurrent illnesses that lead to misdiagnosis or they remain undiagnosed; therefore, this study was aimed to determine the frequency of cardiac abnormalities in HIV-infected patients. Consecutive HIV-infected patients of age &gt;13 years were studied for 3 months, after obtaining their consent. After clinical assessment, chest x-ray, electrocardiogram, 2-dimensional echocardiography and serum Troponin T levels were done. A total of 100 patients were studied, cardiomegaly was observed in the x-ray of 15% of them, abnormal electrocardiogram was seen in 18%, 2-dimensional echocardiography was abnormal in 67%; and diastolic dysfunction (42.8%) was the commonest abnormality followed by dilated cardiomyopathy (17.6%). Serum troponin T was elevated in 8%. The variables, opportunistic infections (OIs), antiretroviral therapy (ART), stage of HIV disease, and CD4 counts, did not affect the frequency of diastolic dysfunction. The diastolic dysfunction is the most common cardiac abnormality observed in HIV-infected patients. ","644":"Persons living with HIV (PLWH) need practical tools to self-manage their condition. We conducted a proof-of-concept study among PLWH to assess whether patients could learn to use a personal health record (PHR) on a hand-held device (iPod Touch) to manage their condition. We began individual trainings and later adapted this to group training. We assessed usability, acceptability and also effects on self-efficacy for treatment adherence using the HIV Treatment Adherence Self-Efficacy Scale (HIV-ASES). Nine PLWH participated in the individual training and 29 participated in the group sessions. The participants were largely middle aged, low-income and of racial\/ethnic minorities. The sessions were well attended and participants fully engaged in tasks and shared learning. Most participants stated they intended to use the PHR and reported improved self-efficacy in treatment adherence (P = .05) particularly on the integration of treatment adherence into one's routine (P &lt; .02). Training PLWH in use of a handheld PHR shows promise. ","645":"This paper examines the scientific bases for the recommendations on readiness, trust, and adherence that were contained in 5 HIV treatment guidelines. The authors reviewed the treatment guidelines of 5 internationally recognized expert panels, and 5 review articles on readiness, trust, and adherence to determine the evidence for the guidelines' recommendations. These review articles were assessed to determine whether they contained: 1) a definition of the concept, 2) a measure that predicted outcomes, or 3) evidence that a replicable intervention altered outcomes. There is no good definition, measure, or evidence that readiness predicts adherence. There were no interventions that improved readiness in a clinically useful way. There was no good definition or measure of trust, nor was there evidence that patient trust predicts adherence or that interventions improve trust. It is not clear whether trust is a cause or an effect of clinical outcomes. There is agreement that adherence is defined as taking medications as prescribed. Six measures of adherence were found, and several studies showed that they correlated poorly when applied to the same sample of patients. Adherence interventions have had some success but are poorly described and idiosyncratic such that it is difficult to replicate them in other settings. Research on readiness and trust are unlikely to yield useful results. Systematic, long term research on clinician-based adherence interventions must be done. A life-long process such as adherence to antiretroviral treatment is unlikely to be understood without having a long-term study of a cohort of patients taking these medications. ","646":"Since minimal information exists on how individuals work within existing social norms to reduce HIV risk, this study explored the specific factors influencing men and women to reduce their HIV risk in the face of prevailing gender norms in rural villages of Cabo Delgado, Mozambique. Qualitative data were gathered from 160 participants through 29 in-depth interviews to explore gender norms, HIV risk determinants, and risk reduction responses. Results were analyzed using adaptations of grounded theory and constant comparative analysis. Men and women who actively take measures to decrease their risk of HIV infection associate a partner's acceptance of condom use and an HIV test as confirmation of emotional intimacy in the relationship. Other factors influencing risk reduction efforts include various levels of influence from family or peers, prior experience, relationship dynamics, and a reflection of broader personal outcomes.","647":null,"648":"This study aimed to determine the effect of antiretroviral therapy (ART) on glycemia and transaminase levels in HIV-infected patients in Limbe, Cameroon. A total of 200 ART-experienced patients and 30 ART-naive HIV-infected controls were recruited after submitting signed informed consent forms. The blood samples collected were screened for hepatitis B and C, and liver transaminases and random blood sugar (RBS) levels were determined spectrophotometrically. No significant correlation existed between the RBS and transaminase levels with either the duration of ART or the duration since HIV diagnosis. Although both groups of patients appeared to have similar transaminase and RBS levels, after controlling for confounders, patients on ART had significantly higher aspartate aminotransferase levels, significantly lower alanine aminotransferase levels, and slightly (but not significantly) lower glycemia levels (respective mean differences of 14.92 IU\/L, P = .00; 11.95 IU\/L, P = .00; and 7.60 mg\/dL, P = .19).

The newly diagnosed HIV cases were assessed to obtain sociodemographic and clinical findings. Eyesenk Personality Questionnaire (EPQ), World Health Organization Quality of Life Brief (WHOQOL-BREF) for HIV-infected patients, and Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) were used to get data regarding personality traits, QOL, and depression scores. A total of 175 patients were included in the study, 128 (73.1%) men and 47 (26.9%) women. Overall 56% of patients screened positive for depression. Presence of depression and high neuroticism score in the personality profile of HIV-infected patients are significantly associated with poorer QOL. High neuroticism score was a strong predictor of poorer QOL in psychological and spiritual domain. Management of HIV-infected patients therefore needs to address these psychological issues. ","651":null,"652":"Viral load monitoring of antiretroviral therapy in low-income countries is rarely used because of high costs. Reducing the frequency of monitoring may make it financially feasible. We modeled three testing schemes: reduced viral load monitoring (RVLM) with CD4 count at baseline and viral load testing at 6, 36, and 60 months; United States Department of Health and Human Services (US DHHS) Treatment Guidelines; and World Health Organization (WHO) Guidelines using a cohort of 313 HIV-infected patients using Kaplan-Meier analysis. Median time to detection of antiretroviral therapy (ART) failure using RVLM was 147 days; using US DHHS, it was 115 days; and using WHO guidelines, it was 1110 days. Median time for the development of first thymidine analog mutation was 594 days. The cost of RVLM was significantly lower than US DHHS. RVLM detected failure significantly sooner than CD4 count monitoring alone at a lower cost than US DHHS monitoring. RVLM is a potentially effective method of monitoring ART in resource-limited settings. ","653":"The purpose of this descriptive study is to highlight the physical and mental health symptoms of 68 rural women living with AIDS (WLA) in India, their compliance to antiretroviral therapy (ART) medication, and barriers to accessing health care within the past 6 months. Physical and mental health status was obtained by self-report, administered by questionnaire and physician-determined clinical assessment, as well as selected objective parameters. Findings revealed that while rural WLA had been on antiretroviral therapy for just under 2 years, they self-reported a high prevalence of physical symptoms, and more than half reported high levels of depressive symptoms and major barriers to accessing health care. CD4 levels, body weight, and basal metabolic rate were also low. While the rural and urban WLA faced similar health care challenges, the demographic characteristics of the rural women may make them more vulnerable, as they are less adherent to ART and slimmer than their urban counterparts. ","654":null,"655":"Stigma shapes the lives of people living with HIV and may affect their willingness to seek medical care. But treatment delays can compromise health and increase the risk of transmission to others. To examine whether the 4 stigma manifestations--enacted (discrimination), vicarious (hearing stories of discrimination), felt normative (perceptions of stigma's prevalence), and internalized (personal endorsement of stigma beliefs)--were linked with delays in seeking care among HIV-infected people in India. A cross-sectional survey was conducted with 961 HIV-positive men and women in Mumbai and Bengaluru. Enacted and internalized stigmas were correlated with delays in seeking care after testing HIV positive. Depression symptoms mediated the associations of enacted and internalized stigmas with care-seeking delays, whereas efforts to avoiding disclosing HIV status mediated only the association between internalized stigma and care-seeking delays. It is vital to develop stigma reduction interventions to ensure timely receipt of care. ","656":"Adherence to therapy is central to the success of antiretroviral treatment (ART). With the availability of free ART under the national program in India, cost of ART is no longer the primary determinant of adherence. This study evaluated the adherence and factors influencing it among patients receiving free ART in a public health ART center in India. The adherence and its influences among 250 HIV-positive patients on first line ART for at least 3 months from the ART Center of Maulana Azad Medical College and Lok Nayak Hospital, New Delhi, India were analyzed. The adherence was assessed by patients' self report using the adult AIDS Clinical Trial Group (ACTG) questionnaire and counter checked with pharmacy records. The association of various parameters affecting adherence levels was analyzed by using SPSS package and Epiinfo software. Of the 250 patients, 242 (96.8%) had optimum adherence (&gt;95%) and 8 (3.2%) were \"non-adherent.\" CD4 counts (P = 0.05), high level of belief among patients, patients' knowledge about importance of adherence (P = 0.04), and sound mental health were positively influencing adherence. The main barriers to adherence were poor mental health and negative psychological states in the patients (0.001). The presence of adverse reactions to ART also resulted in poorer adherence. The modifiable factors most strongly associated with good adherence rates were higher current CD4 counts, patients' beliefs in ART, and positive mental health. These factors can be targeted by simple, practical interventions to improve and maintain high adherence levels. ","657":"This study aimed at describing the sexual behavior of HIV-positive women in Cameroon. In a cross-sectional study, 282 HIV-infected women were enrolled in 3 HIV-treatment clinics in Cameroon. Of the 282 participants, 257 had been diagnosed with HIV for more than 6 months. Approximately half (46.8%) of these 257 women reported no sex partners in the 6 months before the study; 42.9% had 1 partner; and 1.5% had more than 1 partner. There was a significant decrease in the number of partners, new partners, and an increase in condom use with these partners following HIV diagnosis (P value &lt; .05). However, more than half (55.2%) of the sexually active participants reported inconsistent or no condom use during sexual intercourse. Although HIV-positive women tend to adopt less risky behavior after HIV diagnosis, a substantial proportion of sexually active ones still have risky behaviors. Reinforcing risk reduction programs for these women is imperative.","658":"The Caribbean and Central America represent a formidable challenge for researchers and policy makers in the HIV field, due to their pronounced heterogeneity in terms of social, economic, and cultural contexts and the different courses the HIV epidemic has followed in the region. Such contrasting contexts and epidemics can be exemplified by 2 countries that share the island of Hispaniola, the French Creole-speaking Haiti, and the Spanish-speaking Dominican Republic. Haiti has experienced the worst epidemics outside of sub-Saharan Africa. Following a protracted economic and social crisis, recently aggravated by a devastating earthquake, the local HIV epidemic could experience resurgence. The region, strategically located on the way between coca-producing countries and the profitable North American markets, has been a transshipment area for years. Notwithstanding, the impact of such routes on local drug scenes has been very heterogeneous and dynamic, depending on a combination of local mores, drug enforcement activities, and the broad social and political context. Injecting drug use remains rare in the region, but local drug scenes are dynamic under the influence of increasing mobility of people and goods to and from North and South America, growing tourism and commerce, and prostitution. The multiple impacts of the recent economic and social crisis, as well as the influence of drug-trafficking routes across the Caribbean and other Latin American countries require a sustained effort to track changes in the HIV risk environment to inform sound drug policies and initiatives to minimize drug-related harms in the region.","659":"Stigma is an important issue for marginalized HIV-infected populations. We describe stigma among HIV-infected women on antiretroviral therapy and associations with access to clinical care, demographic factors, and structural elements of support. HIV-infected women attending a government-supported clinic in Kolkata, India, were asked about experiences with stigma. Clinical information was abstracted from medical records. We described factors associated with stigma using ordinal logistic regression. Among 198 women, higher levels of stigma were associated with lower CD4 count upon entry into care (aOR = 0.78; 95% confidence interval [CI]: [0.65, 0.94]), district of residence (aOR = 1.9; CI: [1.0, 3.4]), presence of extended family in the household (aOR = 0.57; CI: [0.32, 1.0]), and employment at the time of the interview (aOR = 0.48; CI: [0.26, 0.90]). Stigma was not associated with having missed scheduled HIV care appointments. Stigma is prevalent among Indian women with HIV, should be further explored, and may be important in considering public health interventions for better access to care.
