cinaedi is an enterohepatic Helicobacter that causes bacteremia and other diseases in humans. While H. cinaedi-like strains are isolated from animals, including dog isolates belonging to a recently proposed H. canicola, little is known about the genetic differences between H. cinaedi and these animal isolates. Here, we sequenced 43 H. cinaedi- or H. canicola-like strains isolated from humans, hamsters, rats and dogs and collected 81 genome sequences of H. cinaedi, H. canicola and other enterohepatic Helicobacter strains from public databases. Genomic comparison of these strains identified four distinct clades (clades I-IV) in H. cinaedi\/canicola\/'magderbugensis' (HCCM) complex. Among these, clade I corresponds to H. cinaedi sensu stricto and represents a human-adapted lineage in the complex. We identified several genomic features unique to clade I. They include the accumulation of antimicrobial resistance-related mutations that reflects the human association of clade I and the larger genome size and the presence of a CRISPR-Cas system and multiple toxin-antitoxin and restriction-modification systems, both of which indicate the contribution of horizontal gene transfer to the evolution of clade I. In addition, nearly all clade I strains but only a few strains belonging to one minor clade contained a highly variable genomic region encoding a type VI secretion system (T6SS), which could play important roles in gut colonization by killing competitors or inhibiting their growth. We also developed a method to systematically search for H. cinaedi sequences in large metagenome data sets based on the results of genome comparison. Using this method, we successfully identified multiple HCCM complex-containing human faecal metagenome samples and obtained the sequence information covering almost the entire genome of each strain. Importantly, all were clade I strains, supporting our conclusion that H. cinaedi sensu stricto is a human-adapted lineage in the HCCM complex.","1":"Escherichia coli is often associated with urinary tract infection (UTI). Antibiotic resistance in E. coli is an ongoing challenge in managing UTI. Extrachromosomal elements - plasmids - are vectors for clinically relevant traits, such as antibiotic resistance, with conjugation being one of the main methods for horizontal propagation of plasmids in bacterial populations. Targeting of conjugation components has been proposed as a strategy to curb the spread of plasmid-borne antibiotic resistance. Understanding the types of conjugative systems present in urinary E. coli isolates is fundamental to assessing the viability of this strategy. In this study, we profile two well-studied conjugation systems (F-type and P-type) in the draft genomes of 65 urinary isolates of E. coli obtained from the bladder urine of adult women with and without UTI-like symptoms. Most of these isolates contained plasmids and we found that conjugation genes were abundant\/ubiquitous, diverse and often associated with IncF plasmids. To validate conjugation of these urinary plasmids, the plasmids from two urinary isolates, UMB1223 (predicted to have F-type genes) and UMB1284 (predicted to have P-type genes), were transferred by conjugation into the K-12 E. coli strain MG1655. Overall, the findings of this study support the notion that care should be taken in targeting any individual component of a urinary E. coli isolate's conjugation system, given the inherent mechanistic redundancy, gene diversity and different types of conjugation systems in this population.","2":"Small and intermediate-size noncoding RNAs (sRNAs and is-ncRNAs) have been shown to play important regulatory roles in the development of several eukaryotic organisms. However, they have not been thoroughly explored in Cryptosporidium parvum, an obligate zoonotic protist parasite responsible for the diarrhoeal disease cryptosporidiosis. Using Illumina sequencing of a small RNA library, a systematic identification of novel small and is-ncRNAs was performed in C. parvum excysted sporozoites. A total of 79 novel is-ncRNA candidates, including antisense, intergenic and intronic is-ncRNAs, were identified, including 7 new small nucleolar RNAs (snoRNAs). Expression of select novel is-ncRNAs was confirmed by RT-PCR. Phylogenetic conservation was analysed using covariance models (CMs) in related Cryptosporidium and apicomplexan parasite genome sequences. A potential new type of small ncRNA derived from tRNA fragments was observed. Overall, a deep profiling analysis of novel is-ncRNAs in C. parvum and related species revealed structural features and conservation of these novel is-ncRNAs. Covariance models can be used to detect is-ncRNA genes in other closely related parasites. These findings provide important new sequences for additional functional characterization of novel is-ncRNAs in the protist pathogen C. parvum.","3":null,"4":null,"5":null,"6":null,"7":null,"8":"Although Salmonella Derby ST71 strains have been recognized as poultry-specific by previous studies, multiple swine-associated S. Derby ST71 strains were identified in this long-term, multi-site epidemic study. Here, 15 representative swine-associated S. Derby ST71 strains were sequenced and compared with 65 (one swine-associated and 64 poultry-associated) S. Derby ST71 strains available in the NCBI database at a pangenomic level through comparative genomics analysis to identify genomic features related to the differentiation of swine-associated strains and previously reported poultry-associated strains. The distribution patterns of known Salmonella pathogenicity islands (SPIs) and virulence factor (VF) encoding genes were not capable of differentiating between the two strain groups. The results demonstrated that the S. Derby ST71 population harbours an open pan-genome, and swine-associated ST71 strains contain many more genes than the poultry-associated strains, mainly attributed to the prophage sequence contents in the genomes. The numbers of prophage sequences identified in the swine-associated strains were higher than those in the poultry-associated strains. Prophages specifically harboured by the swine-associated strains were found to contain genes that facilitate niche adaptation for the bacterial hosts. Gene deletion experiments revealed that the dam gene specifically present in the prophage of the swine-associated strains is important for S. Derby to adhere onto the host cells. This study provides novel insights into the roles of prophages during the genome differentiation of Salmonella.","9":null,"10":null,"11":"","12":"The transient upsurge of G2P[4] group A rotavirus (RVA) after Rotarix vaccine introduction in several countries has been a matter of concern. To gain insight into the diversity and evolution of G2P[4] strains in South Africa pre- and post-RVA vaccination introduction, whole-genome sequencing was performed for RVA positive faecal specimens collected between 2003 and 2017 and samples previously sequenced were obtained from GenBank (n=103; 56 pre- and 47 post-vaccine). Pre-vaccine G2 sequences predominantly clustered within sub-lineage IVa-1. In contrast, post-vaccine G2 sequences clustered mainly within sub-lineage IVa-3, whereby a radical amino acid (AA) substitution, S15F, was observed between the two sub-lineages. Pre-vaccine P[4] sequences predominantly segregated within sub-lineage IVa while post-vaccine sequences clustered mostly within sub-lineage IVb, with a radical AA substitution R162G. Both S15F and R162G occurred outside recognised antigenic sites. The AA residue at position 15 is found within the signal sequence domain of Viral Protein 7 (VP7) involved in translocation of VP7 into endoplasmic reticulum during infection process. The 162 AA residue lies within the hemagglutination domain of Viral Protein 4 (VP4) engaged in interaction with sialic acid-containing structure during attachment to the target cell. Free energy change analysis on VP7 indicated accumulation of stable point mutations in both antigenic and non-antigenic regions. The segregation of South African G2P[4] strains into pre- and post-vaccination sub-lineages is likely due to erstwhile hypothesized stepwise lineage\/sub-lineage evolution of G2P[4] strains rather than RVA vaccine introduction. Our findings reinforce the need for continuous whole-genome RVA surveillance and investigation of contribution of AA substitutions in understanding the dynamic G2P[4] epidemiology.","13":null,"14":"","15":"A hospital outbreak of carbapenem-resistant Enterobacterales was detected by routine surveillance. Whole genome sequencing and subsequent analysis revealed a conserved promiscuous bla OXA-48 carrying plasmid as the defining factor within this outbreak. Four different species of Enterobacterales were involved in the outbreak. Escherichia coli ST399 accounted for 35 of all the 55 isolates. Comparative genomics analysis using publicly available E. coli ST399 genomes showed that the outbreak E. coli ST399 isolates formed a unique clade. We developed a mathematical model of pOXA-48-like plasmid transmission between host lineages and used it to estimate its conjugation rate, giving a lower bound of 0.23 conjugation events per lineage per year. Our analysis suggests that co-evolution between the pOXA-48-like plasmid and E. coli ST399 could have played a role in the outbreak. This is the first study to report carbapenem-resistant E. coli ST399 carrying blaOXA-48 as the main cause of a plasmid-borne outbreak within a hospital setting. Our findings suggest complementary roles for both plasmid conjugation and clonal expansion in the emergence of this outbreak.","16":"Soybean is the most important legume cropped worldwide and can highly benefit from the biological nitrogen fixation (BNF) process. Brazil is recognized for its leadership in the use of inoculants and two strains, Bradyrhizobium japonicum CPAC 15 (=SEMIA 5079) and Bradyrhizobium diazoefficiens CPAC 7 (=SEMIA 5080) compose the majority of the 70 million doses of soybean inoculants commercialized yearly in the country. We studied a collection of natural variants of these two strains, differing in properties of competitiveness and efficiency of BNF. We sequenced the genomes of the parental strain SEMIA 566 of B. japonicum, of three natural variants of this strain (S 204, S 340 and S 370), and compared with another variant of this group, strain CPAC 15. We also sequenced the genome of the parental strain SEMIA 586 of B. diazoefficiens, of three natural variants of this strain (CPAC 390, CPAC 392 and CPAC 394) and compared with the genome of another natural variant, strain CPAC 7. As the main genes responsible for nodulation (nod, noe, nol) and BNF (nif, fix) in soybean Bradyrhizobium are located in symbiotic islands, our objective was to identify genetic variations located in this region, including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and insertions and deletions (indels), that could be potentially related to their different symbiotic phenotypes. We detected 44 genetic variations in the B. japonicum strains and three in B. diazoefficiens. As the B. japonicum strains have gone through a longer period of adaptation to the soil, the higher number of genetic variations could be explained by survival strategies under the harsh environmental conditions of the Brazilian Cerrado biome. Genetic variations were detected in genes enconding proteins such as a dephospho-CoA kinase, related to the CoA biosynthesis; a glucosamine-fructose-6-phosphate aminotransferase, key regulator of the hexosamine biosynthetic pathway; a LysR family transcriptional regulator related to nodulation genes; and NifE and NifS proteins, directly related to the BNF process. We suggest potential genetic variations related to differences in the symbiotic phenotypes.","17":null,"18":"","19":null,"20":"Linear plasmids are extrachromosomal DNA elements that have been found in a small number of bacterial species. To date, the only linear plasmids described in the family Enterobacteriaceae belong to Salmonella, first found in Salmonella enterica Typhi. Here, we describe a collection of 12 isolates of the Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex in which we identified linear plasmids. Screening of assembly graphs assembled from public read sets identified linear plasmid structures in a further 13 K. pneumoniae species complex genomes. We used these 25 linear plasmid sequences to query all bacterial genome assemblies in the National Center for Biotechnology Information database, and discovered an additional 61 linear plasmid sequences in a variety of Enterobacteriaceae species. Gene content analysis divided these plasmids into five distinct phylogroups, with very few genes shared across more than two phylogroups. The majority of linear plasmid-encoded genes are of unknown function; however, each phylogroup carried its own unique toxin-antitoxin system and genes with homology to those encoding the ParAB plasmid stability system. Passage in vitro of the 12 linear plasmid-carrying Klebsiella isolates in our collection (which include representatives of all five phylogroups) indicated that these linear plasmids can be stably maintained, and our data suggest they can transmit between K. pneumoniae strains (including members of globally disseminated multidrug-resistant clones) and also between diverse Enterobacteriaceae species. The linear plasmid sequences, and representative isolates harbouring them, are made available as a resource to facilitate future studies on the evolution and function of these novel plasmids.","21":null,"22":"","23":"Infections with globally disseminated Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) of the O113:H21 serotype can progress to severe clinical complications, such as hemolytic uremic syndrome (HUS). Two phylogeographically distinct clonal complexes have been established by multi locus sequence typing (MLST). Infections with ST-820 isolates circulating exclusively in Australia have caused severe human disease, such as HUS. Conversely, ST-223 isolates prevalent in the US and outside Australia seem to rarely cause severe human disease but are frequent contaminants. Following a genomic epidemiology approach, we wanted to gain insights into the underlying cause for this disparity. We examined the plasticity in the genome make-up and Shiga toxin production in a collection of 20 ST-820 and ST-223 strains isolated from produce, the bovine reservoir, and clinical cases. STEC are notorious for assembly into fragmented draft sequences when using short-read sequencing technologies due to the extensive and partly homologous phage complement. The application of long-read technology (LRT) sequencing yielded closed reference chromosomes and plasmids for two representative ST-820 and ST-223 strains. The established high-resolution framework, based on whole genome alignments, single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-typing and MLST, includes the chromosomes and plasmids of other publicly available O113:H21 sequences and allowed us to refine the phylogeographical boundaries of ST-820 and ST-223 complex isolates and to further identify a historic non-shigatoxigenic strain from Mexico as a quasi-intermediate. Plasmid comparison revealed strong correlations between the strains' featured pO113 plasmid genotypes and chromosomally inferred ST, which suggests coevolution of the chromosome and virulence plasmids. Our pathogenicity assessment revealed statistically significant differences in the Stx2a-production capabilities of ST-820 as compared to ST-223 strains under RecA-induced Stx phage mobilization, a condition that mimics Stx-phage induction. These observations suggest that ST-820 strains may confer an increased pathogenic potential in line with the strain-associated epidemiological metadata. Still, some of the tested ST-223 cultures sourced from contaminated produce or the bovine reservoir also produced Stx at levels comparable to those of ST-820 isolates, which calls for awareness and for continued surveillance of this lineage.","24":"","25":null,"26":null,"27":null,"28":"","29":null,"30":null,"31":null,"32":"A long-standing challenge in human microbiome research is achieving the taxonomic and functional resolution needed to generate testable hypotheses about the gut microbiota's impact on health and disease. With a growing number of live microbial interventions in clinical development, this challenge is renewed by a need to understand the pharmacokinetics and pharmacodynamics of therapeutic candidates. While short-read sequencing of the bacterial 16S rRNA gene has been the standard for microbiota profiling, recent improvements in the fidelity of long-read sequencing underscores the need for a re-evaluation of the value of distinct microbiome-sequencing approaches. We leveraged samples from participants enrolled in a phase 1b clinical trial of a novel live biotherapeutic product to perform a comparative analysis of short-read and long-read amplicon and metagenomic sequencing approaches to assess their utility for generating clinical microbiome data. Across all methods, overall community taxonomic profiles were comparable and relationships between samples were conserved. Comparison of ubiquitous short-read 16S rRNA amplicon profiling to long-read profiling of the 16S-ITS-23S rRNA amplicon showed that only the latter provided strain-level community resolution and insight into novel taxa. All methods identified an active ingredient strain in treated study participants, though detection confidence was higher for long-read methods. Read coverage from both metagenomic methods provided evidence of active-ingredient strain replication in some treated participants. Compared to short-read metagenomics, approximately twice the proportion of long reads were assigned functional annotations. Finally, compositionally similar bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes (MAGs) were recovered from short-read and long-read metagenomic methods, although a greater number and more complete MAGs were recovered from long reads. Despite higher costs, both amplicon and metagenomic long-read approaches yielded added microbiome data value in the form of higher confidence taxonomic and functional resolution and improved recovery of microbial genomes compared to traditional short-read methodologies.","33":null,"34":"The human gut microbiome has been extensively studied, yet the canine gut microbiome is still largely unknown. The availability of high-quality genomes is essential in the fields of veterinary medicine and nutrition to unravel the biological role of key microbial members in the canine gut environment. Our aim was to evaluate nanopore long-read metagenomics and Hi-C (high-throughput chromosome conformation capture) proximity ligation to provide high-quality metagenome-assembled genomes (HQ MAGs) of the canine gut environment. By combining nanopore long-read metagenomics and Hi-C proximity ligation, we retrieved 27 HQ MAGs and 7 medium-quality MAGs of a faecal sample of a healthy dog. Canine MAGs (CanMAGs) improved genome contiguity of representatives from the animal and human MAG catalogues - short-read MAGs from public datasets - for the species they represented: they were more contiguous with complete ribosomal operons and at least 18 canonical tRNAs. Both canine-specific bacterial species and gut generalists inhabit the dog's gastrointestinal environment. Most of them belonged to Firmicutes, followed by Bacteroidota and Proteobacteria. We also assembled one Actinobacteriota and one Fusobacteriota MAG. CanMAGs harboured antimicrobial-resistance genes (ARGs) and prophages and were linked to plasmids. ARGs conferring resistance to tetracycline were most predominant within CanMAGs, followed by lincosamide and macrolide ones. At the functional level, carbohydrate transport and metabolism was the most variable within the CanMAGs, and mobilome function was abundant in some MAGs. Specifically, we assigned the mobilome functions and the associated mobile genetic elements to the bacterial host. The CanMAGs harboured 50 bacteriophages, providing novel bacterial-host information for eight viral clusters, and Hi-C proximity ligation data linked the six potential plasmids to their bacterial host. Long-read metagenomics and Hi-C proximity ligation are likely to become a comprehensive approach to HQ MAG discovery and assignment of extra-chromosomal elements to their bacterial host. This will provide essential information for studying the canine gut microbiome in veterinary medicine and animal nutrition.","35":"Integrons are microbial genetic elements that can integrate mobile gene cassettes. They are mostly known for spreading antibiotic resistance cassettes among human pathogens. However, beyond clinical settings, gene cassettes encode an extraordinarily diverse range of functions important for bacterial adaptation. The recovery and sequencing of cassettes has promising applications, including: surveillance of clinically important genes, particularly antibiotic resistance determinants; investigating the functional diversity of integron-carrying bacteria; and novel enzyme discovery. Although gene cassettes can be directly recovered using PCR, there are no standardised methods for their amplification and, importantly, for validating sequences as genuine integron gene cassettes. Here, we present reproducible methods for the amplification, sequence processing, and validation of gene cassette amplicons from complex communities. We describe two different PCR assays that either amplify cassettes together with integron integrases, or gene cassettes together within cassette arrays. We compare the performance of Nanopore and Illumina sequencing, and present bioinformatic pipelines that filter sequences to ensure that they represent amplicons from genuine integrons. Using a diverse set of environmental DNAs, we show that our approach can consistently recover thousands of unique cassettes per sample and up to hundreds of different integron integrases. Recovered cassettes confer a wide range of functions, including antibiotic resistance, with as many as 300 resistance cassettes found in a single sample. In particular, we show that class one integrons are collecting and concentrating resistance genes out of the broader diversity of cassette functions. The methods described here can be applied to any environmental or clinical microbiome sample.","36":"","37":null,"38":null,"39":null,"40":"Cases of invasive group B streptococcal infection in the adult UK population have steadily increased over recent years, with the most common serotypes being V, III and Ia, but less is known of the genetic background of these strains. We have carried out in-depth analysis of the whole-genome sequences of 193 clinically important group B Streptococcus (GBS) isolates (184 were from invasive infection, 8 were from non-invasive infection and 1 had no information on isolation site) isolated from adults and submitted to the National Reference Laboratory at the UK Health Security Agency between January 2014 and December 2015. We have determined that capsular serotypes III (26.9%), Ia (26.4%) and V (15.0%) were most commonly identified, with slight differences in gender and age distribution. Most isolates (n=182) grouped to five clonal complexes (CCs), CC1, CC8\/CC10, CC17, CC19 and CC23, with common associations between specific serotypes and virulence genes. Additionally, we have identified large recombination events mediating potential capsular switching events between sequence type (ST)1 serotype V and serotypes Ib (n=2 isolates), II (n=2 isolates) and VI (n=2 isolates); between ST19 serotype III and serotype V (n=5 isolates); and between CC17 serotype III and serotype IV (n=1 isolate). The high genetic diversity of disease-causing isolates and multiple recombination events reported in this study highlight the need for routine surveillance of the circulating disease-causing GBS strains. This information is crucial to better understand the global spread of GBS serotypes and genotypes, and will form the baseline information for any future GBS vaccine research in the UK and worldwide.","41":"Fowl cholera caused by Pasteurella multocida has re-emerged in Australian poultry production since the increasing adoption of free-range production systems. Currently, autogenous killed whole-cell vaccines prepared from the isolates previously obtained from each farm are the main preventative measures used. In this study, we use whole-genome sequencing and phylogenomic analysis to investigate outbreak dynamics, as well as monitoring and comparing the variations in the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) outer core biosynthesis loci of the outbreak and vaccine strains. In total, 73 isolates from two different free-range layer farms were included. Our genomic analysis revealed that all investigated isolates within the two farms (layer A and layer B) carried LPS type L3, albeit with a high degree of genetic diversity between them. Additionally, the isolates belonged to five different sequence types (STs), with isolates belonging to ST9 and ST20 being the most prevalent. The isolates carried ST-specific mutations within their LPS type L3 outer core biosynthesis loci, including frameshift mutations in the outer core heptosyltransferase gene (htpE) (ST7 and ST274) or galactosyltransferase gene (gatG) (ST20). The ST9 isolates could be separated into three groups based on their LPS outer core biosynthesis loci sequences, with evidence for potential phase variation mechanisms identified. The potential phase variation mechanisms included a tandem repeat insertion in natC and a single base deletion in a homopolymer region of gatG. Importantly, our results demonstrated that two of the three ST9 groups shared identical rep-PCR (repetitive extragenic palindromic PCR) patterns, while carrying differences in their LPS outer core biosynthesis loci region. In addition, we found that ST9 isolates either with or without the natC tandem repeat insertion were both associated with a single outbreak, which would indicate the importance of screening more than one isolate within an outbreak. Our results strongly suggest the need for a metagenomics culture-independent approach, as well as a genetic typing scheme for LPS, to ensure an appropriate vaccine strain with a matching predicted LPS structure is used.","42":"Computational algorithms have become an essential component of research, with great efforts by the scientific community to raise standards on development and distribution of code. Despite these efforts, sustainability and reproducibility are major issues since continued validation through software testing is still not a widely adopted practice.

We have developed these recommendations based on our experience from a collaborative hackathon organised prior to the American Society for Microbiology Next Generation Sequencing (ASM NGS) 2020 conference. We also present a repository hosting examples and guidelines for testing, available from https:\/\/github.com\/microbinfie-hackathon2020\/CSIS.","43":"Salmonella Kentucky is commonly found in poultry and rarely associated with human disease. However, a multidrug-resistant (MDR) S. Kentucky clone [sequence type (ST)198] has been increasingly reported globally in humans and animals. Our aim here was to assess if the recently reported increase of S. Kentucky in poultry in Spain was associated with the ST198 clone and to characterize this MDR clone and its distribution in Spain. Sixty-six isolates retrieved from turkey, laying hen and broiler in 2011-2017 were subjected to whole-genome sequencing to assess their sequence type, genetic relatedness, and presence of antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs), plasmid replicons and virulence factors. Thirteen strains were further analysed using long-read sequencing technologies to characterize the genetic background associated with ARGs. All isolates belonged to the ST198 clone and were grouped in three clades associated with the presence of a specific point mutation in the gyrA gene, their geographical origin and isolation year. All strains carried between one and 16 ARGs whose presence correlated with the resistance phenotype to between two and eight antimicrobials. The ARGs were located in the Salmonella genomic island (SGI-1) and in some cases (bla SHV-12 , catA1, cmlA1, dfrA and multiple aminoglycoside-resistance genes) in IncHI2\/IncI1 plasmids, some of which were consistently detected in different years\/farms in certain regions, suggesting they could persist over time. Our results indicate that the MDR S. Kentucky ST198 is present in all investigated poultry hosts in Spain, and that certain strains also carry additional plasmid-mediated ARGs, thus increasing its potential public health significance.","44":null,"45":null,"46":null,"47":"Mitis group Streptococcus are human obligate bacteria residing in the nasopharynx and oral cavity. They comprise both commensal and pathogenic species with the most well-known being Streptococcus pneumoniae - a leading cause of meningitis and pneumonia. A primary difference between the commensal and pathogenic species is the presence of the polysaccharide capsule - a major virulence factor in S. pneumoniae, also present in other commensal species. Our current understanding of the evolutionary divergence of the pathogenic and commensal species has been inferred from extant strains. Ancient genomes can further elucidate streptococcal evolutionary history. We extracted streptococcal genome reads from a 5700-year-old ancient metagenome and worked towards characterizing them. Due to excessive within- and between-species recombination common among streptococci we were unable to parse individual species. Further, the composite reads of the ancient metagenome do not fit within the diversity of any specific extant species. Using a capsular gene database and AT-content analysis we determined that this ancient metagenome is missing polysaccharide synthesis genes integral to streptococcal capsule formation. The presence of multiple zinc metalloproteases suggests that adaptation to host IgA1 had begun and the presence of other virulence factors further implies development of close host-microbe interactions, though the absence of a capsule suggests an inability to cause invasive disease. The presence of specific virulence factors such as pneumolysin implies stable maintenance of such genes through streptococcal evolution that may strengthen their value as anti-pneumococcal vaccine antigens, while maintaining awareness of their potential presence in commensal species. Following from Jensen et al.'s initial analysis we provide historical context for this long time human nasopharyngeal resident, the Mitis group Streptococcus.","48":"Vibrio fluvialis is a food-borne pathogen with epidemic potential that causes cholera-like acute gastroenteritis and sometimes extraintestinal infections in humans. However, research on its genetic diversity and pathogenicity-related genetic elements based on whole genome sequences is lacking. In this study, we collected and sequenced 130 strains of V. fluvialis from 14 provinces of China, and also determined the susceptibility of 35 of the strains to 30 different antibiotics. Combined with 52 publicly available V. fluvialis genomes, we inferred the population structure and investigated the characteristics of pathogenicity-related factors. The V. fluvialis strains exhibited high levels of homologous recombination and were assigned to two major populations, VflPop1 and VflPop2, according to the different compositions of their gene pools. VflPop2 was subdivided into groups 2.1 and 2.2. Except for VflPop2.2, which consisted only of Asian strains, the strains in VflPop1 and VflPop2.1 were distributed in the Americas, Asia and Europe. Analysis of the pathogenicity potential of V. fluvialis showed that most of the identified virulence-related genes or gene clusters showed high prevalence in V. fluvialis, except for three mobile genetic elements: pBD146, ICEVflInd1 and MGIVflInd1, which were scattered in only a few strains. A total of 21 antimicrobial resistance genes were identified in the genomes of the 182 strains analysed in this study, and 19 (90%) of them were exclusively present in VflPop2. Notably, the tetracycline resistance-related gene tet(35) was present in 150 (95%) of the strains in VflPop2, and in only one (4%) strain in VflPop1, indicating it was population-specific. In total, 91% of the 35 selected strains showed resistance to cefazolin, indicating V. fluvialis has a high resistance rate to cefazolin. Among the 15 genomes that carried the previously reported drug resistance-related plasmid pBD146, 11 (73%) showed resistance to trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, which we inferred was related to the presence of the dfr6 gene in the plasmid. On the basis of the population genomics analysis, the genetic diversity, population structure and distribution of pathogenicity-related factors of V. fluvialis were delineated in this study. The results will provide further clues regarding the evolution and pathogenic mechanisms of V. fluvialis, and improve our knowledge for the prevention and control of this pathogen.","49":null,"50":"Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae is a Gram-negative, rod-shaped bacterium of the family Pasteurellaceae causing pig pleuropneumonia associated with great economic losses worldwide. Nineteen serotypes with distinctive lipopolysaccharide (LPS) and capsular (CPS) compositions have been described so far, yet complete circular genomes are publicly available only for the reference strains of serotypes 1, 4 and 5b, and for field strains of serotypes 1, 3, 7 and 8. We aimed to complete this picture by sequencing the reference strains of 17 different serotypes with the MinION sequencer (Oxford Nanopore Technologies, ONT) and on an Illumina HiSeq (Illumina) platform. We also included two field isolates of serotypes 2 and 3 that were PacBio- and MinION-sequenced, respectively. Genome assemblies were performed following two different strategies, i.e. PacBio- or ONT-only de novo assemblies polished with Illumina reads or a hybrid assembly by directly combining ONT and Illumina reads. Both methods proved successful in obtaining accurate circular genomes with comparable qualities. blast-based genome comparisons and core-genome phylogeny based on core genes, SNP typing and multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) of the 26 circular genomes indicated well-conserved genomes across the 18 different serotypes, differing mainly in phage insertions, and CPS, LPS and RTX-toxin clusters, which, consistently, encode serotype-specific antigens. We also identified small antibiotic resistance plasmids, and complete subtype I-F and subtype II-C CRISPR-Cas systems. Of note, highly similar clusters encoding all those serotype-specific traits were also found in other pathogenic and commensal Actinobacillus species. Taken together with the presence of transposable elements surrounding these loci, we speculate a dynamic intra- and interspecies exchange of such virulence-related factors by horizontal gene transfer. In conclusion, our comprehensive genomics analysis provides useful information for diagnostic test and vaccine development, but also for whole-genome-based epidemiological studies, as well as for the surveillance of the evolution of antibiotic resistance and virulence genes in A. pleuropneumoniae.","51":"The evolution of Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S.

The emergence of passerine-adapted S. Typhimurium in Europe and North America raises questions regarding its evolutionary origin. Here, we demonstrated that the UK and US passerine-adapted S. Typhimurium shared a common ancestor from ca. 1838, and larids played a key role in the clonal expansion by disseminating the common ancestor between North America and Europe. Further, we identified virulence gene signatures common in the passerine- and larid-adapted S. Typhimurium, including conserved pseudogenes in fimbrial gene lpfD and Type 3 Secretion System (T3SS) effector gene steC. However, the UK and US passerine-adapted S. Typhimurium also possessed unique virulence gene signatures (i.e. pseudogenes in fimbrial gene fimC and T3SS effector genes sspH2, gogB, sseJ and sseK2), and the majority of them (38\/47) lost a virulence plasmid pSLT that was present in the larid-adapted S. Typhimurium. These results provide evidence that passerine-adapted S. Typhimurium share a common ancestor with those from larids, and the divergence of passerine- and larid-adapted S. Typhimurium might be due to pseudogenization or loss of specific virulence genes.","52":null,"53":null,"54":null,"55":null,"56":null,"57":"Streptococcus mitis is a Gram-positive bacterium, member of the oral commensal microbiota, which can occasionally be the etiologic agent of diseases such as infective endocarditis, bacteraemia and septicaemia. The highly recombinogenic and repetitive nature of the S. mitis genome impairs the assembly of a complete genome relying only on short sequencing reads. Oxford Nanopore sequencing can overcome this limitation by generating long reads, enabling the resolution of genomic repeated regions and the assembly of a complete genome sequence. Since the output of a Nanopore sequencing run is strongly influenced by genomic DNA quality and molecular weight, the DNA isolation is the crucial step for an optimal sequencing run. In the present work, we have set up and compared three DNA isolation methods on two S. mitis strains, evaluating their capability of preserving genomic DNA integrity and purity. Sequencing of DNA isolated with a mechanical lysis-based method, despite being cheaper and quicker, did not generate ultra-long reads (maximum read length of 59516 bases) and did not allow the assembly of a circular complete genome. Two methods based on enzymatic lysis of the bacterial cell wall, followed by either (i) a modified CTAB DNA isolation procedure, or (ii) a DNA purification after osmotic lysis of the protoplasts allowed the sequencing of ultra-long reads up to 107294 and 181199 bases in length, respectively. The reconstruction of a circular complete genome was possible sequencing DNAs isolated using the enzymatic lysis-based methods.","58":null,"59":"Clostridioides difficile is a pathogen often associated with hospital-acquired infection or antimicrobial-induced disease; however, increasing evidence indicates infections can result from community or environmental sources. Most genomic sequencing of C. difficile has focused on clinical strains, although evidence is growing that C. difficile spores are widespread in soil and water in the environment. In this study, we sequenced 38 genomes collected from soil and water isolates in Flagstaff (AZ, USA) and Slovenia in an effort targeted towards environmental surveillance of C. difficile. At the average nucleotide identity (ANI) level, the genomes were divergent to C. difficile at a threshold consistent with different species. A phylogenetic analysis of these divergent genomes together with Clostridioides genomes available in public repositories confirmed the presence of three previously described, cryptic Clostridioides species and added two additional clades. One of the cryptic species (C-III) was almost entirely composed of Arizona and Slovenia genomes, and contained distinct sub-groups from each region (evidenced by SNP and gene-content differences). A comparative genomics analysis identified multiple unique coding sequences per clade, which can serve as markers for subsequent environmental surveys of these cryptic species. Homologues to the C. difficile toxin genes, tcdA and tcdB, were found in cryptic species genomes, although they were not part of the typical pathogenicity locus observed in C. difficile, and in silico PCR suggested that some would not amplify with widely used PCR diagnostic tests. We also identified gene homologues in the binary toxin cluster, including some present on phage and, for what is believed to be the first time, on a plasmid. All isolates were obtained from environmental samples, so the function and disease potential of these toxin homologues is currently unknown. Enzymatic profiles of a subset of cryptic isolates (n=5) demonstrated differences, suggesting that these isolates contain substantial metabolic diversity. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) was observed across a subset of isolates (n=4), suggesting that AMR mechanisms are intrinsic to the genus, perhaps originating from a shared environmental origin. This study greatly expands our understanding of the genomic diversity of Clostridioides. These results have implications for C. difficile One Health research, for more sensitive C. difficile diagnostics, as well as for understanding the evolutionary history of C. difficile and the development of pathogenesis.","60":"Members of the genus Clostridium are frequently associated with meat spoilage. The ability for low numbers of spores of certain Clostridium species to germinate in cold-stored vacuum-packed meat can result in blown pack spoilage. However, little is known about the germination process of these clostridia, despite this characteristic being important for their ability to cause spoilage. This study sought to determine the genomic conditions for germination of 37 representative Clostridium strains from seven species (C. estertheticum, C. tagluense, C. frigoris, C. gasigenes, C. putrefaciens, C. aligidicarnis and C. frigdicarnis) by comparison with previously characterized germination genes from C. perfringens, C. sporogenes and C. botulinum. All the genomes analysed contained at least one gerX operon. Seven different gerX operon configuration types were identified across genomes from C. estertheticum, C. tagluense and C. gasigenes. Differences arose between the C. gasigenes genomes and those belonging to C. tagluense\/C. estertheticum in the number and type of genes coding for cortex lytic enzymes, suggesting the germination pathway of C. gasigenes is different. However, the core components of the germination pathway were conserved in all the Clostridium genomes analysed, suggesting that these species undergo the same major steps as Bacillus subtilis for germination to occur.","61":null,"62":"Acinetobacter baumannii is a critically important pathogen known for its widespread antibiotic resistance and ability to persist in hospital-associated environments. Whilst the majority of A. baumannii infections are hospital-acquired, infections from outside the hospital have been reported with high mortality. Despite this, little is known about the natural environmental reservoir(s) of A. baumannii and the virulence potential underlying non-clinical strains. Here, we report the complete genome sequences of six diverse strains isolated from environments such as river, soil, and industrial sites around the world. Phylogenetic analyses showed that four of these strains were unrelated to representative nosocomial strains and do not share a monophyletic origin, whereas two had sequence types belonging to the global clone lineages GC1 and GC2. Further, the majority of these strains harboured genes linked to virulence and stress protection in nosocomial strains. These genotypic properties correlated well with in vitro virulence phenotypic assays testing resistance to abiotic stresses, serum survival, and capsule formation. Virulence potential was confirmed in vivo, with most environmental strains able to effectively kill Galleria mellonella greater wax moth larvae. Using phenomic arrays and antibiotic resistance profiling, environmental and nosocomial strains were shown to have similar substrate utilisation patterns although environmental strains were distinctly more sensitive to antibiotics. Taken together, these features of environmental A. baumannii strains suggest the existence of a strain-specific distinct gene pools for niche specific adaptation. Furthermore, environmental strains appear to be equally virulent as contemporary nosocomial strains but remain largely antibiotic sensitive.","63":null,"64":null,"65":null,"66":null,"67":"Cystic fibrosis (CF) and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) are characterized by increasingly frequent acute pulmonary exacerbations that reduce life quality and length. Human airways are home to a rich polymicrobial environment, which includes members of the obligately anaerobic genus Prevotella. Despite their commonness, surprisingly little is known about the prevalence, role, genomic diversity and antimicrobial resistance (AMR) potential of Prevotella species and strains in healthy and diseased airways. Here, we used comparative genomics to develop a real-time PCR assay to permit rapid Prevotella species identification and quantification from cultures and clinical specimens. Assay specificity was validated across a panel of Prevotella and non-Prevotella species, followed by PCR screening of CF and COPD respiratory-derived cultures. Next, 35 PCR-positive isolates were subjected to whole-genome sequencing. Of eight identified Prevotella species, P. histicola, P. melaninogenica, P. nanceiensis, P. salivae and P. denticola overlapped between participant cohorts. Phylogenomic analysis revealed considerable interhost but limited intrahost diversity, suggesting patient-specific lineages in the lower airways, probably from oral cavity aspirations. Correlation of phenotypic AMR profiles with AMR genes identified excellent correlation between tetQ presence and decreased doxycycline susceptibility, and ermF presence and decreased azithromycin susceptibility and clindamycin resistance. AMR rates were higher in the CF isolates, reflecting greater antibiotic use in this cohort. All tested Prevotella isolates were tobramycin-resistant, providing a potential selection method to improve Prevotella culture retrieval rates. Our addition of 35 airway-derived Prevotella genomes to public databases will enhance ongoing efforts to unravel the role of this diverse and enigmatic genus in both diseased and healthy lungs.","68":"Carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii are prevalent in low- and middle-income countries such as Egypt, but little is known about the molecular epidemiology and mechanisms of resistance in these settings. Here, we characterize carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii from Alexandria, Egypt, and place it in a regional context. Fifty-four carbapenem-resistant isolates from Alexandria Main University Hospital (AMUH), Alexandria, Egypt, collected between 2010 and 2015 were genome sequenced using Illumina technology. Genomes were de novo assembled and annotated. Genomes for 36 isolates from the Middle East region were downloaded from GenBank. The core-gene compliment was determined using Roary, and analyses of recombination were performed in Gubbins. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) sequence type (ST) and antibiotic-resistance genes were identified. The majority of Egyptian isolates belonged to one of three major clades, corresponding to Pasteur MLST clonal complex (CCPAS) 1, CCPAS2 and STPAS158. Strains belonging to STPAS158 have been reported almost exclusively from North Africa, the Middle East and Pakistan, and may represent a region-specific lineage. All isolates carried an oxa23 gene, six carried bla NDM-1 and one carried bla NDM-2. The oxa23 gene was located on a variety of different mobile elements, with Tn2006 predominant in CCPAS2 strains, and Tn2008 predominant in other lineages. Of particular concern, in 8 of the 13 CCPAS1 strains, the oxa23 gene was located in a temperate bacteriophage phiOXA, previously identified only once before in a CCPAS1 clone from the USA military. The carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii population in AMUH is very diverse, and indicates an endemic circulating population, including a region-specific lineage. A major mechanism for oxa23 dissemination in CCPAS1 isolates appears to be a bacteriophage, presenting new concerns about the ability of these carbapenemases to spread throughout the bacterial population.","69":"The eighth Applied Bioinformatics and Public Health Microbiology (ABPHM) conference showcased the recent acceleration of bioinformatic approaches used in public health settings. This included approaches for the surveillance of infectious diseases, understanding microbial evolution and diversity and pathogen interactions. Overall, the meeting highlighted the importance of data-driven approaches used by scientists during the COVID-19 pandemic.","70":"Macrolides are broad-spectrum antibiotics used to treat a range of infections. Resistance to macrolides is often conferred by mobile resistance genes encoding Erm methyltransferases or Mph phosphotransferases. New erm and mph genes keep being discovered in clinical settings but their origins remain unknown, as is the type of macrolide resistance genes that will appear in the future. In this study, we used optimized hidden Markov models to characterize the macrolide resistome. Over 16 terabases of genomic and metagenomic data, representing a large taxonomic diversity (11 030 species) and diverse environments (1944 metagenomic samples), were searched for the presence of erm and mph genes. From this data, we predicted 28 340 macrolide resistance genes encoding 2892 unique protein sequences, which were clustered into 663 gene families (&lt;70 % amino acid identity), of which 619 (94 %) were previously uncharacterized. This included six new resistance gene families, which were located on mobile genetic elements in pathogens. The function of ten predicted new resistance genes were experimentally validated in Escherichia coli using a growth assay. Among the ten tested genes, seven conferred increased resistance to erythromycin, with five genes additionally conferring increased resistance to azithromycin, showing that our models can be used to predict new functional resistance genes. Our analysis also showed that macrolide resistance genes have diverse origins and have transferred horizontally over large phylogenetic distances into human pathogens. This study expands the known macrolide resistome more than ten-fold, provides insights into its evolution, and demonstrates how computational screening can identify new resistance genes before they become a significant clinical problem.","71":"Whooping cough, the respiratory disease caused by Bordetella pertussis, has undergone a wide-spread resurgence over the last several decades. Previously, we developed a pipeline to assemble the repetitive B. pertussis genome into closed sequences using hybrid nanopore and Illumina sequencing. Here, this sequencing pipeline was used to conduct a more high-throughput, longitudinal screen of 66 strains isolated between 1982 and 2018 in New Zealand. New Zealand has a higher incidence of whooping cough than many other countries; usually at least twice as many cases per 100000 people as the USA and UK and often even higher, despite similar rates of vaccine uptake. To the best of our knowledge, these strains are the first New Zealand B. pertussis isolates to be sequenced. The analyses here show that, on the whole, genomic trends in New Zealand B. pertussis isolates, such as changing allelic profile in vaccine-related genes and increasing pertactin deficiency, have paralleled those seen elsewhere in the world. At the same time, phylogenetic comparisons of the New Zealand isolates with global isolates suggest that a number of strains are circulating in New Zealand, which cluster separately from other global strains, but which are closely related to each other. The results of this study add to a growing body of knowledge regarding recent changes to the B. pertussis genome, and are the first genetic investigation into B. pertussis isolates from New Zealand.","72":null,"73":"","74":"Antimicrobial resistance (AR) is a major global threat to public health. Understanding the population dynamics of AR is critical to restrain and control this issue. However, no study has provided a global picture of the whole resistome of Acinetobacter baumannii, a very important nosocomial pathogen. Here we analyse 1450+ genomes (covering &gt;40 countries and &gt;4 decades) to infer the global population dynamics of the resistome of this species. We show that gene flow and horizontal transfer have driven the dissemination of AR genes in A. baumannii. We found considerable variation in AR gene content across lineages. Although the individual AR gene histories have been affected by recombination, the AR gene content has been shaped by the phylogeny. Furthermore, many AR genes have been transferred to other well-known pathogens, such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Klebsiella pneumoniae. Despite using this massive data set, we were not able to sample the whole diversity of AR genes, which suggests that this species has an open resistome. Our results highlight the high mobilization risk of AR genes between important pathogens. On a broader perspective, this study gives a framework for an emerging perspective (resistome-centric) on the genomic epidemiology (and surveillance) of bacterial pathogens.","75":"Staphylococcus haemolyticus is a species of coagulase-negative staphylococci that has primarily been studied as a human skin microbiome member and an emerging nosocomial pathogen. Here, we present the first complete genome of S. haemolyticus strains SE3.9, SE3.8 and SE2.14 reported as an endophyte of rice seed. Detailed investigation of the genome dynamics of strains from diverse origins revealed an expanded genome size in clinical isolates, and a role of many insertion sequence (IS) elements in strain diversification. Interestingly, several of the IS elements are also unique or enriched in a particular habitat. Comparative studies also revealed the potential movement of mobile elements from rice endophytic S. haemolyticus to strains from other pathogenic species such as Staphylococcus aureus. The study highlights the importance of ecological studies in the systematic understanding of genome plasticity and management of medically important Staphylococcus species.","76":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the most important health threats globally. The ability to accurately identify resistant bacterial isolates and the individual antimicrobial resistance genes (ARGs) is essential for understanding the evolution and emergence of AMR and to provide appropriate treatment. The rapid developments in next-generation sequencing technologies have made this technology available to researchers and microbiologists at routine laboratories around the world. However, tools available for those with limited experience with bioinformatics are lacking, especially to enable researchers and microbiologists in low- and middle-income countries (LMICs) to perform their own studies. The CGE-tools (Center for Genomic Epidemiology) including ResFinder (https:\/\/cge.cbs.dtu.dk\/services\/ResFinder\/) was developed to provide freely available easy to use online bioinformatic tools allowing inexperienced researchers and microbiologists to perform simple bioinformatic analyses. The main purpose was and is to provide these solutions for people involved in frontline diagnosis especially in LMICs. Since its original publication in 2012, ResFinder has undergone a number of improvements including improvement of the code and databases, inclusion of point mutations for selected bacterial species and predictions of phenotypes also for selected species. As of 28 September 2021, 820 803 analyses have been performed using ResFinder from 61 776 IP-addresses in 171 countries. ResFinder clearly fulfills a need for several people around the globe and we hope to be able to continue to provide this service free of charge in the future. We also hope and expect to provide further improvements including phenotypic predictions for additional bacterial species.","77":"The development of spots or lesions symptomatic of common scab on root and tuber crops is caused by few pathogenic Streptomyces with Streptomyces scabiei 87-22 as the model species. Thaxtomin phytotoxins are the primary virulence determinants, mainly acting by impairing cellulose synthesis, and their production in S. scabiei is in turn boosted by cello-oligosaccharides released from host plants. In this work we aimed to determine which molecules and which biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) of the specialized metabolism of S. scabiei 87-22 show a production and\/or a transcriptional response to cello-oligosaccharides. Comparative metabolomic analyses revealed that molecules of the virulome of S. scabiei induced by cellobiose and cellotriose include (i) thaxtomin and concanamycin phytotoxins, (ii) desferrioxamines, scabichelin and turgichelin siderophores in order to acquire iron essential for housekeeping functions, (iii) ectoine for protection against osmotic shock once inside the host, and (iv) bottromycin and concanamycin antimicrobials possibly to prevent other microorganisms from colonizing the same niche. Importantly, both cello-oligosaccharides reduced the production of the spore germination inhibitors germicidins thereby giving the 'green light' to escape dormancy and trigger the onset of the pathogenic lifestyle. For most metabolites - either with induced or reduced production - cellotriose was revealed to be a slightly stronger elicitor compared to cellobiose, supporting an earlier hypothesis which suggested the trisaccharide was the real trigger for virulence released from the plant cell wall through the action of thaxtomins. Interestingly, except for thaxtomins, none of these BGCs' expression seems to be under direct control of the cellulose utilization repressor CebR suggesting the existence of a yet unknown mechanism for switching on the virulome. Finally, a transcriptomic analysis revealed nine additional cryptic BGCs that have their expression awakened by cello-oligosaccharides, suggesting that other and yet to be discovered metabolites could be part of the virulome of S. scabiei.","78":"Increasing evidence of regional pathogen transmission networks highlights the importance of investigating the dissemination of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) across a region to identify where transmission is occurring and how pathogens move across regions. We developed a framework for investigating MDRO regional transmission dynamics using whole-genome sequencing data and created regentrans, an easy-to-use, open source R package that implements these methods (https:\/\/github.com\/Snitkin-Lab-Umich\/regentrans). Using a dataset of over 400 carbapenem-resistant isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae collected from patients in 21 long-term acute care hospitals over a one-year period, we demonstrate how to use our framework to gain insights into differences in inter- and intra-facility transmission across different facilities and over time. This framework and corresponding R package will allow investigators to better understand the origins and transmission patterns of MDROs, which is the first step in understanding how to stop transmission at the regional level.","79":null,"80":null,"81":"Rhizosphere colonization by bacteria involves molecular and cellular mechanisms, such as motility and chemotaxis, biofilm formation, metabolic versatility, or biosynthesis of secondary metabolites, among others. Nonetheless, there is limited knowledge concerning the main regulatory factors that drive the rhizosphere colonization process. Here we show the importance of the AmrZ and FleQ transcription factors for adaption in the plant growth-promoting rhizobacterium (PGPR) and rhizosphere colonization model Pseudomonas ogarae F113. RNA-Seq analyses of P. ogarae F113 grown in liquid cultures either in exponential and stationary growth phase, and rhizosphere conditions, revealed that rhizosphere is a key driver of global changes in gene expression in this bacterium. Regarding the genetic background, this work has revealed that a mutation in fleQ causes considerably more alterations in the gene expression profile of this bacterium than a mutation in amrZ under rhizosphere conditions. The functional analysis has revealed that in P. ogarae F113, the transcription factors AmrZ and FleQ regulate genes involved in diverse bacterial functions. Notably, in the rhizosphere, these transcription factors antagonistically regulate genes related to motility, biofilm formation, nitrogen, sulfur, and amino acid metabolism, transport, signalling, and secretion, especially the type VI secretion systems. These results define the regulon of two important bifunctional transcriptional regulators in pseudomonads during the process of rhizosphere colonization.","82":null,"83":"Since the discovery of haemolysis, many studies focused on a deeper understanding of this phenotype in Escherichia coli and its association with other virulence genes, diseases and pathogenic attributes\/functions in the host. Our virulence-associated factor profiling and genome-wide association analysis of genomes of haemolytic and nonhaemolytic E. coli unveiled high prevalence of adhesins, iron acquisition genes and toxins in haemolytic bacteria. In the case of fimbriae with high prevalence, we analysed sequence variation of FimH, EcpD and CsgA, and showed that different adhesin variants were present in the analysed groups, indicating altered adhesive capabilities of haemolytic and nonhaemolytic E. coli. Analysis of over 1000 haemolytic E. coli genomes revealed that they are pathotypically, genetically and antigenically diverse, but their adhesin and iron acquisition repertoire is associated with genome placement of hlyCABD cluster. Haemolytic E. coli with chromosome-encoded alpha-haemolysin had high frequency of P, S, Auf fimbriae and multiple iron acquisition systems such as aerobactin, yersiniabactin, salmochelin, Fec, Sit, Bfd and hemin uptake systems. Haemolytic E. coli with plasmid-encoded alpha-haemolysin had similar adhesin profile to nonpathogenic E. coli, with high prevalence of Stg, Yra, Ygi, Ycb, Ybg, Ycf, Sfm, F9 fimbriae, Paa, Lda, intimin and type 3 secretion system encoding genes. Analysis of HlyCABD sequence variation revealed presence of variants associated with genome placement and pathotype.","84":"Uropathogenic Escherichia coli (UPEC) UTI89 is a well-characterized strain, which has mainly been used to study UPEC virulence during urinary tract infection (UTI). However, little is known on UTI89 key fitness-factors during growth in lab media and during UTI. Here, we used a transposon-insertion-sequencing approach (TraDIS) to reveal the UTI89 essential-genes for in vitro growth and fitness-gene-sets for growth in Luria broth (LB) and EZ-MOPS medium without glucose, as well as for human bacteriuria and mouse cystitis. A total of 293 essential genes for growth were identified and the set of fitness-genes was shown to differ depending on the growth media. A modified, previously validated UTI murine model, with administration of glucose prior to infection was applied. Selected fitness-genes for growth in urine and mouse-bladder colonization were validated using deletion-mutants. Novel fitness-genes, such as tusA, corA and rfaG; involved in sulphur-acquisition, magnesium-uptake, and LPS-biosynthesis, were proved to be important during UTI. Moreover, rfaG was confirmed as relevant in both niches, and therefore it may represent a target for novel UTI-treatment\/prevention strategies.","85":null,"86":"A rapid and accurate diagnostic assay represents an important means to detect Mycobacterium tuberculosis, identify drug-resistant strains and ensure treatment success. Currently employed techniques to diagnose drug-resistant tuberculosis include slow phenotypic tests or more rapid molecular assays that evaluate a limited range of drugs. Whole-genome-sequencing-based approaches can detect known drug-resistance-conferring mutations and novel variations; however, the dependence on growing samples in culture, and the associated delays in achieving results, represents a significant limitation. As an alternative, targeted sequencing strategies can be directly performed on clinical samples at high throughput. This study proposes a targeted sequencing assay to rapidly detect drug-resistant strains of M. tuberculosis using the Nanopore MinION sequencing platform. We designed a single-tube assay that targets nine genes associated with drug resistance to seven drugs and two phylogenetic-determining regions to determine strain lineage and tested it in nine clinical isolates and six sputa. The study's main aim is to calibrate MinNION variant calling to detect drug-resistance-associated mutations with different frequencies to match the accuracy of Illumina (the current gold-standard sequencing technology) from both culture and sputum samples. After calibrating Nanopore MinION variant calling, we demonstrated 100% agreement between Illumina WGS and our MinION set up to detect known drug resistance and phylogenetic variants in our dataset. Importantly, other variants in the amplicons are also detected, decreasing the recall. We identify minority variants and insertions\/deletions as crucial bioinformatics challenges to fully reproduce Illumina WGS results.","87":null,"88":null,"89":null,"90":"Clostridioides difficile (formerly Clostridium difficile) colonizes the gastrointestinal tract following disruption of the microbiota and can initiate a spectrum of clinical manifestations ranging from asymptomatic to life-threatening colitis. Following antibiotic treatment, luminal oxygen concentrations increase, exposing gut microbes to potentially toxic reactive oxygen species. Though typically regarded as a strict anaerobe, C. difficile can grow at low oxygen concentrations. How this bacterium adapts to a microaerobic environment and whether those responses to oxygen are conserved amongst strains is not entirely understood. Here, two C. difficile strains (630 and CD196) were cultured in 1.5% oxygen and the transcriptional response to long-term oxygen exposure was evaluated via RNA-sequencing. During growth in a microaerobic environment, several genes predicted to protect against oxidative stress were upregulated, including those for rubrerythrins and rubredoxins. Transcription of genes involved in metal homeostasis was also positively correlated with increased oxygen levels and these genes were amongst the most differentially transcribed. To directly compare the transcriptional landscape between C. difficile strains, a 'consensus-genome' was generated. On the basis of the identified conserved genes, basal transcriptional differences as well as variations in the response to oxygen were evaluated. While several responses were similar between the strains, there were significant differences in the abundance of transcripts involved in amino acid and carbohydrate metabolism. Furthermore, intracellular metal concentrations significantly varied both in an oxygen-dependent and oxygen-independent manner. Overall, these results indicate that C. difficile adapts to grow in a low oxygen environment through transcriptional changes, though the specific strategy employed varies between strains.","91":"","92":null,"93":null,"94":"Shigella flexneri serotype 6 is an understudied cause of diarrhoeal diseases in developing countries, and has been proposed as one of the major targets for vaccine development against shigellosis. Despite being named as S. flexneri, Shigella flexneri serotype 6 is phylogenetically distinct from other S. flexneri serotypes and more closely related to S. boydii. This unique phylogenetic relationship and its low sampling frequency have hampered genomic research on this pathogen. Herein, by utilizing whole genome sequencing (WGS) and analyses of Shigella flexneri serotype 6 collected from epidemiological studies (1987-2013) in four Asian countries, we revealed its population structure and evolutionary history in the region. Phylogenetic analyses supported the delineation of Asian Shigella flexneri serotype 6 into two phylogenetic groups (PG-1 and -2). Notably, temporal phylogenetic approaches showed that extant Asian S. flexneri serotype 6 could be traced back to an inferred common ancestor arising in the 18th century. The dominant lineage PG-1 likely emerged in the 1970s, which coincided with the times to most recent common ancestors (tMRCAs) inferred from other major Southeast Asian S. flexneri serotypes. Similar to other S. flexneri serotypes in the same period in Asia, genomic analyses showed that resistance to first-generation antimicrobials was widespread, while resistance to more recent first-line antimicrobials was rare. These data also showed a number of gene inactivation and gene loss events, particularly on genes related to metabolism and synthesis of cellular appendages, emphasizing the continuing role of reductive evolution in the adaptation of the pathogen to an intracellular lifestyle. Together, our findings reveal insights into the genomic evolution of the understudied Shigella flexneri serotype 6, providing a new piece in the puzzle of Shigella epidemiology and evolution.","95":"Polyketide synthases (PKSs) and non-ribosomal peptide synthetases (NRPSs) are mega enzymes responsible for the biosynthesis of a large fraction of natural products (NPs). Molecular markers for biosynthetic genes, such as the ketosynthase (KS) domain of PKSs, have been used to assess the diversity and distribution of biosynthetic genes in complex microbial communities. More recently, metagenomic studies have complemented and enhanced this approach by allowing the recovery of complete biosynthetic gene clusters (BGCs) from environmental DNA. In this study, the distribution and diversity of biosynthetic genes and clusters from Arctic Ocean samples (NICE-2015 expedition), was assessed using PCR-based strategies coupled with high-throughput sequencing and metagenomic analysis. In total, 149 KS domain OTU sequences were recovered, 36 % of which could not be assigned to any known BGC. In addition, 74 bacterial metagenome-assembled genomes were recovered, from which 179 BGCs were extracted. A network analysis identified potential new NP families, including non-ribosomal peptides and polyketides. Complete or near-complete BGCs were recovered, which will enable future heterologous expression efforts to uncover the respective NPs. Our study represents the first report of biosynthetic diversity assessed for Arctic Ocean metagenomes and highlights the potential of Arctic Ocean planktonic microbiomes for the discovery of novel secondary metabolites. The strategy employed in this study will enable future bioprospection, by identifying promising samples for bacterial isolation efforts, while providing also full-length BGCs for heterologous expression.","96":"Extra-intestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli (ExPEC) ST1193, a globally emergent fluoroquinolone-resistant clone, has become an important cause of bloodstream infections (BSIs) associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Previous studies have reported the emergence of fluoroquinolone-resistant ExPEC ST1193 in Vietnam; however, limited data exist regarding the genetic structure, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) determinants and transmission dynamics of this pandemic clone. Here, we performed genomic and phylogenetic analyses of 46 ST1193 isolates obtained from BSIs and healthy individuals in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam, to investigate the pathogen population structure, molecular mechanisms of AMR and potential transmission patterns. We further examined the phylogenetic structure of ST1193 isolates in a global context. We found that the endemic E. coli ST1193 population was heterogeneous and highly dynamic, largely driven by multiple strain importations. Several well-supported phylogenetic clusters (C1-C6) were identified and associated with distinct bla CTX-M variants, including bla CTXM-27 (C1-C3, C5), bla CTXM-55 (C4) and bla CTXM-15 (C6). Most ST1193 isolates were multidrug-resistant and carried an extensive array of AMR genes. ST1193 isolates also exhibited the ability to acquire further resistance while circulating in Vietnam. There were phylogenetic links between ST1193 isolates from BSIs and healthy individuals, suggesting these organisms may both establish long-term colonization in the human intestinal tract and induce infections. Our study uncovers factors shaping the population structure and transmission dynamics of multidrug-resistant ST1193 in Vietnam, and highlights the urgent need for local One Health genomic surveillance to capture new emerging ExPEC clones and to better understand the origins and transmission patterns of these pathogens.","97":null,"98":null,"99":"The economically important plant pathogen Xylella fastidiosa has been reported in multiple regions of the globe during the last two decades, threatening a growing list of plants. Particularly, X. fastidiosa subspecies fastidiosa causes Pierce's disease (PD) of grapevines, which is a problem in the USA, Spain, and Taiwan. In this work, we studied PD-causing subsp. fastidiosa populations and compared the genome sequences of 33 isolates found in Central Taiwan with 171 isolates from the USA and two from Spain. Phylogenetic relationships, haplotype networks, and genetic diversity analyses confirmed that subsp. fastidiosa was recently introduced into Taiwan from the Southeast USA (i.e. the PD-I lineage). Recent core-genome recombination events were detected among introduced subsp. fastidiosa isolates in Taiwan and contributed to the development of genetic diversity. The genetic diversity observed includes contributions through recombination from unknown donors, suggesting that higher genetic diversity exists in the region. Nevertheless, no recombination event was detected between X. fastidiosa subsp. fastidiosa and the endemic sister species Xylella taiwanensis, which is the causative agent of pear leaf scorch disease. In summary, this study improved our understanding of the genetic diversity of an important plant pathogenic bacterium after its invasion to a new region.","100":null,"101":"Group B Streptococcus (GBS; Streptococcus agalactiae) is the most common cause of neonatal meningitis and a rising cause of sepsis in adults. Recently, it has also been shown to cause foodborne disease. As with many other bacteria, the polysaccharide capsule of GBS is antigenic, enabling its use for strain serotyping. Recent advances in DNA sequencing have made sequence-based typing attractive (as has been implemented for several other bacteria, including Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae species complex, Streptococcus pyogenes, and others). For GBS, existing WGS-based serotyping systems do not provide complete coverage of all known GBS serotypes (specifically including subtypes of serotype III), and none are simultaneously compatible with the two most common data types, raw short reads and assembled sequences. Here, we create a serotyping database (GBS-SBG, GBS Serotyping by Genome Sequencing), with associated scripts and running instructions, that can be used to call all currently described GBS serotypes, including subtypes of serotype III, using both direct short-read- and assembly-based typing. We achieved higher concordance using GBS-SBG on a previously reported data set of 790 strains. We further validated GBS-SBG on a new set of 572 strains, achieving 99.8% concordance with PCR-based molecular serotyping using either short-read- or assembly-based typing. The GBS-SBG package is publicly available and will hopefully accelerate and simplify serotyping by sequencing for GBS.","102":"Powdery mildews comprise a large group of economically important phytopathogenic fungi.

Included in the comparative analysis was also the mitochondrial genome of Erysiphe necator that was previously analysed. The mitochondrial genomes of the four Erysiphales exhibit a similar gene content and organization but a large variation in size, with sizes ranging from 109800 bp in B. graminis f. sp. tritici to 332165 bp in G. cichoracearum, which is the largest mitochondrial genome of a fungal pathogen reported to date. Further comparative analysis revealed an unusual bimodal GC distribution in the mitochondrial genomes of B. graminis f. sp. tritici and G. cichoracearum that was not previously observed in fungi. The cytochrome b (cob) genes of E. necator, E. pisi, and G. cichoracearum were also exceptionally rich in introns, which in turn harboured rare open reading frames encoding reverse transcriptases that were likely acquired horizontally. Golovinomyces cichoracearum had also the longest cob gene (45 kb) among 703 fungal cob genes analysed. Collectively, these results provide novel insights into the organization of mitochondrial genomes of powdery mildew pathogens and represent valuable resources for population genetics and evolutionary studies.","103":"Beta-proteobacteria belonging to the genus Acidovorax have been described from various environments. Many strains can interact with a range of hosts, including humans and plants, forming neutral, beneficial or detrimental associations. In the frame of this study, we investigated the genomic properties of 52 bacterial strains of the genus Acidovorax, isolated from healthy roots of Lotus japonicus, with the intent of identifying traits important for effective plant-growth promotion. Based on single-strain inoculation bioassays with L. japonicus, performed in a gnotobiotic system, we distinguished seven robust plant-growth promoting strains from strains with no significant effects on plant-growth. We showed that the genomes of the two groups differed prominently in protein families linked to sensing and transport of organic acids, production of phytohormones, as well as resistance and production of compounds with antimicrobial properties. In a second step, we compared the genomes of the tested isolates with those of plant pathogens and free-living strains of the genus Acidovorax sourced from public repositories. Our pan-genomics comparison revealed features correlated with commensal and pathogenic lifestyle. We showed that commensals and pathogens differ mostly in their ability to use plant-derived lipids and in the type of secretion-systems being present. Most free-living Acidovorax strains did not harbour any secretion-systems. Overall, our data indicate that Acidovorax strains undergo extensive adaptations to their particular lifestyle by horizontal uptake of novel genetic information and loss of unnecessary genes.","104":"Shigella and enteroinvasive Escherichia coli (EIEC) cause human bacillary dysentery with similar invasion mechanisms and share similar physiological, biochemical and genetic characteristics. Differentiation of Shigella from EIEC is important for clinical diagnostic and epidemiological investigations. However, phylogenetically, Shigella and EIEC strains are composed of multiple clusters and are different forms of E. coli, making it difficult to find genetic markers to discriminate between Shigella and EIEC. In this study, we identified 10 Shigella clusters, seven EIEC clusters and 53 sporadic types of EIEC by examining over 17000 publicly available Shigella and EIEC genomes. We compared Shigella and EIEC accessory genomes to identify cluster-specific gene markers for the 17 clusters and 53 sporadic types. The cluster-specific gene markers showed 99.64% accuracy and more than 97.02% specificity. In addition, we developed a freely available in silico serotyping pipeline named Shigella EIEC Cluster Enhanced Serotype Finder (ShigEiFinder) by incorporating the cluster-specific gene markers and established Shigella and EIEC serotype-specific O antigen genes and modification genes into typing. ShigEiFinder can process either paired-end Illumina sequencing reads or assembled genomes and almost perfectly differentiated Shigella from EIEC with 99.70 and 99.74% cluster assignment accuracy for the assembled genomes and read mapping respectively. ShigEiFinder was able to serotype over 59 Shigella serotypes and 22 EIEC serotypes and provided a high specificity of 99.40% for assembled genomes and 99.38% for read mapping for serotyping. The cluster-specific gene markers and our new serotyping tool, ShigEiFinder (installable package: https:\/\/github.com\/LanLab\/ShigEiFinder, online tool: https:\/\/mgtdb.unsw.edu.au\/ShigEiFinder\/), will be useful for epidemiological and diagnostic investigations.","105":"Drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the causative agent of tuberculosis disease, arises from genetic mutations in genes coding for drug-targets or drug-converting enzymes. SNPs linked to drug resistance have been extensively studied and form the basis of molecular diagnostics and sequencing-based resistance profiling. However, alternative forms of functional variation such as large deletions and other loss of function (LOF) mutations have received much less attention, but if incorporated into diagnostics they are likely to improve their predictive performance. Our work aimed to characterize the contribution of LOF mutations found in 42 established drug resistance genes linked to 19 anti-tuberculous drugs across 32689 sequenced clinical isolates. The analysed LOF mutations included large deletions (n=586), frameshifts (n=4764) and premature stop codons (n=826). We found LOF mutations in genes strongly linked to pyrazinamide (pncA), isoniazid (katG), capreomycin (tlyA), streptomycin (e.g. gid) and ethionamide (ethA, mshA) (P&lt;10-5), but also in some loci linked to drugs where relatively less phenotypic data is available [e.g. cycloserine, delaminid, bedaquiline, para-aminosalicylic acid (PAS), and clofazimine]. This study reports that large deletions (median size 1115 bp) account for a significant portion of resistance variants found for PAS (+7.1% of phenotypic resistance percentage explained), pyrazinamide (+3.5%) and streptomycin (+2.6%) drugs, and can be used to improve the prediction of cryptic resistance. Overall, our work highlights the importance of including LOF mutations (e.g. large deletions) in predicting genotypic drug resistance, thereby informing tuberculosis infection control and clinical decision-making.","106":null,"107":null,"108":"Escherichia albertii is a recently recognized species in the genus Escherichia that causes diarrhoea. The population structure, genetic diversity and genomic features have not been fully examined. Here, 169 E. albertii isolates from different sources and regions in China were sequenced and combined with 312 publicly available genomes (from additional 14 countries) for genomic analyses. The E. albertii population was divided into two clades and eight lineages, with lineage 3 (L3), L5 and L8 more common in China. Clinical isolates were observed in all clades\/lineages. Virulence genes were found to be distributed differently among lineages: subtypes of the intimin encoding gene eae and the cytolethal distending toxin gene cdtB were lineage associated, and the second type three secretion system (ETT2) island was truncated in L3 and L6. Seven new eae subtypes and one new cdtB subtype (cdtB-VI) were identified. Alarmingly, 85.9 % of the Chinese E. albertii isolates were predicted to be multidrug-resistant (MDR) with 35.9 % harbouring genes capable of conferring resistance to 10 to 14 different drug classes. The majority of the MDR isolates were of poultry source from China and belonged to four sequence types (STs) [ST4638, ST4479, ST4633 and ST4488]. Thirty-four plasmids with some carrying MDR and virulence genes, and 130 prophages were identified from 17 complete E. albertii genomes. The 130 intact prophages were clustered into five groups, with group five prophages harbouring more virulence genes. We further identified three E. albertii specific genes as markers for the identification of this species. Our findings provided fundamental insights into the population structure, virulence variation and drug resistance of E. albertii.","109":"Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) are foodborne pathogens causing serious diseases, such as haemorrhagic colitis and haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Although O157:H7 STEC strains have been the most prevalent, incidences of STEC infections by several other serotypes have recently increased. O121:H19 STEC is one of these major non-O157 STECs, but systematic whole genome sequence (WGS) analyses have not yet been conducted on this STEC. Here, we performed a global WGS analysis of 638 O121:H19 strains, including 143 sequenced in this study, and a detailed comparison of 11 complete genomes, including four obtained in this study. By serotype-wide WGS analysis, we found that O121:H19 strains were divided into four lineages, including major and second major lineages (named L1 and L3, respectively), and that the locus of enterocyte effacement (LEE) encoding a type III secretion system (T3SS) was acquired by the common ancestor of O121:H19. Analyses of 11 complete genomes belonging to L1 or L3 revealed remarkable interlineage differences in the prophage pool and prophage-encoded T3SS effector repertoire, independent acquisition of virulence plasmids by the two lineages, and high conservation in the prophage repertoire, including that for Stx2a phages in lineage L1. Further sequence determination of complete Stx2a phage genomes of 49 strains confirmed that Stx2a phages in lineage L1 are highly conserved short-tailed phages, while those in lineage L3 are long-tailed lambda-like phages with notable genomic diversity, suggesting that an Stx2a phage was acquired by the common ancestor of L1 and has been stably maintained. Consistent with these genomic features of Stx2a phages, most lineage L1 strains produced much higher levels of Stx2a than lineage L3 strains. Altogether, this study provides a global phylogenetic overview of O121:H19 STEC and shows the interlineage genomic differences and the highly conserved genomic features of the major lineage within this serotype of STEC.","110":"Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole are used commonly together as cotrimoxazole for the treatment of urinary tract and other infections. The evolution of resistance to these and other antibacterials threatens therapeutic options for clinicians. We generated and analysed a chemical-biology-whole-genome data set to predict new targets for antibacterial combinations with trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. For this we used a large transposon mutant library in Escherichia coli BW25113 where an outward-transcribing inducible promoter was engineered into one end of the transposon. This approach allows regulated expression of adjacent genes in addition to gene inactivation at transposon insertion sites, a methodology that has been called TraDIS-Xpress. These chemical genomic data sets identified mechanisms for both reduced and increased susceptibility to trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole. The data identified that over-expression of FolA reduced trimethoprim susceptibility, a known mechanism for reduced susceptibility. In addition, transposon insertions into the genes tdk, deoR, ybbC, hha, ldcA, wbbK and waaS increased susceptibility to trimethoprim and likewise for rsmH, fadR, ddlB, nlpI and prc with sulfamethoxazole, while insertions in ispD, uspC, minC, minD, yebK, truD and umpG increased susceptibility to both these antibiotics. Two of these genes' products, Tdk and IspD, are inhibited by AZT and fosmidomycin respectively, antibiotics that are known to synergise with trimethoprim. Thus, the data identified two known targets and several new target candidates for the development of co-drugs that synergise with trimethoprim, sulfamethoxazole or cotrimoxazole. We demonstrate that the TraDIS-Xpress technology can be used to generate information-rich chemical-genomic data sets that can be used for antibacterial development.","111":"Mycobacterium abscessus is a rapid growing, free-living species of bacterium that also causes lung infections in humans. Human infections are usually acquired from the environment; however, dominant circulating clones (DCCs) have emerged recently in both M. abscessus subsp. massiliense and subsp. abscessus that appear to be transmitted among humans and are now globally distributed. These recently emerged clones are potentially informative about the ecological and evolutionary mechanisms of pathogen emergence and host adaptation. The geographical distribution of DCCs has been reported, but the genomic processes underlying their transition from environmental bacterium to human pathogen are not well characterized. To address this knowledge gap, we delineated the structure of M. abscessus subspecies abscessus and massiliense using genomic data from 200 clinical isolates of M. abscessus from seven geographical regions. We identified differences in overall patterns of lateral gene transfer (LGT) and barriers to LGT between subspecies and between environmental and host-adapted bacteria. We further characterized genome reorganization that accompanied bacterial host adaptation, inferring selection pressures acting at both genic and intergenic loci. We found that both subspecies encode an expansive pangenome with many genes at rare frequencies. Recombination appears more frequent in M. abscessus subsp. massiliense than in subsp. abscessus, consistent with prior reports. We found evidence suggesting that phage are exchanged between subspecies, despite genetic barriers evident elsewhere throughout the genome. Patterns of LGT differed according to niche, with less LGT observed among host-adapted DCCs versus environmental bacteria. We also found evidence suggesting that DCCs are under distinct selection pressures at both genic and intergenic sites. Our results indicate that host adaptation of M. abscessus was accompanied by major changes in genome evolution, including shifts in the apparent frequency of LGT and impacts of selection. Differences were evident among the DCCs as well, which varied in the degree of gene content remodelling, suggesting they were placed differently along the evolutionary trajectory toward host adaptation. These results provide insight into the evolutionary forces that reshape bacterial genomes as they emerge into the pathogenic niche.","112":null,"113":"Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic pathogen that is difficult to treat due to its resistance to extreme conditions, including desiccation and antibiotics. Most strains causing outbreaks around the world belong to two main global lineages, namely global clones 1 and 2 (GC1 and GC2). Here, we used a combination of Illumina short read and MinION (Oxford Nanopore) long-read sequence data with a hybrid assembly approach to complete the genome sequence of two antibiotic-sensitive GC1 strains, Ex003 and Ax270, recovered in Lebanon from water and a rectal swab of a cat, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis of Ax270 and Ex003 with 186 publicly available GC1 genomes revealed two major clades, including five main lineages (L1-L5), and four single-isolate lineages outside of the two clades. Ax270 and Ex003, along with AB307-0294 and MRSN7213 (both predicted antibiotic-susceptible isolates) represent these individual lineages. Antibiotic resistance islands and transposons interrupting the comM gene remain important features in L1-L5, with L1 associated with the AbaR-type resistance islands, L2 with AbaR4, L3 strains containing either AbaR4 or its variants as well as Tn6022::ISAba42, and L4 and L5 associated with Tn6022 or its variants. Analysis of the capsule (KL) and outer core (OCL) polysaccharide loci further revealed a complex evolutionary history probably involving many recombination events. As more genomes become available, more GC1 lineages continue to emerge. However, genome sequence data from more diverse geographical regions are needed to draw a more accurate population structure of this globally distributed clone.","114":null,"115":null,"116":"","117":null,"118":"","119":null,"120":"Antimicrobial-resistance (AMR) genes in bacteria are often carried on plasmids and these plasmids can transfer AMR genes between bacteria. For molecular epidemiology purposes and risk assessment, it is important to know whether the genes are located on highly transferable plasmids or in the more stable chromosomes. However, draft whole-genome sequences are fragmented, making it difficult to discriminate plasmid and chromosomal contigs. Current methods that predict plasmid sequences from draft genome sequences rely on single features, like k-mer composition, circularity of the DNA molecule, copy number or sequence identity to plasmid replication genes, all of which have their drawbacks, especially when faced with large single-copy plasmids, which often carry resistance genes. With our newly developed prediction tool RFPlasmid, we use a combination of multiple features, including k-mer composition and databases with plasmid and chromosomal marker proteins, to predict whether the likely source of a contig is plasmid or chromosomal. The tool RFPlasmid supports models for 17 different bacterial taxa, including Campylobacter, Escherichia coli and Salmonella, and has a taxon agnostic model for metagenomic assemblies or unsupported organisms. RFPlasmid is available both as a standalone tool and via a web interface.","121":"Genome-wide association studies (GWASs) can reveal genetic variations associated with a phenotype in the absence of any hypothesis of candidate genes. The problem of false-positive sites linked with the responsible site might be bypassed in bacteria with a high homologous recombination rate, such as Helicobacter pylori, which causes gastric cancer. We conducted a small-sample GWAS (125 gastric cancer cases and 115 controls) followed by prediction of gastric cancer and control (duodenal ulcer) H. pylori strains. We identified 11 single nucleotide polymorphisms (eight amino acid changes) and three DNA motifs that, combined, allowed effective disease discrimination. They were often informative of the underlying molecular mechanisms, such as electric charge alteration at the ligand-binding pocket, alteration in subunit interaction, and mode-switching of DNA methylation. We also identified three novel virulence factors\/oncoprotein candidates. These results provide both defined targets for further informatic and experimental analyses to gain insights into gastric cancer pathogenesis and a basis for identifying a set of biomarkers for distinguishing these H. pylori-related diseases.","122":"Understanding the evolution of the SARS-CoV-2 virus in various regions of the world during the Covid-19 pandemic is essential to help mitigate the effects of this devastating disease. We describe the phylogenomic and population genetic patterns of the virus in Mexico during the pre-vaccination stage, including asymptomatic carriers. A real-time quantitative PCR screening and phylogenomic reconstructions directed at sequence\/structure analysis of the spike glycoprotein revealed mutation of concern E484K in genomes from central Mexico, in addition to the nationwide prevalence of the imported variant 20C\/S:452R (B.1.427\/9). Overall, the detected variants in Mexico show spike protein mutations in the N-terminal domain (i.e. R190M), in the receptor-binding motif (i.e. T478K, E484K), within the S1-S2 subdomains (i.e. P681R\/H, T732A), and at the basis of the protein, V1176F, raising concerns about the lack of phenotypic and clinical data available for the variants of interest we postulate: 20B\/478K.V1 (B.1.1.222 or B.1.1.519) and 20B\/P.4 (B.1.1.28.4). Moreover, the population patterns of single nucleotide variants from symptomatic and asymptomatic carriers obtained with a self-sampling scheme confirmed the presence of several fixed variants, and differences in allelic frequencies among localities. We identified the mutation N:S194L of the nucleocapsid protein associated with symptomatic patients. Phylogenetically, this mutation is frequent in Mexican sub-clades. Our results highlight the dual and complementary role of spike and nucleocapsid proteins in adaptive evolution of SARS-CoV-2 to their hosts and provide a baseline for specific follow-up of mutations of concern during the vaccination stage.","123":null,"124":null,"125":null,"126":"","127":"We report here the complete genome sequence of the widely studied Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae serovar 8 reference strain 405, generated using the Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) RS II platform.

However, sequences of two small plasmids, pARD3079 and p405tetH, detected by Illumina sequencing of the draft genomes were not identified in the PacBio sequence of the reference strain.","128":"This study aimed to provide efficient recognition of bacterial strains on personal computers from MinION (Nanopore) long read data. Thanks to the fall in sequencing costs, the identification of bacteria can now proceed by whole genome sequencing. MinION is a fast, but highly error-prone sequencing device and it is a challenge to successfully identify the strain content of unknown simple or complex microbial samples. It is heavily constrained by memory management and fast access to the read and genome fragments. Our strategy involves three steps: indexing of known genomic sequences for a given or several bacterial species; a request process to assign a read to a strain by matching it to the closest reference genomes; and a final step looking for a minimum set of strains that best explains the observed reads. We have applied our method, called ORI, on 77 strains of Streptococcus thermophilus. We worked on several genomic distances and obtained a detailed classification of the strains, together with a criterion that allows merging of what we termed 'sibling' strains, only separated by a few mutations. Overall, isolated strains can be safely recognized from MinION data. For mixtures of several non-sibling strains, results depend on strain abundance.","129":"Staphylococcus aureus is a major bacterial pathogen in humans, and a dominant cause of severe bloodstream infections. Globally, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in S. aureus remains challenging. While human risk factors for infection have been defined, contradictory evidence exists for the role of bacterial genomic variation in S. aureus disease. To investigate the contribution of bacterial lineage and genomic variation to the development of bloodstream infection, we undertook a genome-wide association study comparing bacteria from 1017 individuals with bacteraemia to 984 adults with asymptomatic S. aureus nasal carriage. Within 984 carriage isolates, we also compared healthcare-associated (HA) carriage with community-associated (CA) carriage. All major global lineages were represented in both bacteraemia and carriage, with no evidence for different infection rates. However, kmers tagging trimethoprim resistance-conferring mutation F99Y in dfrB were significantly associated with bacteraemia-vs-carriage (P=10-8.9-10-9.3). Pooling variation within genes, bacteraemia-vs-carriage was associated with the presence of mecA (HMP=10-5.3) as well as the presence of SCCmec (HMP=10-4.4). Among S. aureus carriers, no lineages were associated with HA-vs-CA carriage. However, we found a novel signal of HA-vs-CA carriage in the foldase protein prsA, where kmers representing conserved sequence allele were associated with CA carriage (P=10-7.1-10-19.4), while in gyrA, a ciprofloxacin resistance-conferring mutation, L84S, was associated with HA carriage (P=10-7.2). In an extensive study of S. aureus bacteraemia and nasal carriage in the UK, we found strong evidence that all S. aureus lineages are equally capable of causing bloodstream infection, and of being carried in the healthcare environment. Genomic variation in the foldase protein prsA is a novel genomic marker of healthcare origin in S. aureus but was not associated with bacteraemia. AMR determinants were associated with both bacteraemia and healthcare-associated carriage, suggesting that AMR increases the propensity not only to survive in healthcare environments, but also to cause invasive disease.","130":null,"131":"","132":"","133":null,"134":"Competitive behaviours of plant growth promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) are integral to their ability to colonize and persist on plant roots and outcompete phytopathogenic fungi, oomycetes and bacteria. PGPR engage in a range of antagonistic behaviours that have been studied in detail, such as the production and secretion of compounds inhibitory to other microbes. In contrast, their defensive activities that enable them to tolerate exposure to inhibitory compounds produced by their neighbours are less well understood. In this study, the genes involved in the Pseudomonas protegens Pf-5 response to metabolites from eight diverse rhizosphere competitor organisms, Fusarium oxysporum, Rhizoctonia solani, Gaeumannomyces graminis var. tritici, Pythium spinosum, Bacillus subtilis QST713, Pseudomonas sp. Q2-87, Streptomyces griseus and Streptomyces bikiniensis subspecies bikiniensi, were examined. Proximity induced excreted metabolite responses were confirmed for Pf-5 with all partner organisms through HPLC before culturing a dense Pf-5 transposon mutant library adjacent to each of these microbes. This was followed by transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS), which identified genes that influence Pf-5 fitness during these competitive interactions. A set of 148 genes was identified that were associated with increased fitness during competition, including cell surface modification, electron transport, nucleotide metabolism, as well as regulatory genes. In addition, 51 genes were identified for which loss of function resulted in fitness gains during competition. These included genes involved in flagella biosynthesis and cell division. Considerable overlap was observed in the set of genes observed to provide a fitness benefit during competition with all eight test organisms, indicating commonalities in the competitive response to phylogenetically diverse micro-organisms and providing new insight into competitive processes likely to take place in the rhizosphere.","135":null,"136":null,"137":"Biofilms complete a life cycle where cells aggregate, grow and produce a structured community before dispersing to colonize new environments. Progression through this life cycle requires temporally controlled gene expression to maximize fitness at each stage. Previous studies have largely focused on identifying genes essential for the formation of a mature biofilm; here, we present an insight into the genes involved at different stages of biofilm formation. We used TraDIS-Xpress, a massively parallel transposon mutagenesis approach using transposon-located promoters to assay the impact of disruption or altered expression of all genes in the genome on biofilm formation. We identified 48 genes that affected the fitness of cells growing in a biofilm, including genes with known roles and those not previously implicated in biofilm formation. Regulation of type 1 fimbriae and motility were important at all time points, adhesion and motility were important for the early biofilm, whereas matrix production and purine biosynthesis were only important as the biofilm matured. We found strong temporal contributions to biofilm fitness for some genes, including some where expression changed between being beneficial or detrimental depending on the stage at which they are expressed, including dksA and dsbA. Novel genes implicated in biofilm formation included zapE and truA involved in cell division, maoP in chromosome organization, and yigZ and ykgJ of unknown function. This work provides new insights into the requirements for successful biofilm formation through the biofilm life cycle and demonstrates the importance of understanding expression and fitness through time.","138":"Genomic epidemiology is a tool for tracing transmission of pathogens based on whole-genome sequencing.

Following the closure of its genome sequence, we compared unusual telomeres from this organism with the other five classes of replicon ends found amongst streptomycetes. Closed replicons of streptomycete chromosomes were organized with respect to their phylogeny and physical orientation, which demonstrated that different telomeres were not associated with particular clades and are likely shared amongst different strains by plasmid-driven horizontal gene transfer. Furthermore, we identified a ~50 kb origin island with conserved synteny that is located at the core of all streptomycete chromosomes and forms an axis around which symmetrical chromosome inversions can take place. Despite this chromosomal bilateral symmetry, a bias in parS sites to the right of oriC is maintained across the family Streptomycetaceae and suggests that the formation of ParB\/parS nucleoprotein complexes on the right replichore is a conserved feature in streptomycetes. Consequently, our studies reveal novel features of linear bacterial replicons that, through their manipulation, may lead to improvements in growth and productivity of this important industrial group of bacteria.","140":"","141":null,"142":"Microbial organisms have diverse populations, where using a single linear reference sequence in comparative studies introduces reference-bias in downstream analyses, and leads to a failure to account for variability in the population. Recently, pan-genome graphs have emerged as an alternative to the traditional linear reference with many successful applications and a rapid increase in the number of methods available in the literature. Despite this enthusiasm, there has been no attempt at exploring these graph construction methods in depth, demonstrating their practical use. In this study, we aim to develop a general guide to help researchers who may want to incorporate pan-genomes in their analyses of microbial organisms. We evaluated the state-of-the art pan-genome construction tools to model a collection of 70 Acinetobacter baumannii strains. Our results suggest that all tools produced pan-genome graphs conforming to our expectations based on previous literature, and that their approach to homologue detection is likely to be the most influential in determining the final size and complexity of the pan-genome. The graphs overlapped most in the core pan-genome content while the cloud genes varied significantly among tools. We propose an alternative approach for pan-genome construction by combining two of the tools, Panaroo and Ptolemy, to further exploit them in downstream analyses, and demonstrate the effectiveness of our pipeline for structural variant calling in beta-lactam resistance genes in the same set of A. baumannii isolates, identifying various transposon structures for carbapenem resistance in chromosome, as well as plasmids.

As well as introducing genes that can contribute to the virulence of a strain, prophage can enable the generation of large-chromosomal rearrangements (LCRs) by homologous recombination. This work examines the types and frequencies of LCRs across the major lineages of the O157:H7 serotype. We demonstrate that LCRs are a major source of genomic variation across all lineages of E. coli O157:H7 and by using both optical mapping and Oxford Nanopore long-read sequencing prove that LCRs are generated in laboratory cultures started from a single colony and that these variants can be recovered from colonized cattle. LCRs are biased towards the terminus region of the genome and are bounded by specific prophages that share large regions of sequence homology associated with the recombinational activity. RNA transcriptional profiling and phenotyping of specific structural variants indicated that important virulence phenotypes such as Shiga-toxin production, type-3 secretion and motility can be affected by LCRs. In summary, E. coli O157:H7 has acquired multiple prophage regions over time that act to continually produce structural variants of the genome. These findings raise important questions about the significance of this prophage-mediated genome contingency to enhance adaptability between environments.","145":"The vast majority of described prokaryotic viruses have double-stranded or single-stranded DNA or double-stranded RNA genomes.

Several recent metagenomic and metatranscriptomic studies revealed a vastly greater diversity of these viruses in prokaryotic soil communities than ever anticipated. Phylogenetic analysis of these newly discovered viruses prompted the reorganization of class Allassoviricetes, now renamed Leviviricetes, to include two orders, Norzivirales and Timlovirales, and a total of six families, 428 genera and 882 species. Here we outline the new taxonomy of Leviviricetes, approved and ratified in 2021 by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses, and describe open-access hidden Markov models to accommodate the anticipated identification and future classification of hundreds, if not thousands, of additional class members into this new taxonomic framework.","146":null,"147":"Command-line annotation software tools have continuously gained popularity compared to centralized online services due to the worldwide increase of sequenced bacterial genomes.

Annotation results are exported in GFF3 and International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC)-compliant flat files, as well as comprehensive JSON files, facilitating automated downstream analysis. We compared Bakta to other rapid contemporary command-line annotation software tools in both targeted and taxonomically broad benchmarks including isolates and metagenomic-assembled genomes. We demonstrated that Bakta outperforms other tools in terms of functional annotations, the assignment of functional categories and database cross-references, whilst providing comparable wall-clock runtimes.

We conducted the first phylogenomic analysis of the T. rubrum species complex by studying 3105 core genes of 18 new strains from the BCCM\/IHEM culture collection and nine publicly available genomes. Our analyses revealed a highly resolved phylogenomic tree with six separate clades. Trichophyton rubrum, T. violaceum and T. soudanense were confirmed in their status of species. The morphotypes T. megninii, T. kuryangei and T. yaoundei all grouped in their own respective clade with high support, suggesting that these morphotypes should be reinstituted to the species-level. Robinson-Foulds distance analyses showed that a combination of two markers (a ubiquitin-protein transferase and a MYB DNA-binding domain-containing protein) can mirror the phylogeny obtained using genomic data, and thus represent potential new markers to accurately distinguish the species belonging to the T. rubrum complex.","150":null,"151":"","152":"","153":"","154":"We investigated the evolution, phylogeny and antimicrobial resistance of Vibrio cholerae O1 isolates (VCO1) from Ghana. Outbreak and environmental sources of VCO1 were characterized, whole-genome sequenced and compared to globally available seventh pandemic (7P) strains of V. cholerae at SNP resolution. Final analyses included 636 isolates. Novel Ghanaian isolates clustered into three distinct clades (clades 1, 2 and 3) in wave 3 of the 7P lineage. The closest relatives of our novel Ghanaian isolates were from Benin, Cameroon, Togo, Niger and Nigeria. All novel Ghanaian isolates were multi-drug resistant. Environmental isolates clustered into clade 2, despite being isolated years later, showing the possibility of persistence and re-emergence of older clades. A lag phase of several years from estimated introduction to reported cases suggests pathogen persistence in the absence of reported cholera cases. These results highlight the importance of deeper surveillance for understanding transmission routes between bordering countries and planning tailored vaccination campaigns in an effort to eradicate cholera.","155":"","156":"Neisseria meningitidis, the meningococcus, resides exclusively in humans and causes invasive meningococcal disease (IMD). The population of N. meningitidis is structured into stable clonal complexes by limited horizontal recombination in this naturally transformable species. N. meningitidis is an opportunistic pathogen, with some clonal complexes, such as cc53, effectively acting as commensal colonizers, while other genetic lineages, such as cc11, are rarely colonizers but are over-represented in IMD and are termed hypervirulent. This study examined theoretical evolutionary pathways for pathogenic and commensal lineages by examining the prevalence of horizontally acquired genomic islands (GIs) and loss-of-function (LOF) mutations. Using a collection of 4850 genomes from the BIGSdb database, we identified 82 GIs in the pan-genome of 11 lineages (10 hypervirulent and one commensal lineage). A new computational tool, Phaser, was used to identify frameshift mutations, which were examined for statistically significant association with genetic lineage. Phaser identified a total of 144 frameshift loci of which 105 were shown to have a statistically significant non-random distribution in phase status. The 82 GIs, but not the LOF loci, were associated with genetic lineage and invasiveness using the disease carriage ratio metric. These observations have been integrated into a new model that infers the early events of the evolution of the human adapted meningococcus. These pathways are enriched for GIs that are involved in modulating attachment to the host, growth rate, iron uptake and toxin expression which are proposed to increase competition within the meningococcal population for the limited environmental niche of the human nasopharynx. We surmise that competition for the host mucosal surface with the nasopharyngeal microbiome has led to the selection of isolates with traits that enable access to cell types (non-phagocytic and phagocytic) in the submucosal tissues leading to an increased risk for IMD.","157":"Bacterial genomes often reflect a bias in the usage of codons. These biases are often most notable within highly expressed genes. While deviations in codon usage can be attributed to selection or mutational biases, they can also be functional, for example controlling gene expression or guiding protein structure. Several different metrics have been developed to identify biases in codon usage. Previously we released a database, CBDB: The Codon Bias Database, in which users could retrieve precalculated codon bias data for bacterial RefSeq genomes. With the increase of bacterial genome sequence data since its release a new tool was needed. Here we present the Dynamic Codon Biaser (DCB) tool, a web application that dynamically calculates the codon usage bias statistics of prokaryotic genomes. DCB bases these calculations on 40 different highly expressed genes (HEGs) that are highly conserved across different prokaryotic species. A user can either specify an NCBI accession number or upload their own sequence. DCB returns both the bias statistics and the genome's HEG sequences. These calculations have several downstream applications, such as evolutionary studies and phage-host predictions.

The upper respiratory tract microbiota has been suggested to explain differential susceptibility to ARIs and modulate ARI severity. The aim of the present study was to investigate the relation of nasopharyngeal microbiota and other microbiological parameters with respiratory health and disease, and to assess nasopharyngeal microbiota diagnostic utility for discriminating between different respiratory health statuses. We conducted a prospective case-control study at Hospital Sant Joan de Deu (Barcelona, Spain) from 2014 to 2018. This study included three groups of children &lt;18 years with gradual decrease of ARI severity: cases with invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) (representative of lower respiratory tract infections and systemic infections), symptomatic controls with mild viral upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), and healthy\/asymptomatic controls according to an approximate case-control ratio 1:2. Nasopharyngeal samples were collected from participants for detection, quantification and serotyping of pneumococcal DNA, viral DNA\/RNA detection and 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Microbiological parameters were included on case-control classification models. A total of 140 subjects were recruited (IPD=27, URTI=48, healthy\/asymptomatic control=65). Children's nasopharyngeal microbiota composition varied according to respiratory health status and infection severity. The IPD group was characterized by overrepresentation of Streptococcus pneumoniae, higher frequency of invasive pneumococcal serotypes, increased rate of viral infection and underrepresentation of potential protective bacterial species such as Dolosigranulum pigrum and Moraxella lincolnii. Microbiota-based classification models differentiated cases from controls with moderately high accuracy. These results demonstrate the close relationship existing between a child's nasopharyngeal microbiota and respiratory health, and provide initial evidence of the potential of microbiota-based diagnostics for differential diagnosis of severe ARIs using non-invasive samples.","159":"","160":null,"161":"The intriguing recent discovery of Campylobacter coli strains, especially of clade 1, that (i) possess mosaic C. coli\/C. jejuni alleles, (ii) demonstrate mixed multilocus sequence types (MLSTs) and (iii) have undergone genome-wide introgression has led to the speculation that these two species may be involved in an accelerated rate of horizontal gene transfer that is progressively leading to the merging of both species in a process coined 'despeciation'. In an MLST-based neighbour-joining tree of a number of C. coli and C. jejuni isolates of different clades, three prominent Campylobacter isolates formed a seemingly separate cluster besides the previously described C. coli and C. jejuni clades. In the light of the suspected, ongoing genetic introgression between the C. coli and C. jejuni species, this cluster of Campylobacter isolates is proposed to present one of the hybrid clonal complexes in the despeciation process of the genus. Specific DNA methylation as well as restriction modification systems are known to be involved in selective uptake of external DNA and their role in such genetic introgression remains to be further investigated. In this study, the phylogeny and DNA methylation of these putative C. coli\/C. jejuni hybrid strains were explored, their genomic mosaic structure caused by C. jejuni introgression was demonstrated and basic phenotypic assays were used to characterize these isolates. The genomes of the three hybrid Campylobacter strains were sequenced using PacBio SMRT sequencing, followed by methylome analysis by Restriction-Modification Finder and genome analysis by Parsnp, Smash++ and blast. Additionally, the strains were phenotypically characterized with respect to growth behaviour, motility, eukaryotic cell invasion and adhesion, autoagglutination, biofilm formation, and water survival ability. Our analyses show that the three hybrid Campylobacter strains are clade 1 C. coli strains, which have acquired between 8.1 and 9.1 % of their genome from C. jejuni. The C. jejuni genomic segments acquired are distributed over the entire genome and do not form a coherent cluster. Most of the genes originating from C. jejuni are involved in chemotaxis and motility, membrane transport, cell signalling, or the resistance to toxic compounds such as bile acids. Interspecies gene transfer from C. jejuni has contributed 8.1-9.1% to the genome of three C. coli isolates and initiated the despeciation between C. jejuni and C. coli. Based on their functional annotation, the genes originating from C. jejuni enable the adaptation of the three strains to an intra-intestinal habitat. The transfer of a fused type II restriction-modification system that recognizes the CAYNNNNNCTC\/GAGNNNNNRTG motif seems to be the key for the recombination of the C. jejuni genetic material with C. coli genomes.","162":"","163":null,"164":"","165":null,"166":"","167":null,"168":"","169":"As transposon sequencing (TnSeq) assays have become prolific in the microbiology field, it is of interest to scrutinize their potential drawbacks. TnSeq data consist of millions of nucleotide sequence reads that are generated by PCR amplification of transposon-genomic junctions. Reads mapping to the junctions are enumerated thus providing information on the number of transposon insertion mutations in each individual gene. Here we explore the possibility that PCR amplification of transposon insertions in a TnSeq library skews the results by introducing bias into the detection and\/or enumeration of insertions. We compared the detection and frequency of mapped insertions when altering the number of PCR cycles, and when including a nested PCR, in the enrichment step. Additionally, we present nCATRAs - a novel, amplification-free TnSeq method where the insertions are enriched via CRISPR\/Cas9-targeted transposon cleavage and subsequent Oxford Nanopore MinION sequencing. nCATRAs achieved 54 and 23% enrichment of the transposons and transposon-genomic junctions, respectively, over background genomic DNA. These PCR-based and PCR-free experiments demonstrate that, overall, PCR amplification does not significantly bias the results of TnSeq insofar as insertions in the majority of genes represented in our library were similarly detected regardless of PCR cycle number and whether or not PCR amplification was employed. However, the detection of a small subset of genes which had been previously described as essential is sensitive to the number of PCR cycles. We conclude that PCR-based enrichment of transposon insertions in a TnSeq assay is reliable, but researchers interested in profiling putative essential genes should carefully weigh the number of amplification cycles employed in their library preparation protocols. In addition, nCATRAs is comparable to traditional PCR-based methods (Kendall's correlation=0.896-0.897) although the latter remain superior owing to their accessibility and high sequencing depth.","170":null,"171":"","172":null,"173":"Analysing the flanking sequences surrounding genes of interest is often highly relevant to understanding the role of mobile genetic elements (MGEs) in horizontal gene transfer, particular for antimicrobial-resistance genes. Here, we present Flanker, a Python package that performs alignment-free clustering of gene flanking sequences in a consistent format, allowing investigation of MGEs without prior knowledge of their structure. These clusters, known as 'flank patterns' (FPs), are based on Mash distances, allowing for easy comparison of similarity across sequences. Additionally, Flanker can be flexibly parameterized to fine-tune outputs by characterizing upstream and downstream regions separately, and investigating variable lengths of flanking sequence. We apply Flanker to two recent datasets describing plasmid-associated carriage of important carbapenemase genes (bla OXA-48 and bla KPC-2\/3) and show that it successfully identifies distinct clusters of FPs, including both known and previously uncharacterized structural variants. For example, Flanker identified four Tn4401 profiles that could not be sufficiently characterized using TETyper or MobileElementFinder, demonstrating the utility of Flanker for flanking-gene characterization. Similarly, using a large (n=226) European isolate dataset, we confirm findings from a previous smaller study demonstrating association between Tn1999.2 and bla OXA-48 upregulation and demonstrate 17 FPs (compared to the 5 previously identified). More generally, the demonstration in this study that FPs are associated with geographical regions and antibiotic-susceptibility phenotypes suggests that they may be useful as epidemiological markers.

Pan-genome analyses have been very useful in helping to understand different evolutionary dynamics of bacterial species: an open pan-genome often indicates a free-living lifestyle with metabolic versatility, while closed pan-genomes are linked to host-restricted, ecologically specialized bacteria. A detailed understanding of the species pan-genome has also been instrumental in tracking the phylodynamics of emerging drug resistance mechanisms and drug-resistant pathogens. However, current approaches to analyse a species' pan-genome do not take the species population structure into account, nor do they account for the uneven sampling of different lineages, as is commonplace due to over-sampling of clinically relevant representatives. Here we present the application of a population structure-aware approach for classifying genes in a pan-genome based on within-species distribution. We demonstrate our approach on a collection of 7500 Escherichia coli genomes, one of the most-studied bacterial species and used as a model for an open pan-genome. We reveal clearly distinct groups of genes, clustered by different underlying evolutionary dynamics, and provide a more biologically informed and accurate description of the species' pan-genome.","175":"Treatment failure of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) infections remains problematic in clinical practice because therapeutic options are limited. Penicillin plus potassium clavulanate combination (PENC) was shown to have potential for treating some MRSA infections. We investigated the susceptibility of MRSA isolates and constructed a drug susceptibility prediction model for the phenotype of the PENC. We determined the minimum inhibitory concentration of PENC for MRSA (n=284) in a teaching hospital (SRRSH-MRSA). PENC susceptibility genotypes were analysed using a published genotyping scheme based on the mecA sequence. mecA expression in MRSA isolates was analysed by qPCR. We established a random forest model for predicting PENC-susceptible phenotypes using core genome allelic profiles from cgMLST analysis. We identified S2-R isolates with susceptible mecA genotypes but PENC-resistant phenotypes; these isolates expressed mecA at higher levels than did S2 MRSA (2.61 vs 0.98, P&lt;0.05), indicating the limitation of using a single factor for predicting drug susceptibility. Using the data of selected UK-sourced MRSA (n=74) and MRSA collected in a previous national survey (NA-MRSA, n=471) as a training set, we built a model with accuracies of 0.94 and 0.93 for SRRSH-MRSA and UK-sourced MRSA (n=287, NAM-MRSA) validation sets. The AUROC of this model for SRRSH-MRSA and NAM-MRSA was 0.96 and 0.97. Although the source of the training set data affects the scope of application of the prediction model, our data demonstrated the power of the machine learning approach in predicting susceptibility from cgMLST results.","176":"Hierarchical genotyping approaches can provide insights into the source, geography and temporal distribution of bacterial pathogens. Multiple hierarchical SNP genotyping schemes have previously been developed so that new isolates can rapidly be placed within pre-computed population structures, without the need to rebuild phylogenetic trees for the entire dataset. This classification approach has, however, seen limited uptake in routine public health settings due to analytical complexity and the lack of standardized tools that provide clear and easy ways to interpret results. The BioHansel tool was developed to provide an organism-agnostic tool for hierarchical SNP-based genotyping. The tool identifies split k-mers that distinguish predefined lineages in whole genome sequencing (WGS) data using SNP-based genotyping schemes. BioHansel uses the Aho-Corasick algorithm to type isolates from assembled genomes or raw read sequence data in a matter of seconds, with limited computational resources. This makes BioHansel ideal for use by public health agencies that rely on WGS methods for surveillance of bacterial pathogens. Genotyping results are evaluated using a quality assurance module which identifies problematic samples, such as low-quality or contaminated datasets. Using existing hierarchical SNP schemes for Mycobacterium tuberculosis and Salmonella Typhi, we compare the genotyping results obtained with the k-mer-based tools BioHansel and SKA, with those of the organism-specific tools TBProfiler and genotyphi, which use gold-standard reference-mapping approaches. We show that the genotyping results are fully concordant across these different methods, and that the k-mer-based tools are significantly faster. We also test the ability of the BioHansel quality assurance module to detect intra-lineage contamination and demonstrate that it is effective, even in populations with low genetic diversity. We demonstrate the scalability of the tool using a dataset of ~8100 S. Typhi public genomes and provide the aggregated results of geographical distributions as part of the tool's output. BioHansel is an open source Python 3 application available on PyPI and Conda repositories and as a Galaxy tool from the public Galaxy Toolshed. In a public health context, BioHansel enables rapid and high-resolution classification of bacterial pathogens with low genetic diversity.","177":null,"178":"The Salmonella enterica serotype Paratyphi B complex causes a wide range of diseases, from gastroenteritis to paratyphoid fever, depending on the biotypes Java and sensu stricto.

Here, we conducted the first whole-genome sequencing (WGS) study on 79 Salmonella isolates serotyped as Paratyphi B that were collected from 10 nationwide enteric disease surveillance sites in Bangladesh. Placing these in a global genetic context revealed that these are biotype Java, and the addition of these genomes expanded the previously described PG4 clade containing Bangladeshi and UK isolates. Importantly, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) genes were scarce amongst Bangladeshi S. Java isolates, somewhat surprisingly given the widespread availability of antibiotics without prescription.

To improve our knowledge of the chitinase molecular evolution of Ascomycota, the gene family of 72 representatives of this phylum was identified and subjected to phylogenetic, evolution trajectory and selective pressure analyses. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the chitinase gene family size and enzyme types varied significantly, along with species evolution, especially for groups B and C. In addition, two new subgroups, C3 and C4, are recognized in group C chitinases. Random birth and death testing indicated that gene expansion and contraction occurred in most of the taxa, particularly for species in the order Hypocreales (class Sordariomycetes). From an enzyme function point of view, we speculate that group A chitinases are mainly involved in species growth and development, while the expansion of genes in group B chitinases is related to fungal mycoparasitic and entomopathogenic abilities, and, to a certain extent, the expansion of genes in group C chitinases seems to be correlated with the host range broadening of some plant-pathogenic fungi in Sordariomycetes. Further selection pressure testing revealed that chitinases and the related amino acid sites were under positive selection in the evolutionary history, especially at the nodes sharing common ancestors and the terminal branches of Hypocreales. These results give a reasonable explanation for the size and function differences of chitinase genes among ascomycetes, and provide a scientific basis for understanding the evolutionary trajectories of chitinases, particularly that towards a mycoparasitic lifestyle.","181":"The pangenome contains all genes encoded by a species, with the core genome present in all strains and the accessory genome in only a subset. Coincident gene relationships are expected within the accessory genome, where the presence or absence of one gene is influenced by the presence or absence of another.

We present a complex network of genes that are either found together or that avoid one another more often than would be expected by chance, and show that these relationships vary by lineage. We demonstrate that genes co-occur by function, and that several highly connected gene relationships are linked to mobile genetic elements. We find that genes are more likely to co-occur with, rather than avoid, another gene in the accessory genome. This work furthers our understanding of the dynamic nature of prokaryote pangenomes and implicates both function and mobility as drivers of gene relationships.","182":null,"183":"Leishmania infantum is the main causative agent responsible for visceral leishmaniasis (VL), a disease with global distribution.

The objective of this study was to explore the genomic architecture and diversity of four Colombian L. infantum isolates obtained in this study and to compare these results with the genetic analysis of 183 L. infantum isolates from across the world (obtained from public databases), as well as to analyse the whole rK39 and rK28 antigen sequences in our dataset. The results showed that, at the global level, L. infantum has high genetic homogeneity and extensive aneuploidy. Furthermore, we demonstrated that there are distinct populations of L. infantum circulating in various countries throughout the globe and that populations of distant countries have close genomic relationships. Additionally, this study demonstrated the high genetic variability of the rK28 antigen worldwide. In conclusion, our study allowed us to (i) expand our knowledge of the genomic structure of global L. infantum; (ii) describe the intra-specific genomic variability of this species; and (iii) understand the genomic characteristics of the main antigens used in the diagnosis of VL.

In this study we apply gradient-boosted tree classifiers and a novel computational decontamination technique built upon SHapley Additive exPlanations (SHAP) to identify microbial hallmarks which discriminate blood metagenomic samples of septic patients from that of healthy individuals. Classifiers had high performance when using the read assignments to microbial genera [area under the receiver operating characteristic (AUROC=0.995)], including after removal of species 'culture-confirmed' as the cause of sepsis through clinical testing (AUROC=0.915). Models trained on single genera were inferior to those employing a polymicrobial model and we identified multiple co-occurring bacterial genera absent from healthy controls. While prevailing diagnostic paradigms seek to identify single pathogens, our results point to the involvement of a polymicrobial community in sepsis. We demonstrate the importance of the microbial component in characterising sepsis, which may offer new biological insights into the aetiology of sepsis, and ultimately support the development of clinical diagnostic or even prognostic tools.","188":null,"189":null,"190":null,"191":"Plant diseases caused by fungal pathogens are typically initiated by molecular interactions between 'effector' molecules released by a pathogen and receptor molecules on or within the plant host cell.

However, the bulk of these studies are from Western countries, where microbiota variations are mainly driven by relatively recent migration events. Malaysia is a multicultural society, but differences in gut microbiota persist across ethnicities. We hypothesized that migrant ethnic groups continue to share fundamental gut traits with the population in the country of origin due to shared cultural practices despite subsequent geographical separation. To test this hypothesis, the 16S rRNA gene amplicons from 16 studies comprising three major ethnic groups in Malaysia were analysed, covering 636 Chinese, 248 Indian and 123 Malay individuals from four countries (China, India, Indonesia and Malaysia). A confounder-adjusted permutational multivariate analysis of variance (PERMANOVA) detected a significant association between ethnicity and the gut microbiota (PERMANOVA R 2=0.005, pseudo-F=2.643, P=0.001). A sparse partial least squares - discriminant analysis model trained using the gut microbiota of individuals from China, India and Indonesia (representation of Chinese, Indian and Malay ethnic group, respectively) showed a better-than-random performance in classifying Malaysian of Chinese descent, although the performance for Indian and Malay were modest (true prediction rate, Chinese=0.60, Indian=0.49, Malay=0.44). Separately, differential abundance analysis singled out Ligilactobacillus as being elevated in Indians. We postulate that despite the strong influence of geographical factors on the gut microbiota, cultural similarity due to a shared ethnic origin drives the presence of a shared gut microbiota composition. The interplay of these factors will likely depend on the circumstances of particular groups of migrants.","193":null,"194":null,"195":"Many foundation species in chemosynthesis-based ecosystems rely on environmentally acquired symbiotic bacteria for their survival. Hence, understanding the biogeographic distributions of these symbionts at regional scales is key to understanding patterns of connectivity and predicting resilience of their host populations (and thus whole communities). However, such assessments are challenging because they necessitate measuring bacterial genetic diversity at fine resolutions. For this purpose, the recently discovered clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR) constitutes a promising new genetic marker. These DNA sequences harboured by about half of bacteria hold their viral immune memory, and as such, might allow discrimination of different lineages or strains of otherwise indistinguishable bacteria. In this study, we assessed the potential of CRISPR as a hypervariable phylogenetic marker in the context of a population genetic study of an uncultured bacterial species. We used high-throughput CRISPR-based typing along with multi-locus sequence analysis (MLSA) to characterize the regional population structure of the obligate but environmentally acquired symbiont species Candidatus Endoriftia persephone on the Juan de Fuca Ridge. Mixed symbiont populations of Ca. Endoriftia persephone were sampled across individual Ridgeia piscesae hosts from contrasting habitats in order to determine if environmental conditions rather than barriers to connectivity are more important drivers of symbiont diversity. We showed that CRISPR revealed a much higher symbiont genetic diversity than the other housekeeping genes. Several lines of evidence imply this diversity is indicative of environmental strains. Finally, we found with both CRISPR and gene markers that local symbiont populations are strongly differentiated across sites known to be isolated by deep-sea circulation patterns. This research showed the high power of CRISPR to resolve the genetic structure of uncultured bacterial populations and represents a step towards making keystone microbial species an integral part of conservation policies for upcoming mining operations on the seafloor.","196":null,"197":null,"198":"The evolution and emergence of drug-resistant tuberculosis (TB) has been studied extensively in some contexts, but the ecological drivers of these two processes remain poorly understood. This study sought to describe the joint evolutionary and epidemiological histories of a novel multidrug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis strain recently identified in the capital city of the Republic of Moldova (MDR Ural\/4.2), where genomic surveillance of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis has been limited thus far. Using whole genome sequence data and Bayesian phylogenomic methods, we reconstruct the stepwise acquisition of drug resistance mutations in the MDR Ural\/4.2 strain, estimate its historical bacterial population size over time, and infer the migration history of this strain between Eastern European countries. We infer that MDR Ural\/4.2 likely evolved (via acquisition of rpoB S450L, which confers resistance to rifampin) in the early 1990s, during a period of social turmoil following Moldovan independence from the Soviet Union. This strain subsequently underwent substantial population size expansion in the early 2000s, at a time when national guidelines encouraged inpatient treatment of TB patients. We infer exportation of this strain and its isoniazid-resistant ancestral precursor from Moldova to neighbouring countries starting as early as 1985. Our findings suggest temporal and ecological associations between specific public health practices, including inpatient hospitalization of drug-resistant TB cases from the early 2000s until 2013, and the evolution of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis in Moldova.

IncFII AMR regions were mosaic and likely reorganised by IS26; three of the four plasmids contained azithromycin-resistance genes erm(B) and mph(A) and one harboured the pKSR100 integron. Additionally, all S. sonnei isolates possessed a large IncB\/O\/K\/Z plasmid, two of which carried aph(3')-Ib\/aph(6)-Id\/sul2 and tet(A).

To avoid deleterious effects of TE activity, some fungi have evolved highly sophisticated genomic defences to reduce TE proliferation across the genome. Repeat-induced point mutation (RIP) is a fungal-specific TE defence mechanism efficiently targeting duplicated sequences. The rapid accumulation of RIPs is expected to deactivate TEs over the course of a few generations. The evolutionary dynamics of TEs at the population level in a species with highly repressive genome defences is poorly understood. Here, we analyse 366 whole-genome sequences of Parastagonospora nodorum, a fungal pathogen of wheat with efficient RIP. A global population genomics analysis revealed high levels of genetic diversity and signs of frequent sexual recombination. Contrary to expectations for a species with RIP, we identified recent TE activity in multiple populations. The TE composition and copy numbers showed little divergence among global populations regardless of the demographic history. Miniature inverted-repeat transposable elements (MITEs) and terminal repeat retrotransposons in miniature (TRIMs) were largely underlying recent intra-species TE expansions. We inferred RIP footprints in individual TE families and found that recently active, high-copy TEs have possibly evaded genomic defences. We find no evidence that recent positive selection acted on TE-mediated mutations rather that purifying selection maintained new TE insertions at low insertion frequencies in populations. Our findings highlight the complex evolutionary equilibria established by the joint action of TE activity, selection and genomic repression.","202":"","203":"","204":"Trypanosoma brucei evansi and T. brucei equiperdum are animal infective trypanosomes conventionally classified by their clinical disease presentation, mode of transmission, host range, kinetoplast DNA (kDNA) composition and geographical distribution.

Their classification as independent species or subspecies has been long debated and genomic studies have found that isolates within T. brucei evansi and T. brucei equiperdum have polyphyletic origins. Since current taxonomy does not fully acknowledge these polyphyletic relationships, we re-analysed publicly available genomic data to carefully define each clade of monomorphic trypanosome. This allowed us to identify, and account for, lineage-specific variation. We included a recently published isolate, IVM-t1, which was originally isolated from the genital mucosa of a horse with dourine and typed as T. equiperdum. Our analyses corroborate previous studies in identifying at least four distinct monomorphic T. brucei clades. We also found clear lineage-specific variation in the selection efficacy and heterozygosity of the monomorphic lineages, supporting their distinct evolutionary histories. The inferred evolutionary position of IVM-t1 suggests its reassignment to the T. brucei evansi type B clade, challenging the relationship between the Trypanozoon species, the infected host, mode of transmission and the associated pathological phenotype. The analysis of IVM-t1 also provides, to our knowledge, the first evidence of the expansion of T. brucei evansi type B, or a fifth monomorphic lineage represented by IVM-t1, outside of Africa, with important possible implications for disease diagnosis.","205":null,"206":null,"207":"Whole-genome sequencing is becoming the de facto standard for bacterial outbreak surveillance and infection prevention. This is accompanied by a variety of bioinformatic tools and needs bioinformatics expertise for implementation. However, little is known about the concordance of reported outbreaks when using different bioinformatic workflows. In this multi-centre proficiency testing among 13 major Dutch healthcare-affiliated centres, bacterial whole-genome outbreak analysis was assessed. Centres who participated obtained two randomized bacterial datasets of Illumina sequences, a Klebsiella pneumoniae and a Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium, and were asked to apply their bioinformatic workflows. Centres reported back on antimicrobial resistance, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), and outbreak clusters. The reported clusters were analysed using a method to compare landscapes of phylogenetic trees and calculating Kendall-Colijn distances. Furthermore, fasta files were analysed by state-of-the-art single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis to mitigate the differences introduced by each centre and determine standardized SNP cut-offs. Thirteen centres participated in this study. The reported outbreak clusters revealed discrepancies between centres, even when almost identical bioinformatic workflows were used. Due to stringent filtering, some centres failed to detect extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genes and MLST loci. Applying a standardized method to determine outbreak clusters on the reported de novo assemblies, did not result in uniformity of outbreak-cluster composition among centres.","208":null,"209":"Minimizing false positives is a critical issue when variant calling as no method is without error. It is common practice to post-process a variant-call file (VCF) using hard filter criteria intended to discriminate true-positive (TP) from false-positive (FP) calls. These are applied on the simple principle that certain characteristics are disproportionately represented among the set of FP calls and that a user-chosen threshold can maximize the number detected. To provide guidance on this issue, this study empirically characterized all false SNP and indel calls made using real Illumina sequencing data from six disparate species and 166 variant-calling pipelines (the combination of 14 read aligners with up to 13 different variant callers, plus four 'all-in-one' pipelines). We did not seek to optimize filter thresholds but instead to draw attention to those filters of greatest efficacy and the pipelines to which they may most usefully be applied. In this respect, this study acts as a coda to our previous benchmarking evaluation of bacterial variant callers, and provides general recommendations for effective practice. The results suggest that, of the pipelines analysed in this study, the most straightforward way of minimizing false positives would simply be to use Snippy. We also find that a disproportionate number of false calls, irrespective of the variant-calling pipeline, are located in the vicinity of indels, and highlight this as an issue for future development.","210":"","211":null,"212":"Hadal trenches are the deepest but underexplored ecosystems on the Earth. Inhabiting the trench bottom is a group of micro-organisms termed obligate piezophiles that grow exclusively under high hydrostatic pressures (HHP). To reveal the genetic and physiological characteristics of their peculiar lifestyles and microbial adaptation to extreme high pressures, we sequenced the complete genome of the obligately piezophilic bacterium Moritella yayanosii DB21MT-5 isolated from the deepest oceanic sediment at the Challenger Deep, Mariana Trench. Through comparative analysis against pressure sensitive and deep-sea piezophilic Moritella strains, we identified over a hundred genes that present exclusively in hadal strain DB21MT-5. The hadal strain encodes fewer signal transduction proteins and secreted polysaccharases, but has more abundant metal ion transporters and the potential to utilize plant-derived saccharides. Instead of producing osmolyte betaine from choline as other Moritella strains, strain DB21MT-5 ferments on choline within a dedicated bacterial microcompartment organelle. Furthermore, the defence systems possessed by DB21MT-5 are distinct from other Moritella strains but resemble those in obligate piezophiles obtained from the same geographical setting. Collectively, the intensive comparative genomic analysis of an obligately piezophilic strain Moritella yayanosii DB21MT-5 demonstrates a depth-dependent distribution of energy metabolic pathways, compartmentalization of important metabolism and use of distinct defence systems, which likely contribute to microbial adaptation to the bottom of hadal trench.","213":"","214":"Identification of prokaryotic transposases (Tnps) not only gives insight into the spread of antibiotic resistance and virulence but the process of DNA movement. This study aimed to develop a classifier for predicting Tnps in bacteria and archaea using machine learning (ML) approaches. We extracted a total of 2751 protein features from the training dataset including 14852 Tnps and 14852 controls, and selected 75 features as predictive signatures using the combined mutual information and least absolute shrinkage and selection operator algorithms. By aggregating these signatures, an ensemble classifier that integrated a collection of individual ML-based classifiers, was developed to identify Tnps. Further validation revealed that this classifier achieved good performance with an average AUC of 0.955, and met or exceeded other common methods. Based on this ensemble classifier, a stand-alone command-line tool designated TnpDiscovery was established to maximize the convenience for bioinformaticians and experimental researchers toward Tnp prediction. This study demonstrates the effectiveness of ML approaches in identifying Tnps, facilitating the discovery of novel Tnps in the future.","215":"Achromobacter species are increasingly being detected in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, where they can establish chronic infections by adapting to the lower airway environment. To better understand the mechanisms contributing to a successful colonization by Achromobacter species, we sequenced the whole genome of 54 isolates from 26 patients with occasional and early\/late chronic lung infection. We performed a phylogenetic analysis and compared virulence and resistance genes, genetic variants and mutations, and hypermutability mechanisms between chronic and occasional isolates. We identified five Achromobacter species as well as two non-affiliated genogroups (NGs). Among them were the frequently isolated Achromobacter xylosoxidans and four other species whose clinical importance is not yet clear: Achromobacter insuavis, Achromobacter dolens, Achromobacter insolitus and Achromobacter aegrifaciens. While A. insuavis and A. dolens were isolated only from chronically infected patients and A. aegrifaciens only from occasionally infected patients, the other species were found in both groups. Most of the occasional isolates lacked functional genes involved in invasiveness, chemotaxis, type 3 secretion system and anaerobic growth, whereas the great majority (&gt;60%) of chronic isolates had these genomic features. Interestingly, almost all (n=22\/23) late chronic isolates lacked functional genes involved in lipopolysaccharide production. Regarding antibiotic resistance, we observed a species-specific distribution of blaOXA genes, confirming what has been reported in the literature and additionally identifying blaOXA-2 in some A. insolitus isolates and observing no blaOXA genes in A. aegrifaciens or NGs. No significant difference in resistance genes was found between chronic and occasional isolates. The results of the mutator genes analysis showed that no occasional isolate had hypermutator characteristics, while 60% of early chronic (&lt;1 year from first colonization) and 78% of late chronic (&gt;1 year from first colonization) isolates were classified as hypermutators. Although all A. dolens, A. insuavis and NG isolates presented two different mutS genes, these seem to have a complementary rather than compensatory function. In conclusion, our results show that Achromobacter species can exhibit different adaptive mechanisms and some of these mechanisms might be more useful than others in establishing a chronic infection in CF patients, highlighting their importance for the clinical setting and the need for further studies on the less clinically characterized Achromobacter species.","216":null,"217":null,"218":"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming the de facto standard for bacterial typing and outbreak surveillance of resistant bacterial pathogens. However, interoperability for WGS of bacterial outbreaks is poorly understood. We hypothesized that harmonization of WGS for outbreak surveillance is achievable through the use of identical protocols for both data generation and data analysis. A set of 30 bacterial isolates, comprising of various species belonging to the Enterobacteriaceae family and Enterococcus genera, were selected and sequenced using the same protocol on the Illumina MiSeq platform in each individual centre. All generated sequencing data were analysed by one centre using BioNumerics (6.7.3) for (i) genotyping origin of replications and antimicrobial resistance genes, (ii) core-genome multi-locus sequence typing (cgMLST) for Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae and whole-genome multi-locus sequencing typing (wgMLST) for all species. Additionally, a split k-mer analysis was performed to determine the number of SNPs between samples. A precision of 99.0% and an accuracy of 99.2% was achieved for genotyping. Based on cgMLST, a discrepant allele was called only in 2\/27 and 3\/15 comparisons between two genomes, for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Based on wgMLST, the number of discrepant alleles ranged from 0 to 7 (average 1.6). For SNPs, this ranged from 0 to 11 SNPs (average 3.4). Furthermore, we demonstrate that using different de novo assemblers to analyse the same dataset introduces up to 150 SNPs, which surpasses most thresholds for bacterial outbreaks. This shows the importance of harmonization of data-processing surveillance of bacterial outbreaks. In summary, multi-centre WGS for bacterial surveillance is achievable, but only if protocols are harmonized.","219":null,"220":"Antibiotic resistance is regarded as one of the most serious threats to human health worldwide. The rapid increase in resistance rates has been attributed to the extensive use of antibiotics since they became commercially available. The use of antibiotics as growth promotors has been banned in numerous regions for this reason. Mannan-rich fraction (MRF) has been reported to show similar growth-promoting effects to antibiotics. We investigated the effect of MRF on the microbial community, resistome and metabolic pathways within the caecum of commercial broilers at two different timepoints within the growth of the broiler, day 27 and day 34. The data indicated an overall increase in health and economic gain for the producer with the addition of MRF to the diet of the broilers. The only significant difference across the microbial composition of the samples was in the richness of the microbial communities across all samples. While all samples harboured resistance genes conferring resistance to the same classes of antibiotics, there was significant variation in the antimicrobial resistance gene richness across time and treatment and across combinations of time and treatment. The taxa with positive correlation comprised Bacilli and Clostridia. The negative correlation taxa were also dominated by Bacilli, specifically the Streptococcus genera. The KEGG-pathway analysis identified an age-related change in the metabolism pathway abundances of the caecal microflora. We suggest that the MRF-related increases in health and weight gain in the broilers may be associated with changes in the metabolism of the microbiomes rather than the microbial composition. The resistome variations across samples were correlated with specific genera. These data may be used to further enhance the development of feed supplements to reduce the presence of antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs) within poultry. While the ARGs of greatest concern to human or animal health were not detected in this study, it has identified the potential to reduce the presence of ARGs by the increase in specific genera.","221":"","222":"","223":"","224":"Current methods in comparative genomic analyses for metabolic potential prediction of proteins involved in, or associated with the Dsr (dissimilatory sulphite reductase)-dependent dissimilatory sulphur metabolism are both time-intensive and computationally challenging, especially when considering metagenomic data.

It takes user-supplied protein sequences and lists the identified proteins and their classification in terms of protein family and predicted type. It can also extract the sequence data from user-input to serve as basis for additional downstream analyses. DiSCo provides the metabolic functional prediction of proteins involved in Dsr-dependent dissimilatory sulphur metabolism with high levels of accuracy in a fast manner. We ran DiSCo against a dataset composed of over 190 thousand (meta)genomic records and efficiently mapped Dsr-dependent dissimilatory sulphur proteins in 1798 lineages across both prokaryotic domains. This allowed the identification of new micro-organisms belonging to Thaumarchaeota and Spirochaetes lineages with the metabolic potential to use the Dsr-pathway for energy conservation.

There is still debate in the literature as to whether mammary pathogenic E. coli (MPEC) is indeed a unique E. coli pathotype, or whether this infection is merely an opportunistic infection caused by any E. coli isolate being displaced from the bovine gastrointestinal tract to the environment and, then, into the udder. In this study, we conducted a thorough genomic analysis of 113 novel MPEC isolates from clinical mastitis cases and 100 bovine commensal E. coli isolates. A phylogenomic analysis indicated that MPEC and commensal E. coli isolates formed clades based on common sequence types and O antigens, but did not cluster based on mammary pathogenicity. A comparative genomic analysis of MPEC and commensal isolates led to the identification of nine genes that were part of either the core or the soft-core MPEC genome, but were not found in any bovine commensal isolates. These apparent MPEC marker genes were genes involved with nutrient intake and metabolism [adeQ, adenine permease; nifJ, pyruvate-flavodoxin oxidoreductase; and yhjX, putative major facilitator superfamily (MFS)-type transporter], included fitness and virulence factors commonly seen in uropathogenic E. coli (pqqL, zinc metallopeptidase, and fdeC, intimin-like adhesin, respectively), and putative proteins [yfiE, uncharacterized helix-turn-helix-type transcriptional activator; ygjI, putative inner membrane transporter; and ygjJ, putative periplasmic protein]. Further characterization of these highly conserved MPEC genes may be critical to understanding the pathobiology of MPEC.","229":"Pseudomonas is a highly diverse genus that includes species that cause disease in both plants and animals. Recently, pathogenic pseudomonads from the Pseudomonas syringae and Pseudomonas fluorescens species complexes have caused significant outbreaks in several agronomically important crops in Turkey, including tomato, citrus, artichoke and melon. We characterized 169 pathogenic Pseudomonas strains associated with recent outbreaks in Turkey via multilocus sequence analysis and whole-genome sequencing, then used comparative and evolutionary genomics to characterize putative virulence mechanisms. Most of the isolates are closely related to other plant pathogens distributed among the primary phylogroups of P. syringae, although there are significant numbers of P. fluorescens isolates, which is a species better known as a rhizosphere-inhabiting plant-growth promoter. We found that all 39 citrus blast pathogens cluster in P. syringae phylogroup 2, although strains isolated from the same host do not cluster monophyletically, with lemon, mandarin orange and sweet orange isolates all being intermixed throughout the phylogroup. In contrast, 20 tomato pith pathogens are found in two independent lineages: one in the P. syringae secondary phylogroups, and the other from the P. fluorescens species complex. These divergent pith necrosis strains lack characteristic virulence factors like the canonical tripartite type III secretion system, large effector repertoires and the ability to synthesize multiple bacterial phytotoxins, suggesting they have alternative molecular mechanisms to cause disease. These findings highlight the complex nature of host specificity among plant pathogenic pseudomonads.","230":"SAR11 bacteria dominate ocean surface bacterioplankton communities, and play an important role in marine carbon and nutrient cycling. The biology and ecology of SAR11 are impacted by SAR11 phages (pelagiphages) that are highly diverse and abundant in the ocean. Among the currently known pelagiphages, HTVC010P represents an extremely abundant but under-studied phage group in the ocean. In this study, we have isolated seven new HTVC010P-type pelagiphages, and recovered 77 nearly full-length HTVC010P-type metagenomic viral genomes from marine metagenomes. Comparative genomic and phylogenomic analyses showed that HTVC010P-type pelagiphages display genome synteny and can be clustered into two major subgroups, with subgroup I consisting of strictly lytic phages and subgroup II mostly consisting of phages with potential lysogenic life cycles. All but one member of the subgroup II contain an integrase gene. Site-specific integration of subgroup II HTVC010P-type pelagiphage was either verified experimentally or identified by in silico genomic sequence analyses, which revealed that various SAR11 tRNA genes can serve as the integration sites of HTVC010P-type pelagiphages. Moreover, HTVC010P-type pelagiphage integration was confirmed by the detection of several Global Ocean Survey (GOS) fragments that contain hybrid phage-host integration sites. Metagenomic recruitment analysis revealed that these HTVC010P-type phages were globally distributed and most lytic subgroup I members exhibited higher relative abundance. Altogether, this study significantly expands our knowledge about the genetic diversity, life strategies and ecology of HTVC010P-type pelagiphages.","231":"This study investigated the evolution and epidemiology of the community-associated and multidrug-resistant Staphylococcus aureus clone European CC1-MRSA-IV. Whole-genome sequences were obtained for 194 European CC1-MRSA-IV isolates (189 of human and 5 of animal origin) from 12 countries, and 10 meticillin-susceptible precursors (from North-Eastern Romania; all of human origin) of the clone. Phylogenetic analysis was performed using a maximum-likelihood approach, a time-measured phylogeny was reconstructed using Bayesian analysis, and in silico microarray genotyping was performed to identify resistance, virulence-associated and SCCmec (staphylococcal cassette chromosome mec) genes. Isolates were typically sequence type 1 (190\/204) and spa type t127 (183\/204). Bayesian analysis indicated that European CC1-MRSA-IV emerged in approximately 1995 before undergoing rapid expansion in the late 1990s and 2000s, while spreading throughout Europe and into the Middle East. Phylogenetic analysis revealed an unstructured meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) population, lacking significant geographical or temporal clusters. The MRSA were genotypically multidrug-resistant, consistently encoded seh, and intermittently (34\/194) encoded an undisrupted hlb gene with concomitant absence of the lysogenic phage-encoded genes sak and scn. All MRSA also harboured a characteristic ~5350 nt insertion in SCCmec adjacent to orfX. Detailed demographic data from Denmark showed that there, the clone is typically (25\/35) found in the community, and often (10\/35) among individuals with links to South-Eastern Europe. This study elucidated the evolution and epidemiology of European CC1-MRSA-IV, which emerged from a meticillin-susceptible lineage prevalent in North-Eastern Romania before disseminating rapidly throughout Europe.","232":null,"233":null,"234":"Pseudomonas corrugata constitute one of the phylogenomic subgroups within the Pseudomonas fluorescens species complex and include both plant growth-promoting rhizobacteria (PGPR) and plant pathogenic bacteria. Previous studies suggest that the species diversity of this group remains largely unexplored together with frequent misclassification of strains. Using more than 1800 sequenced Pseudomonas genomes we identified 121 genomes belonging to the P. corrugata subgroup. Intergenomic distances obtained using the genome-to-genome blast distance (GBDP) algorithm and the determination of digital DNA-DNA hybridization values were further used for phylogenomic and clustering analyses, which revealed 29 putative species clusters, of which only five correspond to currently named species within the subgroup. Comparative and functional genome-scale analyses also support the species status of these clusters. The search for PGPR and plant pathogenic determinants showed that approximately half of the genomes analysed could have a pathogenic behaviour based on the presence of a pathogenicity genetic island, while all analysed genomes possess PGPR traits. Finally, this information together with the characterization of phenotypic traits, allows the reclassification proposal of Pseudomonas fluorescens F113 as Pseudomonas ogarae sp. nov., nom rev., type strain F113T (=DSM 112162T=CECT 30235T), which is substantiated by genomic, functional genomics and phenotypic differences with their closest type strains.","235":"Located at the tip of cell surface glycoconjugates, sialic acids are at the forefront of host-microbe interactions and, being easily liberated by sialidase enzymes, are used as metabolites by numerous bacteria, particularly by pathogens and commensals living on or near diverse mucosal surfaces. These bacteria rely on specific transporters for the acquisition of host-derived sialic acids. Here, we present the first comprehensive genomic and phylogenetic analysis of bacterial sialic acid transporters, leading to the identification of multiple new families and subfamilies. Our phylogenetic analysis suggests that sialic acid-specific transport has evolved independently at least eight times during the evolution of bacteria, from within four of the major families\/superfamilies of bacterial transporters, and we propose a robust classification scheme to bring together a myriad of different nomenclatures that exist to date. The new transporters discovered occur in diverse bacteria, including Spirochaetes, Bacteroidetes, Planctomycetes and Verrucomicrobia, many of which are species that have not been previously recognized to have sialometabolic capacities. Two subfamilies of transporters stand out in being fused to the sialic acid mutarotase enzyme, NanM, and these transporter fusions are enriched in bacteria present in gut microbial communities. Our analysis supports the increasing experimental evidence that competition for host-derived sialic acid is a key phenotype for successful colonization of complex mucosal microbiomes, such that a strong evolutionary selection has occurred for the emergence of sialic acid specificity within existing transporter architectures.","236":"Species of the floating, freshwater fern Azolla form a well-characterized symbiotic association with the non-culturable cyanobacterium Nostoc azollae, which fixes nitrogen for the plant. However, several cyanobacterial strains have over the years been isolated and cultured from Azolla from all over the world. The genomes of 10 of these strains were sequenced and compared with each other, with other symbiotic cyanobacterial strains, and with similar strains that were not isolated from a symbiotic association. The 10 strains fell into three distinct groups: six strains were nearly identical to the non-symbiotic strain, Nostoc (Anabaena) variabilis ATCC 29413; three were similar to the symbiotic strain, Nostoc punctiforme, and one, Nostoc sp. 2RC, was most similar to non-symbiotic strains of Nostoc linckia. However, Nostoc sp. 2RC was unusual because it has three sets of nitrogenase genes; it has complete gene clusters for two distinct Mo-nitrogenases and an alternative V-nitrogenase. Genes for Mo-nitrogenase, sugar transport, chemotaxis and pili characterized all the symbiotic strains. Several of the strains infected the liverwort Blasia, including N. variabilis ATCC 29413, which did not originate from Azolla but rather from a sewage pond. However, only Nostoc sp. 2RC, which produced highly motile hormogonia, was capable of high-frequency infection of Blasia. Thus, some of these strains, which grow readily in the laboratory, may be useful in establishing novel symbiotic associations with other plants.","237":null,"238":"Herpes simplex virus serotype 2 (HSV-2) is a ubiquitous human pathogen that causes recurrent genital infections and ulcerations. Many HSV-2 strains with different biological properties have been identified, but only the genomes of HSV-2 strains HG52, SD90e and 333 have been reported as complete and fully characterized sequences. We de novo assembled, annotated and manually curated the complete genome sequence of HSV-2 strain MS, a highly neurovirulent strain, originally isolated from a multiple sclerosis patient. We resolved both DNA ends, as well as the complex inverted repeats regions present in HSV genomes, usually undisclosed in previous published partial herpesvirus genomes, using long reads from Pacific Biosciences (PacBio) technology. Additionally, we identified isomeric genomes by determining the alternative relative orientation of unique fragments in the genome of the sequenced viral population. Illumina short-read sequencing was crucial to examine genetic variability, such as nucleotide polymorphisms, insertion\/deletions and sequence determinants of strain-specific virulence factors. We used Illumina data to fix two disrupted open reading frames found in coding homopolymers after PacBio assembly. These results support the combination of long- and short-read sequencing technologies as a precise and effective approach for the accurate de novo assembly and curation of complex microbial genomes.","239":"Prokaryote genome evolution is characterized by the frequent gain of genes through horizontal gene transfer (HGT). For a gene, being horizontally transferred can represent a strong change in its genomic and physiological context. If the codon usage of a transferred gene deviates from that of the receiving organism, the fitness benefits it provides can be reduced due to a mismatch with the expression machinery. Consequently, transferred genes with a deviating codon usage can be selected against or elicit evolutionary responses that enhance their integration, such as gene amelioration and compensatory evolution. Within bacterial species, the extent and relative importance of these different mechanisms has never been considered altogether. In this study, a phylogeny-based method was used to investigate the occurrence of these different evolutionary responses in Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Selection on codon usage of genes acquired through HGT was observed over evolutionary time, with the overall codon usage converging towards that of the core genome. Gene amelioration, through the accumulation of synonymous mutations after HGT, did not seem to systematically affect transferred genes. This pattern therefore seemed to be mainly driven by selective retention of transferred genes with an initial codon usage similar to that of the core genes. Additionally, variation in the copy number of tRNA genes was often associated with the acquisition of genes for which the observed variation could enhance their expression. This provides evidence that compensatory evolution might be an important mechanism for the integration of horizontally transferred genes.","240":"","241":"Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), the novel coronavirus responsible for the COVID-19 pandemic, continues to cause a significant public-health burden and disruption globally. Genomic epidemiology approaches point to most countries in the world having experienced many independent introductions of SARS-CoV-2 during the early stages of the pandemic. However, this situation may change with local lockdown policies and restrictions on travel, leading to the emergence of more geographically structured viral populations and lineages transmitting locally. Here, we report the first SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Palestine sampled from early March 2020, when the first cases were observed, through to August of 2020. SARS-CoV-2 genomes from Palestine fall across the diversity of the global phylogeny, consistent with at least nine independent introductions into the region. We identify one locally predominant lineage in circulation represented by 50 Palestinian SARS-CoV-2, grouping with genomes generated from Israel and the UK. We estimate the age of introduction of this lineage to 05\/02\/2020 (16\/01\/2020-19\/02\/2020), suggesting SARS-CoV-2 was already in circulation in Palestine predating its first detection in Bethlehem in early March.

ETEC persisting in water exhibit a distinct RNA expression profile from those growing in richer media. Multiple pathways were identified that contribute to water survival, including lipopolysaccharide biosynthesis and stress response regulons. The analysis also indicated that ETEC growing in vivo in mice encounter a bottleneck driving down the diversity of colonizing ETEC populations.","246":"The recent re-emergence of multidrug-resistant pathogens has exacerbated their threat to worldwide public health. The evolution of the genomics era has led to the generation of huge volumes of sequencing data at an unprecedented rate due to the ever-reducing costs of whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We have developed the Rapid Microbial Analysis Pipeline (rMAP), a user-friendly pipeline capable of profiling the resistomes of ESKAPE pathogens (Enterococcus faecium, Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa and Enterobacter species) using WGS data generated from Illumina's sequencing platforms. rMAP is designed for individuals with little bioinformatics expertise, and automates the steps required for WGS analysis directly from the raw genomic sequence data, including adapter and low-quality sequence read trimming, de novo genome assembly, genome annotation, single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) variant calling, phylogenetic inference by maximum likelihood, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiling, plasmid profiling, virulence factor determination, multi-locus sequence typing (MLST), pangenome analysis and insertion sequence characterization (IS). Once the analysis is finished, rMAP generates an interactive web-like html report. rMAP installation is very simple, it can be run using very simple commands. It represents a rapid and easy way to perform comprehensive bacterial WGS analysis using a personal laptop in low-income settings where high-performance computing infrastructure is limited.","247":"Although the beneficial effects of probiotics are likely to be associated with their ability to colonize the gut, little is known about the characteristics of good colonizers. In a systematic analysis of the comparative genomics, we tried to elucidate the genomic contents that account for the distinct host adaptability patterns of Lactobacillus and Bifidobacterium species. The Bifidobacterium species, with species-level phylogenetic structures affected by recombination among strains, broad mucin-foraging activity, and dietary-fibre-degrading ability, represented niche conservatism and tended to be host-adapted. The Lactobacillus species stretched across three lifestyles, namely free-living, nomadic and host-adapted, as characterized by the variations of bacterial occurrence time, guanine-cytosine (GC) content and genome size, evolution event frequency, and the presence of human-adapted bacterial genes. The numbers and activity of host-adapted factors, such as bile salt hydrolase and intestinal tissue-anchored elements, were distinctly distributed among the three lifestyles. The strains of the three lifestyles could be separated with such a collection of colonization-related genomic content (genes, genome size and GC content). Thus, our work provided valuable information for rational selection and gut engraftment prediction of probiotics. Here, we have found many interesting predictive results for bacterial gut fitness, which will be validated in vitro and in vivo.","248":"Members of the bacterial genus Vibrio utilize chitin both as a metabolic substrate and a signal to activate natural competence. Vibrio cholerae is a bacterial enteric pathogen, sub-lineages of which can cause pandemic cholera. However, the chitin metabolic pathway in V. cholerae has been dissected using only a limited number of laboratory strains of this species. Here, we survey the complement of key chitin metabolism genes amongst 195 diverse V. cholerae. We show that the gene encoding GbpA, known to be an important colonization and virulence factor in pandemic isolates, is not ubiquitous amongst V. cholerae. We also identify a putatively novel chitinase, and present experimental evidence in support of its functionality. Our data indicate that the chitin metabolic pathway within V. cholerae is more complex than previously thought, and emphasize the importance of considering genes and functions in the context of a species in its entirety, rather than simply relying on traditional reference strains.","249":"The vaginal microbiota, normally characterized by lactobacilli presence, is crucial for vaginal health. Members belonging to L. crispatus and L. gasseri species exert crucial protective functions against pathogens, although a total comprehension of factors that influence their dominance in healthy women is still lacking. Here we investigated the complete genome sequence and comprehensive phenotypic profile of L. crispatus strain BC5 and L. gasseri strain BC12, two vaginal strains featured by anti-bacterial and anti-viral activities. Phenotype microarray (PM) results revealed an improved capacity of BC5 to utilize different carbon sources as compared to BC12, although some specific carbon sources that can be associated to the human diet were only metabolized by BC12, i.e. uridine, amygdalin, tagatose. Additionally, the two strains were mostly distinct in the capacity to utilize the nitrogen sources under analysis. On the other hand, BC12 showed tolerance\/resistance towards twice the number of stressors (i.e. antibiotics, toxic metals etc.) with respect to BC5. The divergent phenotypes observed in PM were supported by the identification in either BC5 or BC12 of specific genetic determinants that were found to be part of the core genome of each species. The PM results in combination with comparative genome data provide insights into the possible environmental factors and genetic traits supporting the predominance of either L. crispatus BC5 or L. gasseri BC12 in the vaginal niche, giving also indications for metabolic predictions at the species level.","250":"Mycobacterium bovis is a causal agent of bovine tuberculosis (bTB), one of the most important diseases currently facing the cattle industry worldwide. Tracing the source of M. bovis infections of livestock is an important tool for understanding the epidemiology of bTB and defining control\/eradication strategies. In this study, whole genome sequencing (WGS) of 74 M. bovis isolates sourced from naturally infected cattle in the State of Rio Grande do Sul (RS), southern Brazil, was used to evaluate the population structure of M. bovis in the region, identify potential transmission events and date the introduction of clonal complex (CC) European 2 (Eu2). In silico spoligotyping identified 11 distinct patterns including four new profiles and two CCs, European 1 (Eu1) and Eu2. The analyses revealed a high level of genetic diversity in the majority of herds and identified putative transmission clusters that suggested that within- and between-herd transmission is occurring in RS. In addition, a comparison with other published M. bovis isolates from Argentina, Brazil, Paraguay and Uruguay demonstrated some evidence for a possible cross-border transmission of CC Eu1 into RS from Uruguay or Argentina. An estimated date for the introduction of CC Eu2 into RS in the middle of the 19th century correlated with the historical introduction of cattle into RS to improve existing local breeds. These findings contribute to the understanding of the population structure of M. bovis in southern Brazil and highlight the potential of WGS in surveillance and helping to identify bTB transmission.","251":"Fatal exudative dermatitis (FED) is a significant cause of death of red squirrels (Sciurus vulgaris) on the island of Jersey in the Channel Islands where it is associated with a virulent clone of Staphylococcus aureus, ST49. S. aureus ST49 has been found in other hosts such as small mammals, pigs and humans, but the dynamics of carriage and disease of this clone, or any other lineage in red squirrels, is currently unknown. We used whole-genome sequencing to characterize 228 isolates from healthy red squirrels on Jersey, the Isle of Arran (Scotland) and Brownsea Island (England), from red squirrels showing signs of FED on Jersey and the Isle of Wight (England) and a small number of isolates from other hosts. S. aureus was frequently carried by red squirrels on the Isle of Arran with strains typically associated with small ruminants predominating. For the Brownsea carriage, S. aureus was less frequent and involved strains associated with birds, small ruminants and humans, while for the Jersey carriage S. aureus was rare but ST49 predominated in diseased squirrels. By combining our data with publicly available sequences, we show that the S. aureus carriage in red squirrels largely reflects frequent but facile acquisitions of strains carried by other hosts sharing their habitat ('spillover'), possibly including, in the case of ST188, humans. Genome-wide association analysis of the ruminant lineage ST133 revealed variants in a small number of mostly bacterial-cell-membrane-associated genes that were statistically associated with squirrel isolates from the Isle of Arran, raising the possibility of specific adaptation to red squirrels in this lineage. In contrast there is little evidence that ST49 is a common carriage isolate of red squirrels and infection from reservoir hosts such as bank voles or rats, is likely to be driving the emergence of FED in red squirrels.","252":null,"253":"","254":"Carbapenem-hydrolysing enzymes belonging to the OXA-48-like group are encoded by bla OXA-48-like alleles and are abundant among Enterobacterales in the Netherlands. Therefore, the objective here was to investigate the characteristics, gene content and diversity of the bla OXA-48-like carrying plasmids and chromosomes of Escherichia coli and Klebsiella pneumoniae collected in the Dutch national surveillance from 2014 to 2019 in comparison with genome sequences from 29 countries. A combination of short-read genome sequencing with long-read sequencing enabled the reconstruction of 47 and 132 complete bla OXA-48-like plasmids for E. coli and K. pneumoniae, respectively. Seven distinct plasmid groups designated as pOXA-48-1 to pOXA-48-5, pOXA-181 and pOXA-232 were identified in the Netherlands which were similar to internationally reported plasmids obtained from countries from North and South America, Europe, Asia and Oceania. The seven plasmid groups varied in size, G+C content, presence of antibiotic resistance genes, replicon family and gene content. The pOXA-48-1 to pOXA-48-5 plasmids were variable, and the pOXA-181 and pOXA-232 plasmids were conserved. The pOXA-48-1, pOXA-48-2, pOXA-48-3 and pOXA-48-5 groups contained a putative conjugation system, but this was absent in the pOXA-48-4, pOXA-181 and pOXA-232 plasmid groups. pOXA-48 plasmids contained the PemI antitoxin, while the pOXA-181 and pOXA-232 plasmids did not. Furthermore, the pOXA-181 plasmids carried a virB2-virB3-virB9-virB10-virB11 type IV secretion system, while the pOXA-48 plasmids and pOXA-232 lacked this system. A group of non-related pOXA-48 plasmids from the Netherlands contained different resistance genes, non-IncL-type replicons or no replicons. Whole genome multilocus sequence typing revealed that the bla OXA-48-like plasmids were found in a wide variety of genetic backgrounds in contrast to chromosomally encoded bla OXA-48-like alleles. Chromosomally localized bla OXA-48 and bla OXA-244 alleles were located on genetic elements of variable sizes and comprised regions of pOXA-48 plasmids. The bla OXA-48-like genetic element was flanked by a direct repeat upstream of IS1R, and was found at multiple locations in the chromosomes of E. coli. Lastly, K. pneumoniae isolates carrying bla OXA-48 or bla OXA-232 were mostly resistant for meropenem, whereas E. coli bla OXA-48, bla OXA-181 and chromosomal bla OXA-48 or bla OXA-244 isolates were mostly sensitive. In conclusion, the overall bla OXA-48-like plasmid population in the Netherlands is conserved and similar to that reported for other countries, confirming global dissemination of bla OXA-48-like plasmids. Variations in size, presence of antibiotic resistance genes and gene content impacted pOXA-48, pOXA-181 and pOXA-232 plasmid architecture.","255":"The pks island codes for the enzymes necessary for synthesis of the genotoxin colibactin, which contributes to the virulence of Escherichia coli strains and is suspected of promoting colorectal cancer. From a collection of 785 human and bovine E. coli isolates, we identified 109 strains carrying a highly conserved pks island, mostly from phylogroup B2, but also from phylogroups A, B1 and D. Different scenarios of pks acquisition were deduced from whole genome sequence and phylogenetic analysis. In the main scenario, pks was introduced and stabilized into certain sequence types (STs) of the B2 phylogroup, such as ST73 and ST95, at the asnW tRNA locus located in the vicinity of the yersiniabactin-encoding High Pathogenicity Island (HPI). In a few B2 strains, pks inserted at the asnU or asnV tRNA loci close to the HPI and occasionally was located next to the remnant of an integrative and conjugative element. In a last scenario specific to B1\/A strains, pks was acquired, independently of the HPI, at a non-tRNA locus. All the pks-positive strains except 18 produced colibactin. Sixteen strains contained mutations in clbB or clbD, or a fusion of clbJ and clbK and were no longer genotoxic but most of them still produced low amounts of potentially active metabolites associated with the pks island. One strain was fully metabolically inactive without pks alteration, but colibactin production was restored by overexpressing the ClbR regulator. In conclusion, the pks island is not restricted to human pathogenic B2 strains and is more widely distributed in the E. coli population, while preserving its functionality.","256":null,"257":null,"258":"Endolithic microbial symbionts in the coral skeleton may play a pivotal role in maintaining coral health. However, compared to aerobic micro-organisms, research on the roles of endolithic anaerobic micro-organisms and microbe-microbe interactions in the coral skeleton are still in their infancy. In our previous study, we showed that a group of coral-associated Prosthecochloris (CAP), a genus of anaerobic green sulphur bacteria, was dominant in the skeleton of the coral Isopora palifera. Though CAP is diverse, the 16S rRNA phylogeny presents it as a distinct clade separate from other free-living Prosthecochloris. In this study, we build on previous research and further characterize the genomic and metabolic traits of CAP by recovering two new high-quality CAP genomes - Candidatus Prosthecochloris isoporae and Candidatus Prosthecochloris sp. N1 - from the coral I. palifera endolithic cultures. Genomic analysis revealed that these two CAP genomes have high genomic similarities compared with other Prosthecochloris and harbour several CAP-unique genes. Interestingly, different CAP species harbour various pigment synthesis and sulphur metabolism genes, indicating that individual CAPs can adapt to a diversity of coral microenvironments. A novel high-quality genome of sulfate-reducing bacterium (SRB)- Candidatus Halodesulfovibrio lyudaonia - was also recovered from the same culture. The fact that CAP and various SRB co-exist in coral endolithic cultures and coral skeleton highlights the importance of SRB in the coral endolithic community. Based on functional genomic analysis of Ca. P. sp. N1, Ca. P. isoporae and Ca. H. lyudaonia, we also propose a syntrophic relationship between the SRB and CAP in the coral skeleton.","259":"An SNP is a spontaneous genetic change having a potential to modify the functions of the original genes and to lead to phenotypic diversity of bacteria in nature. In this study, a phylogenetic analysis of Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis, a major food-borne pathogen, showed that eight strains of S. Enteritidis isolated in South Korea, including FORC_075 and FORC_078, have almost identical genome sequences. Interestingly, however, the abilities of FORC_075 to form biofilms and red, dry and rough (RDAR) colonies were significantly impaired, resulting in phenotypic differences among the eight strains. Comparative genomic analyses revealed that one of the non-synonymous SNPs unique to FORC_075 has occurred in envZ, which encodes a sensor kinase of the EnvZ\/OmpR two-component system. The SNP in envZ leads to an amino acid change from Pro248 (CCG) in other strains including FORC_078 to Leu248 (CTG) in FORC_075. Allelic exchange of envZ between FORC_075 and FORC_078 identified that the SNP in envZ is responsible for the impaired biofilm- and RDAR colony-forming abilities of S. Enteritidis. Biochemical analyses demonstrated that the SNP in envZ significantly increases the phosphorylated status of OmpR in S. Enteritidis and alters the expression of the OmpR regulon. Phenotypic analyses further identified that the SNP in envZ decreases motility of S. Enteritidis but increases its adhesion and invasion to both human epithelial cells and murine macrophage cells. In addition to an enhancement of infectivity to the host cells, survival under acid stress was also elevated by the SNP in envZ. Together, these results suggest that the natural occurrence of the SNP in envZ could contribute to phenotypic diversity of S. Enteritidis, possibly improving its fitness and pathogenesis.","260":null,"261":"Bovine tuberculosis (bTB) is endemic in cattle in Ethiopia, a country that hosts the largest national cattle herd in Africa. The intensive dairy sector, most of which is peri-urban, has the highest prevalence of disease. Previous studies in Ethiopia have demonstrated that the main cause is Mycobacterium bovis, which has been investigated using conventional molecular tools including deletion typing, spoligotyping and Mycobacterial interspersed repetitive unit-variable number tandem repeat (MIRU-VNTR). Here we use whole-genome sequencing to examine the population structure of M. bovis in Ethiopia. A total of 134 M. bovis isolates were sequenced including 128 genomes from 85 mainly dairy cattle and six genomes isolated from humans, originating from 12 study sites across Ethiopia. These genomes provided a good representation of the previously described population structure of M. bovis, based on spoligotyping and demonstrated that the population is dominated by the clonal complexes African 2 (Af2) and European 3 (Eu3). A range of within-host diversity was observed amongst the isolates and evidence was found for both short- and long-distance transmission. Detailed analysis of available genomes from the Eu3 clonal complex combined with previously published genomes revealed two distinct introductions of this clonal complex into Ethiopia between 1950 and 1987, likely from Europe. This work is important to help better understand bTB transmission in cattle in Ethiopia and can potentially inform national strategies for bTB control in Ethiopia and beyond.","262":"","263":"Increasing antimicrobial resistance and limited alternative treatments have led to fluoroquinolone-resistant Shigella strain inclusion on the WHO global priority pathogens list. In this study we characterized multiple Shigella isolates from Malawi with whole genome sequence analysis, identifying the acquirable fluoroquinolone resistance determinant qnrS1.","264":"Metagenomics is a valuable diagnostic tool for enhancing microbial food safety because (i) it enables the untargeted detection of pathogens, (ii) it is fast since primary isolation of micro-organisms is not required, and (iii) it has high discriminatory power allowing for a detailed molecular characterization of pathogens. For shotgun metagenomics, total nucleic acids (NAs) are isolated from complex samples such as foodstuff. Along with microbial NAs, high amounts of matrix NAs are extracted that might outcompete microbial NAs during next-generation sequencing and compromise sensitivity for the detection of low abundance micro-organisms. Sensitive laboratory methods are indispensable for detecting highly pathogenic foodborne bacteria like Brucella spp., because a low infectious dose is sufficient to cause human disease through the consumption of contaminated dairy or meat products. In our study, we applied shotgun metagenomic sequencing for the identification and characterization of Brucella spp. in artificially and naturally contaminated raw milk from various ruminant species. With the depletion of eukaryotic cells prior to DNA extraction, Brucella was detectable at 10 bacterial cells ml-1, while at the same time microbiological culture and isolation of the fastidious bacteria commonly failed. Moreover, we were able to retrieve the genotype of a Brucella isolate from a metagenomic dataset, indicating the potential of metagenomics for outbreak investigations using SNPs and core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). To improve diagnostic applications, we developed a new bioinformatics approach for strain prediction based on SNPs to identify the correct species and define a certain strain with only low numbers of genus-specific reads per sample. This pipeline turned out to be more sensitive and specific than Mash Screen. In raw milk samples, we simultaneously detected numerous other zoonotic pathogens, antimicrobial resistance genes and virulence factors. Our study showed that metagenomics is a highly sensitive tool for biological risk assessment of foodstuffs, particularly when pathogen isolation is hazardous or challenging.","265":null,"266":null,"267":"Lactobacillus helveticus is a well characterized lactobacillus for dairy fermentations that is also found in malt whisky fermentations. The two environments contain considerable differences related to microbial growth, including the presence of different growth inhibitors and nutrients. The present study characterized L. helveticus strains originating from dairy fermentations (called milk strains hereafter) and malt whisky fermentations (called whisky strains hereafter) by in vitro phenotypic tests and comparative genomics. The whisky strains can tolerate ethanol more than the milk strains, whereas the milk strains can tolerate lysozyme and lactoferrin more than the whisky strains. Several plant-origin carbohydrates, including cellobiose, maltose, sucrose, fructooligosaccharide and salicin, were generally metabolized only by the whisky strains, whereas milk-derived carbohydrates, i.e. lactose and galactose, were metabolized only by the milk strains. Milk fermentation properties also distinguished the two groups. The general genomic characteristics, including genomic size, number of coding sequences and average nucleotide identity values, differentiated the two groups. The observed differences in carbohydrate metabolic properties between the two groups correlated with the presence of intact specific enzymes in glycoside hydrolase (GH) families GH1, GH4, GH13, GH32 and GH65. Several GHs in the milk strains were inactive due to the presence of stop codon(s) in genes encoding the GHs, and the inactivation patterns of the genes encoding specific enzymes assigned to GH1 in the milk strains suggested a possible diversification manner of L. helveticus strains. The present study has demonstrated how L. helveticus strains have adapted to their habitats.","268":"The Burkholderia cepacia complex (Bcc) is a closely related group of bacteria, composed of at least 20 different species, the accurate identification of which is essential in the context of infectious diseases. In industry, they can contaminate non-food products, including home and personal care products and cosmetics. The Bcc are problematic contaminants due to their ubiquitous presence and intrinsic antimicrobial resistance, which enables them to occasionally overcome preservation systems in non-sterile products. Burkholderia lata and Burkholderia contaminans are amongst the Bcc bacteria encountered most frequently as industrial contaminants, but their identification is not straightforward. Both species were historically established as a part of a group known collectively as taxon K, based upon analysis of the recA gene and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Here, we deploy a straightforward genomics-based workflow for accurate Bcc classification using average nucleotide identity (ANI) and core-gene analysis. The workflow was used to examine a panel of 23 Burkholderia taxon K industrial strains, which, based on MLST, comprised 13 B. lata, 4 B. contaminans and 6 unclassified Bcc strains. Our genomic identification showed that the B. contaminans strains retained their classification, whilst the remaining strains were reclassified as Burkholderia aenigmatica sp. nov. Incorrect taxonomic identification of industrial contaminants is a problematic issue. Application and testing of our genomic workflow allowed the correct classification of 23 Bcc industrial strains, and also indicated that B. aenigmatica sp. nov. may have greater importance than B. lata as a contaminant species. Our study illustrates how the non-food manufacturing industry can harness whole-genome sequencing to better understand antimicrobial-resistant bacteria affecting their products.","269":null,"270":"Despite the recent advances in sequencing technologies, the complete assembly of multi-chromosome genomes of the Vibrionaceae, often containing several plasmids, remains challenging. Using a combination of Oxford Nanopore MinION long reads and short Illumina reads, we fully sequenced, closed and curated the genomes of two strains of a primary aquatic pathogen Photobacterium damselae subsp. piscicida isolated in Australia. These are also the first genome sequences of P. damselae subsp. piscicida isolated in Oceania and, to our knowledge, in the Southern hemisphere. We also investigated the phylogenetic relationships between Australian and overseas isolates, revealing that Australian P. damselae subsp. piscicida are more closely related to the Asian and American strains rather than to the European ones. We investigated the mobilome and present new evidence showing that a host specialization process and progressive adaptive evolution to fish are ongoing in P. damselae subsp. piscicida, and are largely mediated by transposable elements, predominantly in chromosome 2, and by plasmids. Finally, we identified two novel potential virulence determinants in P. damselae subsp. piscicida - a chorismate mutase gene, which is ubiquitously retained and co-localized with the AIP56 apoptogenic toxin-encoding gene on the pPHDP10 plasmid, and transfer-messenger RNA gene ssrA located on the main chromosome, homologous to a critical-to-virulence determinant in Yersinia pseudotuberculosis. Our study describes, to our knowledge, the only fully closed and manually curated genomes of P. damselae subsp. piscicida available to date, offering new insights into this important fish pathogen and its evolution.","271":null,"272":null,"273":"The warming-induced thawing of permafrost promotes microbial activity, often resulting in enhanced greenhouse gas emissions. The ability of permafrost microorganisms to survive the in situ sub-zero temperatures, their energetic strategies and their metabolic versatility in using soil organic materials determine their growth and functionality upon thawing. Hence, functional characterization of the permafrost microbiome, particularly in the underexplored mid-latitudinal alpine regions, is a crucial first step in predicting its responses to the changing climate, and the consequences for soil-climate feedbacks. In this study, for the first time, the functional potential and metabolic capabilities of a temperate mountain permafrost microbiome from central Europe has been analysed using shotgun metagenomics. Permafrost and active layers from the summit of Muot da Barba Peider (MBP) [Swiss Alps, 2979 m above sea level (a.s.l.)] revealed a strikingly high functional diversity in the permafrost (north-facing soils at a depth of 160 cm). Permafrost metagenomes were enriched in stress-response genes (e.g. cold-shock genes, chaperones), as well as in genes involved in cell defence and competition (e.g. antiviral proteins, antibiotics, motility, nutrient-uptake ABC transporters), compared with active-layer metagenomes. Permafrost also showed a higher potential for the synthesis of carbohydrate-active enzymes, and an overrepresentation of genes involved in fermentation, carbon fixation, denitrification and nitrogen reduction reactions. Collectively, these findings demonstrate the potential capabilities of permafrost microorganisms to thrive in cold and oligotrophic conditions, and highlight their metabolic versatility in carbon and nitrogen cycling. Our study provides a first insight into the high functional gene diversity of the central European mountain permafrost microbiome. Our findings extend our understanding of the microbial ecology of permafrost and represent a baseline for future investigations comparing the functional profiles of permafrost microbial communities at different latitudes.","274":null,"275":null,"276":null,"277":null,"278":"The essential genome of a bacterium encompasses core genes associated with basic cellular processes and conditionally essential genes dependent upon environmental conditions or the genetic context. Comprehensive knowledge of those gene sets allows for a better understanding of fundamental bacterial biology and offers new perspectives for antimicrobial drug research against detrimental bacteria such as pathogens. We investigated the essential genome of Xanthomonas hortorum pv. vitians, a gammaproteobacterial plant pathogen of lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) which belongs to the plant-pathogen reservoir genus Xanthomonas and is affiliated to the family Xanthomonadaceae. No practical means of disease control or prevention against this pathogen is currently available, and its molecular biology is virtually unknown. To reach a comprehensive overview of the essential genome of X. hortorum pv. vitians LM16734, we developed a mixed approach combining high-quality full genome sequencing, saturated transposon insertion sequencing (Tn-Seq) in optimal growth conditions, and coupled computational analyses such as comparative genomics, synteny assessment and phylogenomics. Among the 370 essential loci identified by Tn-Seq, a majority was bound to critical cell processes conserved across bacteria. The remaining genes were either related to specific ecological features of Xanthomonas or Xanthomonadaceae species, or acquired through horizontal gene transfer of mobile genetic elements and associated with ancestral parasitic gene behaviour and bacterial defence systems. Our study sheds new light on our usual concepts about gene essentiality and is pioneering in the molecular and genomic study of X. hortorum pv. vitians.","279":"The increasing use of PCR for the detection of gastrointestinal pathogens in hospital laboratories in England has improved the detection of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC), and the diagnosis of haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS). We aimed to analyse the microbiological characteristics and phylogenetic relationships of STEC O26:H11, clonal complex (CC) 29, in England to inform surveillance, and to assess the threat to public health. There were 502 STEC belonging to CC29 isolated between 2014 and 2019, of which 416 were from individual cases. The majority of isolates belonged to one of three major sequence types (STs), ST16 (n=37), ST21 (n=350) and ST29 (n=24). ST16 and ST29 were mainly isolated from cases reporting recent travel abroad. Within ST21, there were three main clades associated with domestic acquisition. All three domestic clades had Shiga toxin subtype gene (stx) profiles associated with causing severe clinical outcomes including STEC-HUS, specifically either stx1a, stx2a or stx1a\/stx2a. Isolates from the same patient, same household or same outbreak with an established source for the most part fell within 5-SNP single linkage clusters. There were 19 5-SNP community clusters, of which six were travel-associated and one was an outbreak of 16 cases caused by the consumption of contaminated salad leaves. Of the remaining 12 clusters, 9\/12 were either temporally or geographically related or both. Exposure to foodborne STEC O26:H11 ST21 capable of causing severe clinical outcomes, including STEC-HUS, is an emerging risk to public health in England. The lack of comprehensive surveillance of this STEC serotype is a concern, and there is a need to expand the implementation of methods capable of detecting STEC in local hospital settings.","280":"Mycobacterium tuberculosis is a known human pathogen that causes the airborne infectious disease tuberculosis (TB). Every year TB infects millions of people worldwide. The emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR), extensively drug resistant (XDR) and totally drug resistant (TDR) M. tuberculosis strains against the first- and second-line anti-TB drugs has created an urgent need for the development and implementation of new drug strategies. In this study, the complete genomes of 174 strains of M. tuberculosis are analysed to understand the evolution of molecular drug target (MDT) genes. Phylogenomic placements of M. tuberculosis strains depicted close association and temporal clustering. Selection pressure analysis by deducing the ratio of non-synonymous to synonymous substitution rates (dN\/dS) in 51 MDT genes of the 174 M. tuberculosis strains led to categorizing these genes into diversifying (D, dN\/dS&gt;0.70), moderately diversifying (MD, dN\/dS=0.35-0.70) and stabilized (S, dN\/dS&lt;0.35) genes. The genes rpsL, gidB, pncA and ahpC were identified as diversifying, and Rv0488, kasA, ndh, ethR, ethA, embR and ddn were identified as stabilized genes. Furthermore, sequence similarity networks were drawn that supported these divisions. In the multiple sequence alignments of diversifying and stabilized proteins, previously reported resistance mutations were checked to predict sensitive and resistant strains of M. tuberculosis. Finally, to delineate the potential of stabilized or least diversified genes\/proteins as anti-TB drug targets, protein-protein interactions of MDT proteins with human proteins were analysed. We predict that kasA (dN\/dS=0.29), a stabilized gene that encodes the most host-interacting protein, KasA, should serve as a potential drug target for the treatment of TB.","281":null,"282":null,"283":"Sequence similarity of pathogen genomes can infer the relatedness between isolates as the fewer genetic differences identified between pairs of isolates, the less time since divergence from a common ancestor. Clustering based on hierarchical single linkage clustering of pairwise SNP distances has been employed to detect and investigate outbreaks. Here, we evaluated the evidence-base for the interpretation of phylogenetic clusters of Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7. Whole genome sequences of 1193 isolates of STEC O157:H7 submitted to Public Health England between July 2015 and December 2016 were mapped to the Sakai reference strain. Hierarchical single linkage clustering was performed on the pairwise SNP difference between all isolates at descending distance thresholds. Cases with known epidemiological links fell within 5-SNP single linkage clusters. Five-SNP single linkage community clusters where an epidemiological link was not identified were more likely to be temporally and\/or geographically related than sporadic cases. Ten-SNP single linkage clusters occurred infrequently and were challenging to investigate as cases were few, and temporally and\/or geographically dispersed. A single linkage cluster threshold of 5-SNPs has utility for the detection of outbreaks linked to both persistent and point sources. Deeper phylogenetic analysis revealed that the distinction between domestic UK and imported isolates could be inferred at the sub-lineage level. Cases associated with domestically acquired infection that fall within clusters that are predominantly travel associated are likely to be caused by contaminated imported food.","284":"The Liverpool epidemic strain (LES) is an important transmissible clonal lineage of Pseudomonas aeruginosa that chronically infects the lungs of people with cystic fibrosis (CF). Previous studies have focused on the genomics of the LES in a limited number of isolates, mostly from one CF centre in the UK, and from studies highlighting identification of the LES in Canada. Here we significantly extend the current LES genome database by genome sequencing 91 isolates from multiple CF centres across the UK, and we describe the comparative genomics of this large collection of LES isolates from the UK and Canada. Phylogenetic analysis revealed that the 145 LES genomes analysed formed a distinct clonal lineage when compared with the wider P. aeruginosa population. Notably, the isolates formed two clades: one associated with isolates from Canada, and the other associated with UK isolates. Further analysis of the UK LES isolates revealed clustering by clinic geography. Where isolates clustered closely together, the association was often supported by clinical data linking isolates or patients. When compared with the earliest known isolate, LESB58 (from 1988), many UK LES isolates shared common loss-of-function mutations, such as in genes gltR and fleR. Other loss-of-function mutations identified in previous studies as common adaptations during CF chronic lung infections were also identified in multiple LES isolates. Analysis of the LES accessory genome (including genomic islands and prophages) revealed variations in the carriage of large genomic regions, with some evidence for shared genomic island\/prophage complement according to clinic location. Our study reveals divergence and adaptation during the spread of the LES, within the UK and between continents.","285":null,"286":"Compared to short-read sequencing data, long-read sequencing facilitates single contiguous de novo assemblies and characterization of the prophage region of the genome. Here, we describe our methodological approach to using Oxford Nanopore Technology (ONT) sequencing data to quantify genetic relatedness and to look for microevolutionary events in the core and accessory genomes to assess the within-outbreak variation of four genetically and epidemiologically linked isolates. Analysis of both Illumina and ONT sequencing data detected one SNP between the four sequences of the outbreak isolates. The variant calling procedure highlighted the importance of masking homologous sequences in the reference genome regardless of the sequencing technology used. Variant calling also highlighted the systemic errors in ONT base-calling and ambiguous mapping of Illumina reads that results in variations in the genetic distance when comparing one technology to the other. The prophage component of the outbreak strain was analysed, and nine of the 16 prophages showed some similarity to the prophage in the Sakai reference genome, including the stx2a-encoding phage. Prophage comparison between the outbreak isolates identified minor genome rearrangements in one of the isolates, including an inversion and a deletion event. The ability to characterize the accessory genome in this way is the first step to understanding the significance of these microevolutionary events and their impact on the evolutionary history, virulence and potentially the likely source and transmission of this zoonotic, foodborne pathogen.","287":null,"288":"The vaginal microbiome plays an important role in human health and species of vaginal bacteria have been associated with reproductive disease. Strain-level variation is also thought to be important, but the diversity, structure and evolutionary history of vaginal strains is not as well characterized. We developed and validated an approach to measure strain variation from metagenomic data based on SNPs within the core genomes for six species of vaginal bacteria: Gardnerella vaginalis, Lactobacillus crispatus, Lactobacillus iners, Lactobacillus jensenii, Lactobacillus gasseri and Atopobium vaginae. Despite inhabiting the same environment, strain diversity and structure varies across species. All species except L. iners are characterized by multiple distinct groups of strains. Even so, strain diversity is lower in the Lactobacillus species, consistent with a more recent colonization of the human vaginal microbiome. Both strain diversity and the frequency of multi-strain samples is related to species-level diversity of the microbiome in which they occur, suggesting similar ecological factors influencing diversity within the vaginal niche. We conclude that the structure of strain-level variation provides both the motivation and means of testing whether strain-level differences contribute to the function and health consequences of the vaginal microbiome.","289":null,"290":null,"291":null,"292":null,"293":"The mobilome plays a crucial role in bacterial adaptation and is therefore a starting point to understand and establish the gene flow occurring in the process of bacterial evolution. This is even more so if we consider that the mobilome of environmental bacteria can be the reservoir of genes that may later appear in the clinic. Recently, new genera have been proposed in the family Mycobacteriaceae, including the genus Mycolicibacterium, which encompasses dozens of species of agricultural, biotechnological, clinical and ecological importance, being ubiquitous in several environments. The current scenario in the Mycobacteriaceae mobilome has some bias because most of the characterized mycobacteriophages were isolated using a single host strain, and the few plasmids reported mainly relate to the genus Mycobacterium. To fill in the gaps in these issues, we performed a systematic in silico study of these mobile elements based on 242 available genomes of the genus Mycolicibacterium. The analyses identified 156 putative plasmids (19 conjugative, 45 mobilizable and 92 non-mobilizable) and 566 prophages in 86 and 229 genomes, respectively. Moreover, a contig was characterized by resembling an actinomycete integrative and conjugative element (AICE). Within this diversity of mobile genetic elements, there is a pool of genes associated with several canonical functions, in addition to adaptive traits, such as virulence and resistance to antibiotics and metals (mercury and arsenic). The type-VII secretion system was a common feature in the predicted plasmids, being associated with genes encoding virulent proteins (EsxA, EsxB, PE and PPE). In addition to the characterization of plasmids and prophages of the family Mycobacteriaceae, this study showed an abundance of these genetic elements in a dozen species of the genus Mycolicibacterium.","294":null,"295":"Background.

A. baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens and Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates were sequenced using the Illumina platform primarily to establish isolate relationships based on core-genome SNPs, MLST and antimicrobial resistance gene profiles. Representative isolates were selected for PacBio sequencing. Environmental metagenomic sequencing with Illumina was used to detect persistence of the outbreak strain in the hospital.Results. In response to a suspected polymicrobial outbreak between May to August of 2016, 28 CR-Ab (and 21 other MDR Gram-negative bacilli) were collected from Intensive Care Unit and Burns Unit patients and sent for WGS with a 7 day turn-around time in clinical reporting. All CR-Ab were sequence type (ST)1050 (Pasteur ST2) and within 10 SNPs apart, indicative of an ongoing outbreak, and distinct from historical CR-Ab isolates from the same hospital. Possible transmission routes between patients were identified on the basis of CR-Ab and K. pneumoniae SNP profiles. Continued WGS surveillance between 2016 to 2018 enabled suspected outbreak cases to be refuted, but a resurgence of the outbreak CR-Ab mid-2018 in the Burns Unit prompted additional screening. Environmental metagenomic sequencing identified the hospital plumbing as a potential source. Replacement of the plumbing and routine drain maintenance resulted in rapid resolution of the secondary outbreak and significant risk reduction with no discernable transmission in the Burns Unit since.Conclusion. We implemented a comprehensive WGS and metagenomics investigation that resolved a persistent CR-Ab outbreak in a critical care setting.","296":"Staphylococcus aureus chronic airway infection in patients with cystic fibrosis (CF) allows this pathogen to adapt over time in response to different selection pressures. We have previously shown that the main sequence types related to community-acquired methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) infections in Argentina - ST5 and ST30 - are also frequently isolated from the sputum of patients with CF, but in these patients they usually display multi-drug antimicrobial resistance. In this study, we sequenced the genomes of MRSA from four paediatric CF patients with the goal of identifying mutations among sequential isolates, especially those possibly related to antimicrobial resistance and virulence, which might contribute to the adaptation of the pathogen in the airways of patients with CF. Our results revealed genetic differences in sequential MRSA strains isolated from patients with CF in both their core and accessory genomes. Although the genetic adaptation of S. aureus was distinct in different hosts, we detected independent mutations in thyA, htrA, rpsJ and gyrA - which are known to have crucial roles in S. aureus virulence and antimicrobial resistance - in isolates recovered from multiple patients. Moreover, we identified allelic variants that were detected in all of the isolates recovered after a certain time point; these non-synonymous mutations were in genes associated with antimicrobial resistance, virulence, iron scavenging and oxidative stress resistance. In conclusion, our results provide evidence of genetic variability among sequential MRSA isolates that could be implicated in the adaptation of these strains during chronic CF airway infection.","297":null,"298":null,"299":"Streptococcus pneumoniae causes over one million deaths from lower respiratory infections per annum worldwide. Although mortality is very high in Southeast Asian countries, molecular epidemiological information remains unavailable for some countries. In this study, we report, for the first time, the whole-genome sequences and genetic profiles of pneumococcal strains isolated in Myanmar. We isolated 60 streptococcal strains from 300 children with acute respiratory infection at Yangon Children's Hospital in Myanmar. We obtained whole-genome sequences and identified the species, serotypes, sequence types, antimicrobial resistance (AMR) profiles, virulence factor profiles and pangenome structure using sequencing-based analysis. Average nucleotide identity analysis indicated that 58 strains were S. pneumoniae and the other 2 strains were Streptococcus mitis. The major serotype was 19F (11 strains), followed by 6E (6B genetic variant; 7 strains) and 15 other serotypes; 5 untypable strains were also detected. Multilocus sequence typing analysis revealed 39 different sequence types, including 11 novel ones. In addition, genetic profiling indicated that AMR genes and mutations spread among pneumococcal strains in Myanmar. A minimum inhibitory concentration assay indicated that several pneumococcal strains had acquired azithromycin and tetracycline resistance, whereas no strains were found to be resistant against levofloxacin and high-dose penicillin G. Phylogenetic and pangenome analysis showed various pneumococcal lineages and that the pneumococcal strains contain a rich and mobile gene pool, providing them with the ability to adapt to selective pressures. This molecular epidemiological information can help in tracking global infection and supporting AMR control in addition to public health interventions in Myanmar.","300":"The emergence of carbapenem resistance in Klebsiella pneumoniae represents a major global public health concern. Nosocomial outbreaks caused by multidrug-resistant K. pneumoniae are commonly reported to result in high morbidity and mortality due to limited treatment options. Between October 2019 and January 2020, two concurrent high-mortality nosocomial outbreaks occurred in a referral hospital in Ho Chi Minh City, Vietnam. We performed genome sequencing and phylogenetic analysis of eight K. pneumoniae isolates from infected patients and two environmental isolates for outbreak investigation. We identified two outbreaks caused by two distinct lineages of the international sequence type (ST) 16 clone, which displayed extensive drug resistance, including resistance to carbapenem and colistin. Carbapenem-resistant ST16 outbreak strains clustered tightly with previously described ST16 K. pneumoniae from other hospitals in Vietnam, suggesting local persistence and transmission of this particular clone in this setting. We found environmental isolates from a hospital bed and blood pressure cuff that were genetically linked to an outbreak case cluster, confirming the potential of high-touch surfaces as sources for nosocomial spread of K. pneumoniae. Further, we found colistin resistance caused by disruption of the mgrB gene by an ISL3-like element, and carbapenem resistance mediated by a transferable IncF\/bla OXA-181 plasmid carrying the ISL3-like element. Our study highlights the importance of coordinated efforts between clinical and molecular microbiologists and infection control teams to rapidly identify, investigate and contain nosocomial outbreaks. Routine surveillance with advanced sequencing technology should be implemented to strengthen hospital infection control and prevention measures.","301":null,"302":null,"303":"Although RNA helicases are essentially ubiquitous and perform roles in all stages of RNA metabolism, phylogenetic analysis of the DEAD (Asp-Glu-Ala-Asp)-box RNA helicase family in a single phylum has not been performed. Here, we performed a phylogenetic analysis on DEAD-box helicases from all currently available cyanobacterial genomes, comprising a total of 362 helicase protein sequences from 280 strains. DEAD-box helicases belonging to three distinct clades were observed. Two clades, the CsdA (cold shock DEAD-box A)-like and RhlE (RNA helicase E)-like helicases, cluster with the homologous proteins from Escherichia coli. The third clade, the CrhR (cyanobacterial RNA helicase Redox)-like helicases, is unique to cyanobacteria and characterized by a conserved sequence motif in the C-terminal extension. Restricted distribution is observed across cyanobacterial diversity with respect to both helicase type and strain. CrhR-like and CsdA-like helicases essentially never occur together, while RhlE always occurs with either a CrhR-like or CsdA-like helicase. CrhR-like and RhlE-like proteins occurred in filamentous cyanobacteria of the orders Nostocales, Oscillatoriales and Synechococcales. Similarly, CsdA- and RhlE-like proteins are restricted to unicellular cyanobacteria of the genera Cyanobium and Synechococcus. In addition, the unexpected occurrence of RhlE in two Synechococcus strains suggests recent acquisition and evolutionary divergence. This study, therefore, raises physiological and evolutionary questions as to why DEAD-box RNA helicases encoded in cyanobacterial lineages display restricted distributions, suggesting niches that require either CrhR or CsdA RNA helicase activity but not both. Extensive conservation of gene synteny surrounding the previously described rimO-crhR operon is also observed, indicating a role in the maintenance of photosynthesis. The analysis provides insights into the evolution, origin and dissemination of sequences within a single gene family to yield divergent functional roles.","304":null,"305":null,"306":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is one of the main microbial species colonizing the lungs of cystic fibrosis patients and is responsible for the decline in respiratory function. Despite the hostile pulmonary environment, P. aeruginosa is able to establish chronic infections thanks to its strong adaptive capacity. Various longitudinal studies have attempted to compare the strains of early infection with the adapted strains of chronic infection. Thanks to new '-omics' techniques, convergent genetic mutations, as well as transcriptomic and proteomic dysregulations have been identified. As a consequence of this evolution, the adapted strains of P. aeruginosa have particular phenotypes that promote persistent infection.","307":null,"308":null,"309":"Pre-existing colonization with Staphylococcus aureus or Klebsiella pneumoniae has been found to increase the risk of infection in intensive care patients. We previously conducted a longitudinal study to characterize colonization of these two organisms in patients admitted to intensive care in a hospital in southern Vietnam. Here, using genomic and phylogenetic analyses, we aimed to assess the contribution these colonizing organisms made to infections. We found that in the majority of patients infected with S. aureus or K. pneumoniae, the sequence type of the disease-causing (infecting) isolate was identical to that of corresponding colonizing organisms in the respective patient. Further in-depth analysis revealed that in patients infected by S. aureus ST188 and by K. pneumoniae ST17, ST23, ST25 and ST86, the infecting isolate was closely related to and exhibited limited genetic variation relative to pre-infection colonizing isolates. Multidrug-resistant S. aureus ST188 was identified as the predominant agent of colonization and infection. Colonization and infection by K. pneumoniae were characterized by organisms with limited antimicrobial resistance profiles but extensive repertoires of virulence genes. Our findings augment the understanding of the link between bacterial colonization and infection in a low-resource setting, and could facilitate the development of novel evidence-based approaches to prevent and treat infections in high-risk patients in intensive care.","310":null,"311":null,"312":null,"313":"Actinobacteria is a large and diverse phylum of bacteria that contains medically and ecologically relevant organisms. Many members are valuable sources of bioactive natural products and chemical precursors that are exploited in the clinic and made using the enzyme pathways encoded in their complex genomes. Whilst the number of sequenced genomes has increased rapidly in the last 20 years, the large size, complexity and high G+C content of many actinobacterial genomes means that the sequences remain incomplete and consist of large numbers of contigs with poor annotation, which hinders large-scale comparative genomic and evolutionary studies. To enable greater understanding and exploitation of actinobacterial genomes, specialized genomic databases must be linked to high-quality genome sequences. Here, we provide a curated database of 612 high-quality actinobacterial genomes from 80 genera, chosen to represent a broad phylogenetic group with equivalent genome re-annotation. Utilizing this database will provide researchers with a framework for evolutionary and metabolic studies, to enable a foundation for genome and metabolic engineering, to facilitate discovery of novel bioactive therapeutics and studies on gene family evolution.

Cryptosporidium hominis is the dominant pathogen in Africa, and genotyping at the glycoprotein 60 (gp60) gene has revealed a complex distribution of different subtypes across this continent. However, a comprehensive exploration of the metapopulation structure and evolution based on whole-genome data has yet to be performed. Here, we sequenced and analysed the genomes of 26 C. hominis isolates, representing different gp60 subtypes, collected at rural sites in Gabon, Ghana, Madagascar and Tanzania. Phylogenetic and cluster analyses based on single-nucleotide polymorphisms showed that isolates predominantly clustered by their country of origin, irrespective of their gp60 subtype. We found a significant isolation-by-distance signature that shows the importance of local transmission, but we also detected evidence of hybridization between isolates of different geographical regions. We identified 37 outlier genes with exceptionally high nucleotide diversity, and this group is significantly enriched for genes encoding extracellular proteins and signal peptides. Furthermore, these genes are found more often than expected in recombinant regions, and they show a distinct signature of positive or balancing selection. We conclude that: (1) the metapopulation structure of C. hominis can only be accurately captured by whole-genome analyses; (2) local anthroponotic transmission underpins the spread of this pathogen in Africa; (3) hybridization occurs between distinct geographical lineages; and (4) genetic introgression provides novel substrate for positive or balancing selection in genes involved in host-parasite coevolution.","319":null,"320":null,"321":null,"322":null,"323":null,"324":null,"325":"Mycobacteroides immunogenum is an emerging opportunistic pathogen implicated in nosocomial infections. Comparative genome analyses may provide better insights into its genomic structure, functions and evolution. The present analysis showed that M. immunogenum has an open pan-genome. Approximately 36.8% of putative virulence genes were identified in the accessory regions of M. immunogenum. Phylogenetic analyses revealed two potential novel subspecies of M. immunogenum, supported by evidence from ANIb (average nucleotide identity using blast) and GGDC (Genome to Genome Distance Calculator) analyses. We identified 74 genomic islands (GIs) in Subspecies 1 and 23 GIs in Subspecies 2. All Subspecies 2-harboured GIs were not found in Subspecies 1, indicating that they might have been acquired by Subspecies 2 after their divergence. Subspecies 2 has more defence genes than Subspecies 1, suggesting that it might be more resistant to the insertion of foreign DNA and probably explaining why Subspecies 2 has fewer GIs. Positive selection analysis suggest that M. immunogenum has a lower selection pressure compared to non-pathogenic mycobacteria. Thirteen genes were positively selected and many were involved in virulence.","326":"The identification of genes essential for a bacterium's growth reveals much about its basic physiology under different conditions. Bordetella pertussis, the causative agent of whooping cough, adopts both virulent and avirulent states through the activity of the two-component system, Bvg. The genes essential for B. pertussis growth in vitro were defined using transposon sequencing, for different Bvg-determined growth states. In addition, comparison of the insertion indices of each gene between Bvg phases identified those genes whose mutation exerted a significantly different fitness cost between phases. As expected, many of the genes identified as essential for growth in other bacteria were also essential for B. pertussis. However, the essentiality of some genes was dependent on Bvg. In particular, a number of key cell wall biosynthesis genes, including the entire mre\/mrd locus, were essential for growth of the avirulent (Bvg minus) phase but not the virulent (Bvg plus) phase. In addition, cell wall biosynthesis was identified as a fundamental process that when disrupted produced greater fitness costs for the Bvg minus phase compared to the Bvg plus phase. Bvg minus phase growth was more susceptible than Bvg plus phase growth to the cell wall-disrupting antibiotic ampicillin, demonstrating the increased susceptibility of the Bvg minus phase to disruption of cell wall synthesis. This Bvg-dependent conditional essentiality was not due to Bvg-regulation of expression of cell wall biosynthesis genes; suggesting that this fundamental process differs between the Bvg phases in B. pertussis and is more susceptible to disruption in the Bvg minus phase. The ability of a bacterium to modify its cell wall synthesis is important when considering the action of antibiotics, particularly if developing novel drugs targeting cell wall synthesis.","327":"Where classical epidemiology has proven to be inadequate for surveillance and control of foodborne pathogens, molecular epidemiology, using genomic typing methods, can add value. However, the analysis of whole genome sequencing (WGS) data varies widely and is not yet fully harmonised. We used genomic data on 494 Listeria monocytogenes isolates from ready-to-eat food products and food processing environments deposited in the strain collection of the German National Reference Laboratory to compare various procedures for WGS data analysis and to evaluate compatibility of results. Two different core genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST) schemes, different reference genomes in single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis and commercial as well as open-source software were compared. Correlation of allele distances from the different cgMLST approaches was high, ranging from 0.97 to 1, and unified thresholds yielded higher clustering concordance than scheme-specific thresholds. The number of detected SNP differences could be increased up to a factor of 3.9 using a specific reference genome compared with a general one. Additionally, specific reference genomes improved comparability of SNP analysis results obtained using different software tools. The use of a closed or a draft specific reference genome did not make a difference. The harmonisation of WGS data analysis will finally guarantee seamless data exchange, but, in the meantime, knowledge on threshold values that lead to comparable clustering of isolates by different methods may improve communication between laboratories. We therefore established a translation code between commonly applied cgMLST and SNP methods based on optimised clustering concordances. This code can work as a first filter to identify WGS-based typing matches resulting from different methods, which opens up a new perspective for data exchange and thereby accelerates time-critical analyses, such as in outbreak investigations.","328":"Between July 2018 and May 2019, Corynebacterium diphtheriae was isolated from eight patients with non-respiratory infections, seven of whom experienced homelessness and had stayed at shelters in King County, WA, USA. All isolates were microbiologically identified as nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae biovar mitis. Whole-genome sequencing confirmed that all case isolates were genetically related, associated with sequence type 445 and differing by fewer than 24 single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Compared to publicly available C. diphtheriae genomic data, these WA isolates formed a discrete cluster with SNP variation consistent with previously reported outbreaks. Virulence-related gene content variation within the highly related WA cluster isolates was also observed. These results indicated that genome characterization can readily support epidemiology of nontoxigenic C. diphtheriae.","329":null,"330":"Enterococcus faecium is a gut commensal of the gastro-digestive tract, but also known as nosocomial pathogen among hospitalized patients. Population genetics based on whole-genome sequencing has revealed that E. faecium strains from hospitalized patients form a distinct clade, designated clade A1, and that plasmids are major contributors to the emergence of nosocomial E. faecium. Here we further explored the adaptive evolution of E. faecium using a genome-wide co-evolution study (GWES) to identify co-evolving single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). We identified three genomic regions harbouring large numbers of SNPs in tight linkage that are not proximal to each other based on the completely assembled chromosome of the clade A1 reference hospital isolate AUS0004. Close examination of these regions revealed that they are located at the borders of four different types of large-scale genomic rearrangements, insertion sites of two different genomic islands and an IS30-like transposon. In non-clade A1 isolates, these regions are adjacent to each other and they lack the insertions of the genomic islands and IS30-like transposon. Additionally, among the clade A1 isolates there is one group of pet isolates lacking the genomic rearrangement and insertion of the genomic islands, suggesting a distinct evolutionary trajectory. In silico analysis of the biological functions of the genes encoded in three regions revealed a common link to a stress response. This suggests that these rearrangements may reflect adaptation to the stringent conditions in the hospital environment, such as antibiotics and detergents, to which bacteria are exposed. In conclusion, to our knowledge, this is the first study using GWES to identify genomic rearrangements, suggesting that there is considerable untapped potential to unravel hidden evolutionary signals from population genomic data.","331":null,"332":"The major human pathogen Streptococcus pyogenes shares an intimate evolutionary history with mobile genetic elements, which in many cases carry genes encoding bacterial virulence factors. During recent whole-genome sequencing of a longitudinal sample of S. pyogenes isolates in England, we identified a lineage within emm4 that clustered with the reference genome MEW427. Like MEW427, this lineage was characterized by substantial gene loss within all three prophage regions, compared to MGAS10750 and isolates outside of the MEW427-like lineage. Gene loss primarily affected lysogeny, replicative and regulatory modules, and to a lesser and more variable extent, structural genes. Importantly, prophage-encoded superantigen and DNase genes were retained in all isolates. In isolates where the prophage elements were complete, like MGAS10750, they could be induced experimentally, but not in MEW427-like isolates with degraded prophages. We also found gene loss within the chromosomal island SpyCIM4 of MEW427-like isolates, although surprisingly, the SpyCIM4 element could not be experimentally induced in either MGAS10750-like or MEW427-like isolates. This did not, however, appear to abolish expression of the mismatch repair operon, within which this element resides. The inclusion of further emm4 genomes in our analyses ratified our observations and revealed an international emm4 lineage characterized by prophage degradation. Intriguingly, the USA population of emm4 S. pyogenes appeared to constitute predominantly MEW427-like isolates, whereas the UK population comprised both MEW427-like and MGAS10750-like isolates. The degraded and cryptic nature of these elements may have important phenotypic and fitness ramifications for emm4 S. pyogenes, and the geographical distribution of this lineage raises interesting questions on the population dynamics of the genotype.","333":null,"334":"Neisseria gonorrhoeae, the bacterium responsible for the sexually transmitted disease gonorrhoea, has shown an extraordinary ability to develop antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to multiple classes of antimicrobials. With no available vaccine, managing N. gonorrhoeae infections demands effective preventive measures, antibiotic treatment and epidemiological surveillance. The latter two are progressively being supported by the generation of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) data on behalf of national and international surveillance programmes. In this context, this study aims to perform N. gonorrhoeae clustering into genogroups based on WGS data, for enhanced prospective laboratory surveillance. Particularly, it aims to identify the major circulating WGS-genogroups in Europe and to establish a relationship between these and AMR. Ultimately, it enriches public databases by contributing with WGS data from Portuguese isolates spanning 15 years of surveillance. A total of 3791 carefully inspected N. gonorrhoeae genomes from isolates collected across Europe were analysed using a gene-by-gene approach (i.e. using cgMLST). Analysis of cluster composition and stability allowed the classification of isolates into a two-step hierarchical genogroup level determined by two allelic distance thresholds revealing cluster stability. Genogroup clustering in general agreed with available N. gonorrhoeae typing methods [i.e. MLST (multilocus sequence typing), NG-MAST (N. gonorrhoeae multi-antigen sequence typing) and PubMLST core-genome groups], highlighting the predominant genogroups circulating in Europe, and revealed that the vast majority of the genogroups present a dominant AMR profile. Additionally, a non-static gene-by-gene approach combined with a more discriminatory threshold for potential epidemiological linkage enabled us to match data with previous reports on outbreaks or transmission chains. In conclusion, this genogroup assignment allows a comprehensive analysis of N. gonorrhoeae genetic diversity and the identification of the WGS-based genogroups circulating in Europe, while facilitating the assessment (and continuous monitoring) of their frequency, geographical dispersion and potential association with specific AMR signatures. This strategy may benefit public-health actions through the prioritization of genogroups to be controlled, the identification of emerging resistance carriage, and the potential facilitation of data sharing and communication.","335":null,"336":null,"337":"Bacterial genome-wide association studies (bGWAS) capture associations between genomic variation and phenotypic variation.

Hogwash additionally contains two burden testing approaches to perform gene or pathway analysis to improve power and increase convergence detection for related but weakly penetrant genotypes. To identify optimal use cases, we applied hogwash to data simulated with a variety of phylogenetic signals and convergence distributions.

Here, we aim to shed light on the provenance and expansion of this ST. ST-7827 was found to be polyphyletic, but the majority of members belonged to a monophyletic clade we termed PopPUNK cluster 7827 (PC-7827). In Norway, both PC-7827 and ST-7827 isolates were almost exclusively isolated from men. Phylogeographical analyses demonstrated an Asian origin of the genogroup, with multiple inferred exports to Europe and the USA. The genogroup was uniformly resistant to fluoroquinolones, and associated with reduced susceptibility to both azithromycin and the extended-spectrum cephalosporins (ESCs) cefixime and ceftriaxone. From a genetic background including the penA allele 13.001, associated with reduced ESC susceptibility, we identified repeated events of acquisition of porB alleles associated with further reduction in ceftriaxone susceptibility. Transmission of the strain was significantly reduced in Norway in 2019, but our results indicate the existence of a recently established global reservoir. The worrisome drug-resistance profile and rapid emergence of PC-7827 calls for close monitoring of the situation.","339":null,"340":"Complete genomes of microbial pathogens are essential for the phylogenomic analyses that increasingly underpin core public health laboratory activities.

However, there is a paucity of genomic data available for this organism. This study introduces 12 newly sequenced draft genome assemblies, boosting the cohort of examined isolates by fourfold and cataloguing the intraspecific genomic diversity of the organism more comprehensively. We used several in silico techniques to define a core genome of 1751 genes and qualitatively and quantitatively examined the intraspecific species boundary using phylogenetic analysis and average nucleotide identity, before contextualizing this diversity against other members of the genus Brachyspira. Our study revealed that an additional isolate that was unable to be species typed against any other Brachyspira lacked putative virulence factors present in all other isolates. Finally, we quantified that homologous recombination has as great an effect on the evolution of the core genome of the B. pilosicoli as random mutation (r\/m=1.02). Comparative genomics has informed Brachyspira diversity, population structure, host specificity and virulence. The data presented here can be used to contribute to developing advanced screening methods, diagnostic assays and prophylactic vaccines against this zoonotic pathogen.","342":"Outbreaks of tuberculosis (TB) - such as the large isoniazid-resistant outbreak centred on London, UK, which originated in 1995 - provide excellent opportunities to model transmission of this devastating disease. Transmission chains for TB are notoriously difficult to ascertain, but mathematical modelling approaches, combined with whole-genome sequencing data, have strong potential to contribute to transmission analyses. Using such data, we aimed to reconstruct transmission histories for the outbreak using a Bayesian approach, and to use machine-learning techniques with patient-level data to identify the key covariates associated with transmission. By using our transmission reconstruction method that accounts for phylogenetic uncertainty, we are able to identify 21 transmission events with reasonable confidence, 9 of which have zero SNP distance, and a maximum distance of 3. Patient age, alcohol abuse and history of homelessness were found to be the most important predictors of being credible TB transmitters.","343":null,"344":"Carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumoniae (CRKP) remains a major clinical pathogen and public health threat with few therapeutic options. The mobilome, resistome, methylome, virulome and phylogeography of CRKP in South Africa and globally were characterized. CRKP collected in 2018 were subjected to antimicrobial susceptibility testing, screening by multiplex PCR, genotyping by repetitive element palindromic (REP)-PCR, plasmid size, number, incompatibility and mobility analyses, and PacBio's SMRT sequencing (n=6). There were 56 multidrug-resistant CRKP, having bla OXA-48-like and bla NDM-1\/7 carbapenemases on self-transmissible IncF, A\/C, IncL\/M and IncX3 plasmids endowed with prophages, traT, resistance islands, and type I and II restriction modification systems (RMS). Plasmids and clades detected in this study were respectively related to globally established\/disseminated plasmids clades\/clones, evincing transboundary horizontal and vertical dissemination. Reduced susceptibility to colistin occurred in 23 strains. Common clones included ST307, ST607, ST17, ST39 and ST3559. IncFIIk virulent plasmid replicon was present in 56 strains. Whole-genome sequencing of six strains revealed least 41 virulence genes, extensive ompK36 mutations, and four different K- and O-loci types: KL2, KL25, KL27, KL102, O1, O2, O4 and O5. Types I, II and III RMS, conferring m6A (GATC, GATGNNNNNNTTG, CAANNNNNNCATC motifs) and m4C (CCWGG) modifications on chromosomes and plasmids, were found. The nature of plasmid-mediated, clonal and multi-clonal dissemination of blaOXA-48-like and blaNDM-1 mirrors epidemiological trends observed for closely related plasmids and sequence types internationally. Worryingly, the presence of both bla OXA-48 and bla NDM-1 in the same isolates was observed. Plasmid-mediated transmission of RMS, virulome and prophages influence bacterial evolution, epidemiology, pathogenicity and resistance, threatening infection treatment. The influence of RMS on antimicrobial and bacteriophage therapy needs urgent investigation.","345":"Species belonging to the family Lactobacillaceae are found in highly diverse environments and play an important role in fermented foods and probiotic products. Many of these species have been individually reported to harbour plasmids that encode important genes. In this study, we performed comparative genomic analysis of publicly available data for 512 plasmids from 282 strains represented by 51 species of this family and correlated the genomic features of plasmids with the ecological niches in which these species are found. Two-thirds of the species had at least one plasmid-harbouring strain. Plasmid abundance and GC content were significantly lower in vertebrate-adapted species as compared to nomadic and free-living species. Hierarchical clustering highlighted the distinct nature of plasmids from the nomadic and free-living species than those from the vertebrate-adapted species. EggNOG-assisted functional annotation revealed that genes associated with transposition, conjugation, DNA repair and recombination, exopolysaccharide production, metal ion transport, toxin-antitoxin system, and stress tolerance were significantly enriched on the plasmids of the nomadic and in some cases nomadic and free-living species. On the other hand, genes related to anaerobic metabolism, ABC transporters and the major facilitator superfamily were overrepresented on the plasmids of the vertebrate-adapted species. These genomic signatures correlate with the comparatively nutrient-depleted, stressful and dynamic environments of nomadic and free-living species and nutrient-rich and anaerobic environments of vertebrate-adapted species. Thus, these results indicate the contribution of the plasmids in the adaptation of lactobacilli to their respective habitats. This study also underlines the potential application of these plasmids in improving the technological and probiotic properties of lactic acid bacteria.","346":"Bacterial wilt caused by the Ralstonia solanacearum species complex (RSSC) threatens the cultivation of important crops worldwide. We sequenced 30 RSSC phylotype I (R. pseudosolanacearum) strains isolated from pepper (Capsicum annuum) and tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) across the Republic of Korea. These isolates span the diversity of phylotype I, have extensive effector repertoires and are subject to frequent recombination. Recombination hotspots among South Korean phylotype I isolates include multiple predicted contact-dependent inhibition loci, suggesting that microbial competition plays a significant role in Ralstonia evolution. Rapid diversification of secreted effectors presents challenges for the development of disease-resistant plant varieties. We identified potential targets for disease resistance breeding by testing for allele-specific host recognition of T3Es present among South Korean phyloype I isolates. The integration of pathogen population genomics and molecular plant pathology contributes to the development of location-specific disease control and development of plant cultivars with durable resistance to relevant threats.","347":null,"348":"Deinococcus metallilatus MA1002 was exposed to ultraviolet radiation to generate mutants with enhanced biofilm production. Two strains (nos 5 and 6) were then selected based on their high biofilm formation, as well as their possession of higher concentrations of extracellular matrix components (eDNA, protein and saccharides) than the wild-type (WT). Genomic sequencing revealed the presence of large genome deletions in a secondary chromosome in the mutants. Expression analyses of the WT and mutant strains indicated the upregulation of genes associated with exopolysaccharide synthesis and stress response. The mutant strains showed high mortality in glucose-supplemented (TYG) medium; however, cell death and biofilm formation were not increased in mutant cells grown under acetate- or glyoxylate-added media, suggesting that metabolic toxicity during glucose metabolism induced a high rate of cell death but improved biofilm formation in mutant strains. In damaged cells, eDNAs contributed to the enhanced biofilm formation of D. metallilatus.","349":"Accumulating evidence suggests that humans could be considered as holobionts in which the gut microbiota play essential functions. Initial metagenomic studies reported a pattern of shared genes in the gut microbiome of different individuals, leading to the definition of the minimal gut metagenome as the set of microbial genes necessary for homeostasis and present in all healthy individuals. This study analyses the minimal gut metagenome of the most comprehensive dataset available, including individuals from agriculturalist and industrialist societies, also embodying highly diverse ethnic and geographical backgrounds. The outcome, based on metagenomic predictions for community composition data, resulted in a minimal metagenome comprising 3412 genes, mapping to 1856 reactions and 128 metabolic pathways predicted to occur across all individuals. These results were substantiated by the analysis of two additional datasets describing the microbial community compositions of larger Western cohorts, as well as a substantial shotgun metagenomics dataset. Subsequent analyses showed the plausible metabolic complementarity provided by the minimal gut metagenome to the human genome.","350":null,"351":null,"352":"Agrobacterium tumefaciens is an efficient tool for creating transgenic host plants.

In this study, the distribution and classification of chemotactic genes in the model A. tumefaciens C58 and 21 other strains were annotated. Local blast was used for comparative genomics, and hmmer was used for predicting protein domains. Chemotactic phenotypes for knockout mutants of ternary signalling complexes in A. tumefaciens C58 were evaluated using a swim agar plate. A major cluster, in which chemotaxis genes were consistently organized as MCP (methyl-accepting chemotaxis protein), CheS, CheY1, CheA, CheR, CheB, CheY2 and CheD, was found in A. tumefaciens, but two coupling CheW proteins were located outside the 'che' cluster. In the ternary signalling complexes, the absence of MCP atu0514 significantly impaired A. tumefaciens chemotaxis, and the absence of CheA (atu0517) or the deletion of both CheWs abolished chemotaxis. A total of 465 MCPs were found in the 22 strains, and the cytoplasmic domains of these MCPs were composed of 38 heptad repeats. A high homology was observed between the chemotactic systems of the 22 A. tumefaciens strains with individual differences in the gene and receptor protein distributions, possibly related to their ecological niches. This preliminary study demonstrates the chemotactic system of A. tumefaciens, and provides some reference for A. tumefaciens sensing and chemotaxis to exogenous signals.","353":"Epidemic and pandemic clones of bacterial pathogens with distinct characteristics continually emerge, replacing those previously dominant through mechanisms that remain poorly characterized. Here, whole-genome-sequencing-powered epidemiology linked horizontal transfer of a virulence gene, sopE, to the emergence and clonal expansion of a new epidemic Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium (S. Typhimurium) clone. The sopE gene is sporadically distributed within the genus Salmonella and rare in S. enterica Typhimurium lineages, but was acquired multiple times during clonal expansion of the currently dominant pandemic monophasic S. Typhimurium sequence type (ST) 34 clone. Ancestral state reconstruction and time-scaled phylogenetic analysis indicated that sopE was not present in the common ancestor of the epidemic clade, but later acquisition resulted in increased clonal expansion of sopE-containing clones that was temporally associated with emergence of the epidemic, consistent with increased fitness. The sopE gene was mainly associated with a temperate bacteriophage mTmV, but recombination with other bacteriophage and apparent horizontal gene transfer of the sopE gene cassette resulted in distribution among at least four mobile genetic elements within the monophasic S. enterica Typhimurium ST34 epidemic clade. The mTmV prophage lysogenic transfer to other S. enterica serovars in vitro was limited, but included the common pig-associated S. enterica Derby (S. Derby). This may explain mTmV in S. Derby co-circulating on farms with monophasic S. Typhimurium ST34, highlighting the potential for further transfer of the sopE virulence gene in nature. We conclude that whole-genome epidemiology pinpoints potential drivers of evolutionary and epidemiological dynamics during pathogen emergence, and identifies targets for subsequent research in epidemiology and bacterial pathogenesis.","354":"Campylobacter concisus is an emerging enteric pathogen that is associated with several gastrointestinal diseases, such as inflammatory bowel disease (IBD), which includes Crohn's disease (CD) and ulcerative colitis (UC). Currently, only three complete C. concisus genomes are available and more complete C. concisus genomes are needed in order to better understand the genomic features and pathogenicity of this emerging pathogen. DNA extracted from 22 C. concisus strains were subjected to Oxford Nanopore genome sequencing. Complete genome assembly was performed using Nanopore genome data in combination with previously reported short-read Illumina data. Genome features of complete C. concisus genomes were analysed using bioinformatic tools. The enteric disease associations of C. concisus plasmids were examined using 239 C. concisus strains and confirmed using PCRs. Proteomic analysis was used to examine T6SS secreted proteins. We successfully obtained 13 complete C. concisus genomes in this study. Analysis of 16 complete C. concisus genomes (3 from public databases) identified multiple novel plasmids. pSma1 plasmid was found to be associated with severe UC. Sec-SRP, Tat and T6SS were found to be the main secretion systems in C. concisus and proteomic data showed a functional T6SS despite the lack of ClpV. T4SS was found in 25% of complete C. concisus genomes. This study also found that GS2 strains had larger genomes and higher GC content than GS1 strains and more often had plasmids. In conclusion, this study provides fundamental genomic data for understanding C. concisus plasmids, genomospecies features, evolution, secretion systems and pathogenicity.","355":"We report on the combination of chemical mutagenesis, azithromycin selection and next-generation sequencing (Mut-Seq) for the identification of small nucleotide variants that decrease the susceptibility of Streptococcus pneumoniae to the macrolide antibiotic azithromycin. Mutations in the 23S ribosomal RNA or in ribosomal proteins can confer resistance to macrolides and these were detected by Mut-Seq. By concentrating on recurrent variants, we could associate mutations in genes implicated in the metabolism of glutamine with decreased azithromycin susceptibility among S. pneumoniae mutants. Glutamine synthetase catalyses the transformation of glutamate and ammonium into glutamine and its chemical inhibition is shown to sensitize S. pneumoniae to antibiotics. A mutation affecting the ribosomal-binding site of a putative ribonuclease J2 is also shown to confer low-level resistance. Mut-Seq has the potential to reveal chromosomal changes enabling high resistance as well as novel events conferring more subtle phenotypes.","356":"Bacteriophage defences are divided into innate and adaptive systems. Serratia sp. ATCC 39006 has three CRISPR-Cas adaptive immune systems, but its innate immune repertoire is unknown. Here, we re-sequenced and annotated the Serratia genome and predicted its toxin-antitoxin (TA) systems. TA systems can provide innate phage defence through abortive infection by causing infected cells to 'shut down', limiting phage propagation. To assess TA system function on a genome-wide scale, we utilized transposon insertion and RNA sequencing. Of the 32 TA systems predicted bioinformatically, 4 resembled pseudogenes and 11 were demonstrated to be functional based on transposon mutagenesis. Three functional systems belonged to the poorly characterized but widespread, AbiE, abortive infection\/TA family. AbiE is a type IV TA system with a predicted nucleotidyltransferase toxin. To investigate the mode of action of this toxin, we measured the transcriptional response to AbiEii expression. We observed dysregulated levels of tRNAs and propose that the toxin targets tRNAs resulting in bacteriostasis. A recent report on a related toxin shows this occurs through addition of nucleotides to tRNA(s). This study has demonstrated the utility of functional genomics for probing TA function in a high-throughput manner, defined the TA repertoire in Serratia and shown the consequences of AbiE induction.","357":"Plasmids are the key element in horizontal gene transfer in the microbial community. Recently, a large number of experimental and computational methods have been developed to obtain the plasmidomes of microbial communities. Distinguishing transmissible plasmid sequences, which are derived from conjugative or at least mobilizable plasmids, from non-transmissible plasmid sequences in the plasmidome is essential for understanding the diversity of plasmids and how they regulate the microbial community. Unfortunately, due to the highly fragmented characteristics of DNA sequences in the plasmidome, effective identification methods are lacking. In this work, we used information entropy from information theory to assess the randomness of synonymous codon usage over 4424 plasmid genomes. The results showed that for all amino acids, the choice of a synonymous codon in conjugative and mobilizable plasmids is more random than that in non-transmissible plasmids, indicating that transmissible plasmids have different sequence signatures from non-transmissible plasmids. Inspired by this phenomenon, we further developed a novel algorithm named PlasTrans. PlasTrans takes the triplet code sequences and base sequences of plasmid DNA fragments as input and uses the convolutional neural network of the deep learning technique to further extract the more complex signatures of the plasmid sequences and identify the conjugative and mobilizable DNA fragments. Tests showed that PlasTrans could achieve an AUC of as high as 84-91%, even though the fragments only contained hundreds of base pairs. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first quantitative analysis of the difference in sequence signatures between transmissible and non-transmissible plasmids, and we developed the first tool to perform transferability annotation for DNA fragments in the plasmidome. We expect that PlasTrans will be a useful tool for researchers who analyse the properties of novel plasmids in the microbial community and horizontal gene transfer, especially the spread of resistance genes and virulence factors associated with plasmids.

Endospores enable bacteria to survive under unfavourable growth conditions and germinate when environmental conditions are favourable again. Spore-coat proteins are found in a multilayered proteinaceous structure encasing the spore core and the cortex. They are involved in coat assembly, cortex synthesis and germination. Here, we aimed to determine the diversity and evolutionary processes that have influenced spore-coat genes in various spore-forming species of Bacillales using an in silico approach. For this, we used sequence similarity searching algorithms to determine the diversity of coat genes across 161 genomes of Bacillales. The results suggest that among Bacillales, there is a well-conserved core genome, composed mainly by morphogenetic coat proteins and spore-coat proteins involved in germination. However, some spore-coat proteins are taxa-specific. The best-conserved genes among different species may promote adaptation to changeable environmental conditions. Because most of the Bacillus species harbour complete or almost complete sets of spore-coat genes, we focused on this genus in greater depth. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed eight monophyletic groups in the Bacillus genus, of which three are newly discovered. We estimated the selection pressures acting over spore-coat genes in these monophyletic groups using classical and modern approaches and detected horizontal gene transfer (HGT) events, which have been further confirmed by scanning the genomes to find traces of insertion sequences. Although most of the genes are under purifying selection, there are several cases with individual sites evolving under positive selection. Finally, the HGT results confirm that sporulation is an ancestral feature in Bacillus.","359":null,"360":null,"361":null,"362":null,"363":null,"364":null,"365":null,"366":null,"367":"Although several studies have investigated genetic diversity of Leishmania infantum in North Africa, genome-wide analyses are lacking. Here, we conducted comparative analyses of nuclear and mitochondrial genomes of seven L. infantum isolates from Tunisia with the aim to gain insight into factors that drive genomic and phenotypic adaptation. Isolates were from cured (n=4) and recurrent (n=3) visceral leishmaniasis (VL) cases, originating from northern (n=2) and central (n=5) Tunisia, where respectively stable and emerging VL foci are observed. All isolates from relapsed patients were from Kairouan governorate (Centre); one showing resistance to the anti-leishmanial drug Meglumine antimoniate. Nuclear genome diversity of the isolates was analysed by comparison to the L. infantum JPCM5 reference genome. Kinetoplast maxi and minicircle sequences (1 and 59, respectively) were extracted from unmapped reads and identified by blast analysis against public data sets. The genome variation analysis grouped together isolates from the same geographical origins. Strains from the North were very different from the reference showing more than 34 587 specific single nucleotide variants, with one isolate representing a full genetic hybrid as judged by variant frequency. Composition of minicircle classes within isolates corroborated this geographical population structure. Read depth analysis revealed several significant gene copy number variations correlating with either geographical origin (amastin and Hsp33 genes) or relapse (CLN3 gene). However, no specific gene copy number variation was found in the drug-resistant isolate. In contrast, resistance was associated with a specific minicircle pattern suggesting Leishmania mitochondrial DNA as a potential novel source for biomarker discovery.","368":"The transcription factor PdhR has been recognized as the master regulator of the pyruvate catabolism pathway in Escherichia coli, including both NAD-linked oxidative decarboxylation of pyruvate to acetyl-CoA by PDHc (pyruvate dehydrogenase complex) and respiratory electron transport of NADH to oxygen by Ndh-CyoABCD enzymes. To identify the whole set of regulatory targets under the control of pyruvate-sensing PdhR, we performed genomic SELEX (gSELEX) screening in vitro. A total of 35 PdhR-binding sites were identified along the E. coli K-12 genome, including previously identified targets. Possible involvement of PdhR in regulation of the newly identified target genes was analysed in detail by gel shift assay, RT-qPCR and Northern blot analysis. The results indicated the participation of PdhR in positive regulation of fatty acid degradation genes and negative regulation of cell mobility genes. In fact, GC analysis indicated an increase in free fatty acids in the mutant lacking PdhR. We propose that PdhR is a bifunctional global regulator for control of a total of 16-23 targets, including not only the genes involved in central carbon metabolism but also some genes for the surrounding pyruvate-sensing cellular pathways such as fatty acid degradation and flagella formation. The activity of PdhR is controlled by pyruvate, the key node between a wide variety of metabolic pathways, including generation of metabolic energy and cell building blocks.","369":"Trimethoprim is a synthetic antibacterial agent that targets folate biosynthesis by competitively binding to the di-hydrofolate reductase enzyme (DHFR). Trimethoprim is often administered synergistically with sulfonamide, another chemotherapeutic agent targeting the di-hydropteroate synthase (DHPS) enzyme in the same pathway. Clinical resistance to both drugs is widespread and mediated by enzyme variants capable of performing their biological function without binding to these drugs. These mutant enzymes were assumed to have arisen after the discovery of these synthetic drugs, but recent work has shown that genes conferring resistance to sulfonamide were present in the bacterial pangenome millions of years ago. Here, we apply phylogenetics and comparative genomics methods to study the largest family of mobile trimethoprim-resistance genes (dfrA). We show that most of the dfrA genes identified to date map to two large clades that likely arose from independent mobilization events. In contrast to sulfonamide resistance (sul) genes, we find evidence of recurrent mobilization in dfrA genes. Phylogenetic evidence allows us to identify novel dfrA genes in the emerging pathogen Acinetobacter baumannii, and we confirm their resistance phenotype in vitro. We also identify a cluster of dfrA homologues in cryptic plasmid and phage genomes, but we show that these enzymes do not confer resistance to trimethoprim. Our methods also allow us to pinpoint the chromosomal origin of previously reported dfrA genes, and we show that many of these ancient chromosomal genes also confer resistance to trimethoprim. Our work reveals that trimethoprim resistance predated the clinical use of this chemotherapeutic agent, but that novel mutations have likely also arisen and become mobilized following its widespread use within and outside the clinic. Hence, this work confirms that resistance to novel drugs may already be present in the bacterial pangenome, and stresses the importance of rapid mobilization as a fundamental element in the emergence and global spread of resistance determinants.","370":null,"371":"The cyanobacterium Nostoc punctiforme can form lipid droplets (LDs), internal inclusions containing triacylglycerols, carotenoids and alkanes. LDs are enriched for a 17 carbon-long alkane in N. punctiforme, and it has been shown that the overexpression of the aar and ado genes results in increased LD and alkane production. To identify transcriptional adaptations associated with increased alkane production, we performed comparative transcriptomic analysis of an alkane overproduction strain. RNA-seq data identified a large number of highly upregulated genes in the overproduction strain, including genes potentially involved in rRNA processing, mycosporine-glycine production and synthesis of non-ribosomal peptides, including nostopeptolide A. Other genes encoding helical carotenoid proteins, stress-induced proteins and those for microviridin synthesis were also upregulated. Construction of N. punctiforme strains with several upregulated genes or operons on multi-copy plasmids resulted in reduced alkane accumulation, indicating possible negative regulators of alkane production. A strain containing four genes for microviridin biosynthesis completely lost the ability to synthesize LDs. This strain exhibited wild-type growth and lag phase recovery under standard conditions, and slightly faster growth under high light. The transcriptional changes associated with increased alkane production identified in this work will provide the basis for future experiments designed to use cyanobacteria as a production platform for biofuel or high-value hydrophobic products.","372":null,"373":"As genome sequencing efforts are unveiling the genetic diversity of the biosphere with an unprecedented speed, there is a need to accurately describe the structural and functional properties of groups of extant species whose genomes have been sequenced, as well as their inferred ancestors, at any given taxonomic level of their phylogeny. Elaborate approaches for the reconstruction of ancestral states at the sequence level have been developed, subsequently augmented by methods based on gene content. While these approaches of sequence or gene-content reconstruction have been successfully deployed, there has been less progress on the explicit inference of functional properties of ancestral genomes, in terms of metabolic pathways and other cellular processes. Herein, we describe PathTrace, an efficient algorithm for parsimony-based reconstructions of the evolutionary history of individual metabolic pathways, pivotal representations of key functional modules of cellular function. The algorithm is implemented as a five-step process through which pathways are represented as fuzzy vectors, where each enzyme is associated with a taxonomic conservation value derived from the phylogenetic profile of its protein sequence. The method is evaluated with a selected benchmark set of pathways against collections of genome sequences from key data resources. By deploying a pangenome-driven approach for pathway sets, we demonstrate that the inferred patterns are largely insensitive to noise, as opposed to gene-content reconstruction methods. In addition, the resulting reconstructions are closely correlated with the evolutionary distance of the taxa under study, suggesting that a diligent selection of target pangenomes is essential for maintaining cohesiveness of the method and consistency of the inference, serving as an internal control for an arbitrary selection of queries. The PathTrace method is a first step towards the large-scale analysis of metabolic pathway evolution and our deeper understanding of functional relationships reflected in emerging pangenome collections.","374":"Increasing contact between humans and non-human primates provides an opportunity for the transfer of potential pathogens or antimicrobial resistance between host species. We have investigated genomic diversity and antimicrobial resistance in Escherichia coli isolates from four species of non-human primates in the Gambia: Papio papio (n=22), Chlorocebus sabaeus (n=14), Piliocolobus badius (n=6) and Erythrocebus patas (n=1). We performed Illumina whole-genome sequencing on 101 isolates from 43 stools, followed by nanopore long-read sequencing on 11 isolates. We identified 43 sequence types (STs) by the Achtman scheme (ten of which are novel), spanning five of the eight known phylogroups of E. coli. The majority of simian isolates belong to phylogroup B2 - characterized by strains that cause human extraintestinal infections - and encode factors associated with extraintestinal disease. A subset of the B2 strains (ST73, ST681 and ST127) carry the pks genomic island, which encodes colibactin, a genotoxin associated with colorectal cancer. We found little antimicrobial resistance and only one example of multi-drug resistance among the simian isolates. Hierarchical clustering showed that simian isolates from ST442 and ST349 are closely related to isolates recovered from human clinical cases (differences in 50 and 7 alleles, respectively), suggesting recent exchange between the two host species. Conversely, simian isolates from ST73, ST681 and ST127 were distinct from human isolates, while five simian isolates belong to unique core-genome ST complexes - indicating novel diversity specific to the primate niche. Our results are of planetary health importance, considering the increasing contact between humans and wild non-human primates.","375":null,"376":null,"377":null,"378":"Commensal non-pathogenic Neisseria spp. live within the human host alongside the pathogenic Neisseria meningitidis and Neisseria gonorrhoeae and due to natural competence, horizontal gene transfer within the genus is possible and has been observed. Four distinct Neisseria spp. isolates taken from the throats of two human volunteers have been assessed here using a combination of microbiological and bioinformatics techniques. Three of the isolates have been identified as Neisseria subflava biovar perflava and one as Neisseria cinerea. Specific gene clusters have been identified within these commensal isolate genome sequences that are believed to encode a Type VI Secretion System, a newly identified CRISPR system, a Type IV Secretion System unlike that in other Neisseria spp., a hemin transporter, and a haem acquisition and utilization system. This investigation is the first to investigate these systems in either the non-pathogenic or pathogenic Neisseria spp. In addition, the N. subflava biovar perflava possess previously unreported capsule loci and sequences have been identified in all four isolates that are similar to genes seen within the pathogens that are associated with virulence. These data from the four commensal isolates provide further evidence for a Neisseria spp. gene pool and highlight the presence of systems within the commensals with functions still to be explored.","379":null,"380":null,"381":"Bradyrhizobium are abundant soil bacteria and the major symbiont of legumes. The recent availability of Bradyrhizobium genome sequences provides a large source of information for analysis of symbiotic traits. In this study, we investigated the evolutionary dynamics of the nodulation genes (nod) and their relationship with the genes encoding type III secretion systems (T3SS) and their effectors among bradyrhizobia. Based on the comparative analysis of 146 Bradyrhizobium genome sequences, we identified six different types of T3SS gene clusters. The two predominant cluster types are designated RhcIa and RhcIb and both belong to the RhcI-T3SS family previously described in other rhizobia. They are found in 92\/146 strains, most of them also containing nod genes. RhcIa and RhcIb gene clusters differ in the genes they carry: while the translocon-encoding gene nopX is systematically found in strains containing RhcIb, the nopE and nopH genes are specifically conserved in strains containing RhcIa, suggesting that these last two genes might functionally substitute nopX and play a role related to effector translocation. Phylogenetic analysis suggests that bradyrhizobia simultaneously gained nod and RhcI-T3SS gene clusters via horizontal transfer or subsequent vertical inheritance of a symbiotic island containing both. Sequence similarity searches for known Nop effector proteins in bradyrhizobial proteomes revealed the absence of a so-called core effectome, i.e. that no effector is conserved among all Bradyrhizobium strains. However, NopM and SUMO proteases were found to be the main effector families, being represented in the majority of the genus. This study indicates that bradyrhizobial T3SSs might play a more significant symbiotic role than previously thought and provides new candidates among T3SS structural proteins and effectors for future functional investigations.","382":null,"383":"Klebsiella pneumoniae (Kp) reference strain Kp52.145 is widely used in experimental Klebsiella pathophysiology. Since 1935, only one other strain of the same sublineage (sequence type ST66, capsular serotype K2) was isolated (AJ210, Australia). Here, we describe a community-acquired invasive infection caused by a ST66-K2 Kp strain in France. Four hypermucoviscous Kp isolates responsible for acute otitis media, meningitis, bacteraemia and bacteriuria, respectively, were obtained from a patient with a history of chronic alcoholism and diabetes mellitus, and infected with HIV. The isolates were characterized by phenotypic and genomic methods. The four genetically identical ST66-K2 isolates presented a full antimicrobial susceptibility profile, including to ampicillin, corresponding to a single strain (SB5881), which was more closely related to AJ210 (135 SNPs) than to Kp52.145 (388 SNPs). Colibactin and yersiniabactin gene clusters were present on the integrative and conjugative element ICEKp10 in the chromosome. The two plasmids from Kp52.145 were detected in SB5881. In addition to carrying genes for virulence factors RmpA, aerobactin and salmochelin, plasmid II has acquired in SB5881, the conjugation machinery gene cluster from plasmid I. We report the first case of community-acquired infection caused by a hypervirulent ST66-K2 Kp strain in Europe. This demonstrates the long-term persistence of the high-virulence and laboratory model ST66-K2 sublineage. The combination of a conjugative apparatus and major virulence genes on a single plasmid may contribute to the co-occurrence of hypervirulence and multidrug resistance in single Kp strains.","384":"The quantification of the total microbial content in metagenomic samples is critical for investigating the interplay between the microbiome and its host, as well as for assessing the accuracy and precision of the relative microbial composition which can be strongly biased in low microbial biomass samples. In the present study, we demonstrate that digital droplet PCR (ddPCR) can provide accurate quantification of the total copy number of the 16S rRNA gene, the gene usually exploited for assessing total bacterial abundance in metagenomic DNA samples. Notably, using DNA templates with different integrity levels, as measured by the DNA integrity number (DIN), we demonstrated that 16S rRNA copy number quantification is strongly affected by DNA quality and determined a precise correlation between quantification underestimation and DNA degradation levels. Therefore, we propose an input DNA mass correction, according to the observed DIN value, which could prevent inaccurate quantification of 16S copy number in degraded metagenomic DNAs. Our results highlight that a preliminary evaluation of the metagenomic DNA integrity should be considered before performing metagenomic analyses of different samples, both for the assessment of the reliability of observed differential abundances in different conditions and to obtain significant functional insights.","385":"Fungi have developed the ability to overcome extreme growth conditions and thrive in hostile environments. The model fungus Aspergillus nidulans tolerates, for example, ambient alkalinity up to pH 10 or molar concentrations of multiple cations. The ability to grow under alkaline pH or saline stress depends on the effective function of at least three regulatory pathways mediated by the zinc-finger transcription factor PacC, which mediates the ambient pH regulatory pathway, the calcineurin-dependent CrzA and the cation homeostasis responsive factor SltA. Using RNA sequencing, we determined the effect of external pH alkalinization or sodium stress on gene expression. The data show that each condition triggers transcriptional responses with a low degree of overlap. By sequencing the transcriptomes of the null mutant, the role of SltA in the above-mentioned homeostasis mechanisms was also studied. The results show that the transcriptional role of SltA is wider than initially expected and implies, for example, the positive control of the PacC-dependent ambient pH regulatory pathway. Overall, our data strongly suggest that the stress response pathways in fungi include some common but mostly exclusive constituents, and that there is a hierarchical relationship among the main regulators of stress response, with SltA controlling pacC expression, at least in A. nidulans.","386":"Pathogen genomic data are increasingly used to characterize global and local transmission patterns of important human pathogens and to inform public health interventions. Yet, there is no current consensus on how to measure genomic variation. To test the effect of the variant-identification approach on transmission inferences for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, we conducted an experiment in which five genomic epidemiology groups applied variant-identification pipelines to the same outbreak sequence data. We compared the variants identified by each group in addition to transmission and phylogenetic inferences made with each variant set. To measure the performance of commonly used variant-identification tools, we simulated an outbreak. We compared the performance of three mapping algorithms, five variant callers and two variant filters in recovering true outbreak variants. Finally, we investigated the effect of applying increasingly stringent filters on transmission inferences and phylogenies. We found that variant-calling approaches used by different groups do not recover consistent sets of variants, which can lead to conflicting transmission inferences. Further, performance in recovering true variation varied widely across approaches. While no single variant-identification approach outperforms others in both recovering true genome-wide and outbreak-level variation, variant-identification algorithms calibrated upon real sequence data or that incorporate local reassembly outperform others in recovering true pairwise differences between isolates. The choice of variant filters contributed to extensive differences across pipelines, and applying increasingly stringent filters rapidly eroded the accuracy of transmission inferences and quality of phylogenies reconstructed from outbreak variation. Commonly used approaches to identify M. tuberculosis genomic variation have variable performance, particularly when predicting potential transmission links from pairwise genetic distances. Phylogenetic reconstruction may be improved by less stringent variant filtering. Approaches that improve variant identification in repetitive, hypervariable regions, such as long-read assemblies, may improve transmission inference.","387":null,"388":null,"389":"Metagenomics and marker gene approaches, coupled with high-throughput sequencing technologies, have revolutionized the field of microbial ecology. Metagenomics is a culture-independent method that allows the identification and characterization of organisms from all kinds of samples. Whole-genome shotgun sequencing analyses the total DNA of a chosen sample to determine the presence of micro-organisms from all domains of life and their genomic content. Importantly, the whole-genome shotgun sequencing approach reveals the genomic diversity present, but can also give insights into the functional potential of the micro-organisms identified. The marker gene approach is based on the sequencing of a specific gene region. It allows one to describe the microbial composition based on the taxonomic groups present in the sample. It is frequently used to analyse the biodiversity of microbial ecosystems. Despite its importance, the analysis of metagenomic sequencing and marker gene data is quite a challenge. Here we review the primary workflows and software used for both approaches and discuss the current challenges in the field.","390":"Nontypeable Haemophilus influenzae (NTHi) colonizes human upper respiratory airways and plays a key role in the course and pathogenesis of acute exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). Currently, it is not possible to distinguish COPD isolates of NTHi from other clinical isolates of NTHi using conventional genotyping methods. Here, we analysed the core and accessory genome of 568 NTHi isolates, including 40 newly sequenced isolates, to look for genetic distinctions between NTHi isolates from COPD with respect to other illnesses, including otitis media, meningitis and pneumonia. Phylogenies based on polymorphic sites in the core-genome did not show discrimination between NTHi strains collected from different clinical phenotypes. However, pan-genome-wide association studies identified 79 unique NTHi accessory genes that were significantly associated with COPD. Furthermore, many of the COPD-related NTHi genes have known or predicted roles in virulence, transmembrane transport of metal ions and nutrients, cellular respiration and maintenance of redox homeostasis. This indicates that specific genes may be required by NTHi for its survival or virulence in the COPD lung. These results advance our understanding of the pathogenesis of NTHi infection in COPD lungs.","391":"Food-associated outbreaks linked to enteropathogenic Yersinia enterocolitica are of concern to public health. Pigs and their meat are recognized risk factors for transmission of Y. enterocolitica. This study aimed to describe the comparative genomics of Y. enterocolitica along with a number of misclassified Yersinia isolates, now constituting the recently described Yersinia hibernica. The latter was originally cultured from an environmental sample taken at a pig slaughterhouse. Unique features were identified in the genome of Y. hibernica, including a novel integrative conjugative element (ICE), denoted as ICEYh-1 contained within a 255 kbp region of plasticity. In addition, a zebrafish embryo infection model was adapted and applied to assess the virulence potential among Yersinia isolates including Y. hibernica.","392":"Several members of the Gram-negative environmental bacterial genus Achromobacter are associated with serious infections, with Achromobacter xylosoxidans being the most common. Despite their pathogenic potential, little is understood about these intrinsically drug-resistant bacteria and their role in disease, leading to suboptimal diagnosis and management. Here, we performed comparative genomics for 158 Achromobacter spp. genomes to robustly identify species boundaries, reassign several incorrectly speciated taxa and identify genetic sequences specific for the genus Achromobacter and for A. xylosoxidans. Next, we developed a Black Hole Quencher probe-based duplex real-time PCR assay, Ac-Ax, for the rapid and simultaneous detection of Achromobacter spp. and A. xylosoxidans from both purified colonies and polymicrobial clinical specimens. Ac-Ax was tested on 119 isolates identified as Achromobacter spp. using phenotypic or genotypic methods. In comparison to these routine diagnostic methods, the duplex assay showed superior identification of Achromobacter spp. and A. xylosoxidans, with five Achromobacter isolates failing to amplify with Ac-Ax confirmed to be different genera according to 16S rRNA gene sequencing. Ac-Ax quantified both Achromobacter spp. and A. xylosoxidans down to ~110 genome equivalents and detected down to ~12 and ~1 genome equivalent(s), respectively. Extensive in silico analysis, and laboratory testing of 34 non-Achromobacter isolates and 38 adult cystic fibrosis sputa, confirmed duplex assay specificity and sensitivity. We demonstrate that the Ac-Ax duplex assay provides a robust, sensitive and cost-effective method for the simultaneous detection of all Achromobacter spp. and A. xylosoxidans and will facilitate the rapid and accurate diagnosis of this important group of pathogens.","393":null,"394":null,"395":"Diplomonad parasites of the genus Giardia have adapted to colonizing different hosts, most notably the intestinal tract of mammals. The human-pathogenic Giardia species, Giardia intestinalis, has been extensively studied at the genome and gene expression level, but no such information is available for other Giardia species. Comparative data would be particularly valuable for Giardia muris, which colonizes mice and is commonly used as a prototypic in vivo model for investigating host responses to intestinal parasitic infection. Here we report the draft-genome of G. muris. We discovered a highly streamlined genome, amongst the most densely encoded ever described for a nuclear eukaryotic genome. G. muris and G. intestinalis share many known or predicted virulence factors, including cysteine proteases and a large repertoire of cysteine-rich surface proteins involved in antigenic variation. Different to G. intestinalis, G. muris maintains tandem arrays of pseudogenized surface antigens at the telomeres, whereas intact surface antigens are present centrally in the chromosomes. The two classes of surface antigens engage in genetic exchange. Reconstruction of metabolic pathways from the G. muris genome suggest significant metabolic differences to G. intestinalis. Additionally, G. muris encodes proteins that might be used to modulate the prokaryotic microbiota. The responsible genes have been introduced in the Giardia genus via lateral gene transfer from prokaryotic sources. Our findings point to important evolutionary steps in the Giardia genus as it adapted to different hosts and it provides a powerful foundation for mechanistic exploration of host-pathogen interaction in the G. muris-mouse pathosystem.","396":null,"397":"Groundbreaking studies conducted in the mid-1980s demonstrated the possibility of sequencing ancient DNA (aDNA), which has allowed us to answer fundamental questions about the human past. Microbiologists were thus given a powerful tool to glimpse directly into inscrutable bacterial history, hitherto inaccessible due to a poor fossil record. Initially plagued by concerns regarding contamination, the field has grown alongside technical progress, with the advent of high-throughput sequencing being a breakthrough in sequence output and authentication. Albeit burdened with challenges unique to the analysis of bacteria, a growing number of viable sources for aDNA has opened multiple avenues of microbial research. Ancient pathogens have been extracted from bones, dental pulp, mummies and historical medical specimens and have answered focal historical questions such as identifying the aetiological agent of the black death as Yersinia pestis. Furthermore, ancient human microbiomes from fossilized faeces, mummies and dental plaque have shown shifts in human commensals through the Neolithic demographic transition and industrial revolution, whereas environmental isolates stemming from permafrost samples have revealed signs of ancient antimicrobial resistance. Culminating in an ever-growing repertoire of ancient genomes, the quickly expanding body of bacterial aDNA studies has also enabled comparisons of ancient genomes to their extant counterparts, illuminating the evolutionary history of bacteria. In this review we summarize the present avenues of research and contextualize them in the past of the field whilst also pointing towards questions still to be answered.","398":null,"399":"Salmonella is composed of a wide variety of serovars, causing human self-limited gastrointestinal illnesses or invasive infections. Invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella (iNTS) is well documented, with high mortality for children and immunocompromised adults in sub-Saharan Africa and has recently been reported in Southeast Asia. However, iNTS in China remains unknown. In May 2019, a case of invasive infection caused by Salmonella enterica serovar Uzaramo (S. Uzaramo) was reported for the first time in China. Phylogenomic analysis was performed by genomic sequencing the available contextualized isolates, which separated the two Chinese strains into different sublineages. Both phenotypic and genomic characterization demonstrated that the S. Uzaramo isolates showed in general low antimicrobial resistance potential, except one isolated from lake-water in China. Additional comparative genomic analysis and Caenorhabditis elegans killing assays suggested a unique combination of virulence factors, including typhoid toxin and tcf fimbrial adhesin, which might play a role in the invasive infection. This study highlights that the transparency of global surveillance genomic data could accelerate understanding of virulence and antimicrobial resistance makeup of a previously unknown threat.","400":"Roseburia species are important denizens of the human gut microbiome that ferment complex polysaccharides to butyrate as a terminal fermentation product, which influences human physiology and serves as an energy source for colonocytes. Previous comparative genomics analyses of the genus Roseburia have examined polysaccharide degradation genes. Here, we characterize the core and pangenomes of the genus Roseburia with respect to central carbon and energy metabolism, as well as biosynthesis of amino acids and B vitamins using orthology-based methods, uncovering significant differences among species in their biosynthetic capacities. Variation in gene content among Roseburia species and strains was most significant for cofactor biosynthesis. Unlike all other species of Roseburia that we analysed, Roseburia inulinivorans strains lacked biosynthetic genes for riboflavin or pantothenate but possessed folate biosynthesis genes. Differences in gene content for B vitamin synthesis were matched with differences in putative salvage and synthesis strategies among species. For example, we observed extended biotin salvage capabilities in R. intestinalis strains, which further suggest that B vitamin acquisition strategies may impact fitness in the gut ecosystem. As differences in the functional potential to synthesize components of biomass (e.g. amino acids, vitamins) can drive interspecies interactions, variation in auxotrophies of the Roseburia spp. genomes may influence in vivo gut ecology. This study serves to advance our understanding of the potential metabolic interactions that influence the ecology of Roseburia spp. and, ultimately, may provide a basis for rational strategies to manipulate the abundances of these species.","401":"Rearrangements of large genome fragments occur in bacteria between repeat sequences and can impact on growth and gene expression. Homologous recombination resulting in inversion between indirect repeats and excision\/translocation between direct repeats enables these structural changes. One form of rearrangement occurs around ribosomal operons, found in multiple copies across many bacteria, but identification of these rearrangements by sequencing requires reads of several thousand bases to span the ribosomal operons. With long-read sequencing aiding the routine generation of complete bacterial assemblies, we have developed socru, a typing method for the order and orientation of genome fragments between ribosomal operons. It allows for a single identifier to convey the order and orientation of genome-level structure and we have successfully applied this typing to 433 of the most common bacterial species. In a focused analysis, we observed the presence of multiple structural genotypes in nine bacterial pathogens, underscoring the importance of routinely assessing this form of variation alongside traditional single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) typing.","402":null,"403":null,"404":"Here, we report the draft genome sequence of Dissulfurirhabdus thermomarina SH388.

The tsetse endosymbiont Sodalis glossinidius displays intriguing metabolic adaptations to its microenvironment, but the process by which this relationship evolved remains to be elucidated. The recent chance discovery of the free-living species of the genus Sodalis, Sodalis praecaptivus, provides a serendipitous starting point from which to investigate the evolution of this symbiosis. Here, we present a flux balance model for S. praecaptivus and empirically verify its predictions. Metabolic modelling is used in combination with a multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to explore the trajectories that S. glossinidius may have undertaken from this starting point after becoming internalized. The order in which key genes are lost is shown to influence the evolved populations, providing possible targets for future in vitro genetic manipulation. This method provides a detailed perspective on possible evolutionary trajectories for S. glossinidius in this fundamental process of evolutionary and ecological change.","409":"Wildlife, and birds in particular, play an increasingly recognized role in the evolution and transmission of Escherichia coli that pose a threat to humans. To characterize these lineages and their potential threat from an evolutionary perspective, we isolated and performed whole-genome sequencing on 11 sequence types (STs) of E. coli recovered from the desiccated faeces of straw-necked ibis (Threskiornis spinicollis) nesting on inland wetlands located in geographically different regions of New South Wales, Australia. Carriage of virulence-associated genes was limited, and no antimicrobial resistance genes were detected, but novel variants of an insertion element that plays an important role in capturing and mobilizing antibiotic resistance genes, IS26, were identified and characterized. The isolates belonged to phylogroups B1 and D, including types known to cause disease in humans and animals. Specifically, we found E. coli ST58, ST69, ST162, ST212, ST446, ST906, ST2520, ST6096 and ST6241, and a novel phylogroup D strain, ST10208. Notably, the ST58 strain hosted significant virulence gene carriage. The sequences of two plasmids hosting putative virulence-associated factors with incompatibility groups I1 and Y, an extrachromosomal integrative\/conjugative element, and a variant of a large Escherichia phage of the family Myoviridae, were additionally characterized. We identified multiple epidemiologically relevant gene signatures that link the ibis isolates to sequences from international sources, plus novel variants of IS26 across different sequence types and in different contexts.","410":null,"411":"Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are agents of bacterial evolution and adaptation. Genome sequencing provides an unbiased approach that has revealed an abundance of MGEs in prokaryotes, mainly plasmids and integrative conjugative elements. Nevertheless, many mobilomes, particularly those from environmental bacteria, remain underexplored despite their representing a reservoir of genes that can later emerge in the clinic. Here, we explored the mobilome of the Mycobacteriaceae family, focusing on strains from Brazilian Atlantic Forest soil. Novel Mycolicibacterium and Mycobacteroides strains were identified, with the former ones harbouring linear and circular plasmids encoding the specialized type-VII secretion system (T7SS) and mobility-associated genes. In addition, we also identified a T4SS-mediated integrative conjugative element (ICEMyc226) encoding two T7SSs and a number of xenobiotic degrading genes. Our study uncovers the diversity of the Mycobacteriaceae mobilome, providing the evidence of an ICE in this bacterial family. Moreover, the presence of T7SS genes in an ICE, as well as plasmids, highlights the role of these mobile genetic elements in the dispersion of T7SS.","412":null,"413":null,"414":null,"415":null,"416":null,"417":"The Arctic is warming - fast. Microbes in the Arctic play pivotal roles in feedbacks that magnify the impacts of Arctic change. Understanding the genome evolution, diversity and dynamics of Arctic microbes can provide insights relevant for both fundamental microbiology and interdisciplinary Arctic science. Within this synthesis, we highlight four key areas where genomic insights to the microbial dimensions of Arctic change are urgently required: the changing Arctic Ocean, greenhouse gas release from the thawing permafrost, 'biological darkening' of glacial surfaces, and human activities within the Arctic. Furthermore, we identify four principal challenges that provide opportunities for timely innovation in Arctic microbial genomics. These range from insufficient genomic data to develop unifying concepts or model organisms for Arctic microbiology to challenges in gaining authentic insights to the structure and function of low-biomass microbiota and integration of data on the causes and consequences of microbial feedbacks across scales. We contend that our insights to date on the genomics of Arctic microbes are limited in these key areas, and we identify priorities and new ways of working to help ensure microbial genomics is in the vanguard of the scientific response to the Arctic crisis.","418":null,"419":null,"420":null,"421":null,"422":"Mobile genetic elements (MGEs) are key factors responsible for dissemination of virulence determinants and antimicrobial-resistance genes amongst pathogenic bacteria. Conjugative MGEs are notable for their high gene loads donated per transfer event, broad host ranges and phylogenetic ubiquity amongst prokaryotes, with the subclass of chromosomally inserted integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs) being particularly abundant. The focus on a small number of model systems has biased the study of ICEs towards those conferring readily selectable phenotypes to host cells, whereas the identification and characterization of integrated cryptic elements remains challenging. Even though antimicrobial resistance and horizontally acquired virulence genes are major factors aggravating neisserial infection, conjugative MGEs of Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis remain poorly characterized. Using a phenotype-independent approach based on atypical distributions of DNA uptake sequences (DUSs) in MGEs relative to the chromosomal background, we have identified two groups of chromosomally integrated conjugative elements in Neisseria: one found almost exclusively in pathogenic species possibly deriving from the genus Kingella, the other belonging to a group of Neisseria mucosa-like commensals. The former element appears to enable transfer of traditionally gonococcal-specific loci such as the virulence-associated toxin-antitoxin system fitAB to N. meningitidis chromosomes, whilst the circular form of the latter possesses a unique attachment site (attP) sequence seemingly adapted to exploit DUS motifs as chromosomal integration sites. In addition to validating the use of DUS distributions in Neisseriaceae MGE identification, the &gt;170 identified ICE sequences provide a valuable resource for future studies of ICE evolution and host adaptation.","423":null,"424":null,"425":null,"426":"While variant identification pipelines are becoming increasingly standardized, less attention has been paid to the pre-processing of variants prior to their use in bacterial genome-wide association studies (bGWAS). Three nuances of variant pre-processing that impact downstream identification of genetic associations include the separation of variants at multiallelic sites, separation of variants in overlapping genes, and referencing of variants relative to ancestral alleles. Here we demonstrate the importance of these variant pre-processing steps on diverse bacterial genomic datasets and present prewas, an R package, that standardizes the pre-processing of multiallelic sites, overlapping genes, and reference alleles before bGWAS. This package facilitates improved reproducibility and interpretability of bGWAS results. prewas enables users to extract maximal information from bGWAS by implementing multi-line representation for multiallelic sites and variants in overlapping genes. prewas outputs a binary SNP matrix that can be used for SNP-based bGWAS and will prevent the masking of minor alleles during bGWAS analysis.

WAY2 (WAY2) consists of a circular chromosome, three linear replicons and a small circular plasmid. The linear replicons contain typical actinobacterial invertron-type telomeres with the central CGTXCGC motif. Comparative phylogenetic analysis of the 16S rRNA gene along with phylogenomic analysis based on the genome-to-genome blast distance phylogeny (GBDP) algorithm and digital DNA-DNA hybridization (dDDH) with other Rhodococcus type strains resulted in a clear differentiation of WAY2, which is likely a new species. The genome of WAY2 contains five distinct clusters of bph, etb and nah genes, putatively involved in the degradation of several aromatic compounds. These clusters are distributed throughout the linear plasmids. The high sequence homology of the ring-hydroxylating subunits of these systems with other known enzymes has allowed us to model the range of aromatic substrates they could degrade. Further functional characterization revealed that WAY2 was able to grow with biphenyl, naphthalene and xylene as sole carbon and energy sources, and could oxidize multiple aromatic compounds, including ethylbenzene, phenanthrene, dibenzofuran and toluene. In addition, WAY2 was able to co-metabolize 23 polychlorinated biphenyl congeners, consistent with the five different ring-hydroxylating systems encoded by its genome. WAY2 could also use n-alkanes of various chain-lengths as a sole carbon source, probably due to the presence of alkB and ladA gene copies, which are only found in its chromosome. These results show that WAY2 has a potential to be used for the biodegradation of multiple organic compounds.","431":null,"432":"Klebsiella pneumoniae has emerged as an important nosocomial pathogen, with whole-genome sequencing (WGS) significantly improving our ability to characterize associated outbreaks. Our study sought to perform a genome-wide analysis of multiclonal K. pneumoniae isolates (n=39; 23 patients) producing extended spectrum beta-lactamases and\/or carbapenemases sourced between 2011 and 2016 in a Portuguese tertiary-care hospital. All isolates showed resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and six isolates (five patients) were also carbapenem resistant. Genome-wide-based phylogenetic analysis revealed a topology representing ongoing dissemination of three main sequence-type (ST) clades (ST15, ST147 and ST307) and transmission across different wards, compatible with missing links that can take the form of undetected colonized patients. Two carbapenemase-coding genes were detected: blaKPC-3, located on a Tn4401d transposon, and blaGES-5 on a novel class 3 integron. Additionally, four genes coding for ESBLs (blaBEL-1, blaCTX-M-8, blaCTX-M-15 and blaCTX-M-32) were also detected. ESBL horizontal dissemination across five clades is highlighted by the similar genetic environments of blaCTX-M-15 gene upstream of ISEcp1 on a Tn3-like transposon. Overall, this study provides a high-resolution genome-wide perspective on the epidemiology of ESBL and carbapenemase-producing K. pneumoniae in a healthcare setting while contributing for the adoption of appropriate intervention and prevention strategies.","433":null,"434":null,"435":"The availability of next-generation sequencing techniques provides an unprecedented opportunity for the assignment of gene function. Streptococcus equi subspecies equi is the causative agent of strangles in horses, one of the most prevalent and important diseases of equids worldwide.

Here, we employ transposon-directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS) to identify genes that are required for the fitness of S. equi in whole equine blood or in the presence of H2O2 to model selective pressures exerted by the equine immune response during infection. We report the fitness values of 1503 and 1471 genes, representing 94.5 and 92.5 % of non-essential genes in S. equi, following incubation in whole blood and in the presence of H2O2, respectively. Of these genes, 36 and 15 were identified as being important to the fitness of S. equi in whole blood or H2O2, respectively, with 14 genes being important in both conditions. Allelic replacement mutants were generated to validate the fitness results. Our data identify genes that are important for S. equi to resist aspects of the immune response in vitro, which can be exploited for the development of safer live attenuated vaccines to prevent strangles.","436":null,"437":null,"438":"Haemophilus influenzae causes common and sometimes severe adult and pediatric disease including chronic obstructive respiratory disease, otitis media and infections of the central nervous system. Serotype b strains, with a b-type capsule, have been the historical cause of invasive disease, and the introduction of a serotype b-specific vaccine has led to their decline. However, unencapsulated or non-b-type H. influenzae infections are not prevented by the vaccine and appear to be increasing in frequency. Here we report two pediatric cases of severe central nervous system H. influenzae infection presenting to the same hospital in San Diego, California during the same week in January 2016. Due to good vaccine coverage in this part of the world, H. influenzae cases are normally rare and seeing two cases in the same week was unexpected. We thus suspected a recent transmission chain, and possible local outbreak. To test this hypothesis, we isolated and sequenced whole genomes from each patient and placed them in a phylogenetic tree spanning the known diversity of H. influenzae. Surprisingly, we found that the two isolates (SD2016_1 and SD2016_2) belonged to distantly related lineages, suggesting two independent transmission events and ruling out a local outbreak. Despite being distantly related, the two isolates belong to two different lineages that have exchanged capsule loci in the recent past. Therefore, as in other bacterial pathogens, capsule switching by horizontal gene transfer may be an important evolutionary mechanism of vaccine evasion in H. influenzae.","439":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) is now widely used in microbiology to explore genome evolution and the structure of pathogen outbreaks. Bioinformatics pipelines readily detect single-nucleotide polymorphisms or short indels. However, bacterial genomes also evolve through the action of small transposable elements called insertion sequences (ISs), which are difficult to detect due to their short length and multiple repetitions throughout the genome. We designed panISa software for the ab initio detection of IS insertions in the genomes of prokaryotes. PanISa has been released as open source software (GPL3) available from https:\/\/github.com\/bvalot\/panISa. In this study, we assessed the utility of this software for evolutionary studies, by reanalysing five published datasets for outbreaks of human major pathogens in which ISs had not been specifically investigated. We reanalysed the raw data from each study, by aligning the reads against reference genomes and running panISa on the alignments. Each hit was automatically curated and IS-related events were validated on the basis of nucleotide sequence similarity, by comparison with the ISFinder database. In Acinetobacter baumannii, the panISa pipeline identified ISAba1 or ISAba125 upstream from the ampC gene, which encodes a cephalosporinase in all third-generation cephalosporin-resistant isolates. In the genomes of Vibrio cholerae isolates, we found that early Haitian isolates had the same ISs as Nepalese isolates, confirming the inferred history of the contamination of this island. In Enterococcus faecalis, panISa identified regions of high plasticity, including a pathogenicity island enriched in IS-related events. The overall distribution of ISs deduced with panISa was consistent with SNP-based phylogenic trees, for all species considered. The role of ISs in pathogen evolution has probably been underestimated due to difficulties detecting these transposable elements. We show here that panISa is a useful addition to the bioinformatics toolbox for analyses of the evolution of bacterial genomes. PanISa will facilitate explorations of the functional impact of ISs and improve our understanding of prokaryote evolution.","440":null,"441":"Clostridium difficile B1\/NAP1\/RT027\/ST01 has been responsible for outbreaks of antibiotic-associated diarrhoea in clinical settings worldwide and is associated with severe disease presentations and increased mortality rates. Two fluoroquinolone-resistant (FQR) lineages of the epidemic B1\/NAP1\/RT027\/ST01 strain emerged in the USA in the early 1990s and disseminated trans continentally (FQR1 and FQR2). However, it is unclear when and from where they entered Latin America (LA) and whether isolates from LA exhibit unique genomic features when compared to B1\/NAP1\/RT027\/ST01 isolates from other regions of the world. To answer the first issue we compared whole-genome sequences (WGS) of 25 clinical isolates typed as NAP1, RT027 or ST01 in Costa Rica (n=16), Chile (n=5), Honduras (n=3) and Mexico (n=1) to WGS of 129 global isolates from the same genotype using Bayesian phylogenomics. The second question was addressed through a detailed analysis of the number and type of mutations of the LA isolates and their mobile resistome. All but two B1\/NAP1\/RT027\/ST01 isolates from LA belong to the FQR2 lineage (n=23, 92 %), confirming its widespread distribution. As indicated by analysis of a dataset composed of 154 WGS, the B1\/NAP1\/RT027\/ST01 strain was introduced into the four LA countries analysed between 1998 and 2005 from North America (twice) and Europe (at least four times). These events occurred soon after the emergence of the FQR lineages and more than one decade before the first report of the detection of the B1\/NAP1\/RT027\/ST01 in LA. A total of 552 SNPs were identified across all genomes examined (3.8-4.3 Mb) in pairwise comparisons to the R20291 reference genome. Moreover, pairwise SNP distances were among the smallest distances determined in this species so far (0 to 55). Despite this high level of genomic conservation, 39 unique SNPs (7 %) in genes that play roles in the infection process (i.e. slpA) or antibiotic resistance (i.e. rpoB, fusA) distinguished the LA isolates. In addition, isolates from Chile, Honduras and Mexico had twice as many antibiotic resistance genes (ARGs, n=4) than related isolates from other regions. Their unique set of ARGs includes a cfr-like gene and tetM, which were found as part of putative mobile genetic elements whose sequences resemble undescribed integrative and conjugative elements. These results show multiple, independent introductions of B1\/NAP1\/RT027\/ST01 isolates from the FQR1 and FQR2 lineages from different geographical sources into LA and a rather rapid accumulation of distinct mutations and acquired ARG by the LA isolates.","442":"Rhizobia supply legumes with fixed nitrogen using a set of symbiosis genes. These can cross rhizobium species boundaries, but it is unclear how many other genes show similar mobility. Here, we investigate inter-species introgression using de novo assembly of 196 Rhizobium leguminosarum sv. trifolii genomes. The 196 strains constituted a five-species complex, and we calculated introgression scores based on gene-tree traversal to identify 171 genes that frequently cross species boundaries. Rather than relying on the gene order of a single reference strain, we clustered the introgressing genes into four blocks based on population structure-corrected linkage disequilibrium patterns. The two largest blocks comprised 125 genes and included the symbiosis genes, a smaller block contained 43 mainly chromosomal genes, and the last block consisted of three genes with variable genomic location. All introgression events were likely mediated by conjugation, but only the genes in the symbiosis linkage blocks displayed overrepresentation of distinct, high-frequency haplotypes. The three genes in the last block were core genes essential for symbiosis that had, in some cases, been mobilized on symbiosis plasmids. Inter-species introgression is thus not limited to symbiosis genes and plasmids, but other cases are infrequent and show distinct selection signatures.","443":null,"444":null,"445":null,"446":"In this work we compared the most frequently used Klebsiella pneumoniae typing methods: PFGE, cgMLST and coreSNP.

We compared the results of the different methods to the results of epidemiological investigation. Our results showed that cgMLST and coreSNP are more discriminant than PFGE, and that both approaches are suitable for transmission analyses. cgMLST appeared to be inferior to coreSNP in the K. pneumoniae CG258 phylogenetic reconstruction. Indeed, we found that the phylogenetic reconstruction based on cgMLST genes wrongly clustered ST258 clade1 and clade2 strains, conversely properly assigned by coreSNP approach. In conclusion, this study provides evidences supporting the reliability of both cgMLST and coreSNP for hospital surveillance programs and highlights the limits of cgMLST scheme genes for phylogenetic reconstructions.","447":null,"448":"Dengue virus (DENV) represents a public health threat and economic burden in affected countries.

Using DEN-IM, we successfully analysed two types of DENV datasets. The first comprised 25 shotgun metagenomic sequencing samples from patients with variable serotypes and genotypes, including an in vitro spiked sample containing the four known serotypes. The second consisted of 106 paired-end and 76 single-end amplicon sequences of DENV 3 genotype III and DENV 1 genotype I, respectively, where DEN-IM allowed detection of the intra-genotype diversity.

Additionally, we consider the methods used to detect clarithromycin resistance, emphasizing the use of high-throughput next-generation sequencing methods, which were applied to 17 newly sequenced pairs of H. pylori strains isolated from the antrum and corpus of a recent colonized paediatric population. This set of isolates was composed of six pairs of resistant strains whose phenotype was associated with two point mutations found in the 23S rRNA gene: A2142C and A2143G. Other point mutations were found simultaneously in the same gene, but, according to our results, it is unlikely that they contribute to resistance. Further, among susceptible isolates, genomic variations compatible with mutations previously associated with clarithromycin resistance were detected.

The first P. larvae phages were isolated in the 1950s, but as P. larvae was not antibiotic resistant at the time, interest in them remained scant. Interest in P. larvae phages has grown rapidly since the first P. larvae phage genome was sequenced in 2013. Since then, the number of sequenced P. larvae phage genomes has reached 48 and is set to grow further. All sequenced P. larvae phages encode a conserved N-acetylmuramoyl-l-alanine amidase that is responsible for cleaving the peptidoglycan cell wall of P. larvae. All P. larvae phages also encode either an integrase, excisionase or Cro\/CI, indicating that they are temperate. In the last few years, several studies have been published on using P. larvae phages and the P. larvae phage amidase as treatments for AFB. Studies were conducted on infected larvae in vitro and also on hives in the field. The phages have a prophylactic effect, preventing infection, and also a curative effect, helping resolve infection. P. larvae phages have a narrow range, lysing only P. larvae, and are unable to lyse even related Paenibacillus species.

The objective of our study was to compare the output of six of these different typing workflows (distance matrices of either SNP-based or allele-based workflows) in terms of cluster detection and concordance. To this end, we analysed a set of 180 isolates coming from confirmed and probable outbreak cases, which were representative of the genetic variation within the outbreak, supplemented with 22 unrelated contemporaneous S. enterica serovar Enteritidis isolates. Since the definition of a cluster cut-off based on genetic distance requires prior knowledge on the evolutionary processes that govern the bacterial populations in question, we used a variety of hierarchical clustering methods (single, average and complete) and selected the optimal number of clusters based on the consensus of the silhouette, Dunn2, and McClain-Rao internal validation indices. External validation was done by calculating the concordance with the WGS-based case definition (SNP-address) for this outbreak using the Fowlkes-Mallows index. Our analysis indicates that with complete-linkage hierarchical clustering combined with the optimal number of clusters, as defined by three internal validity indices, the six different allele- and SNP-based typing workflows generate clusters with similar compositions. Furthermore, we show that even in the absence of coordinated typing procedures, but by using an unsupervised machine learning methodology for cluster delineation, the various workflows that are currently in use by six European public-health authorities can identify concordant clusters of genetically related S. enterica serovar Enteritidis isolates; thus, providing public-health researchers with comparable tools for detection of infectious-disease outbreaks.","457":null,"458":null,"459":"Vibrio cholerae is a human pathogen, which is transmitted by the consumption of contaminated food or water.

Here we investigated the virulence determinants and phylogenetic origin of a non-O1\/non-O139 V. cholerae strain that caused a gastroenteritis outbreak in Santiago, Chile, 2018. We found that this outbreak strain lacks the classical virulence genes harboured by O1 and O139 strains, including the cholera toxin (CT) and the toxin-coregulated pilus (TCP). However, this strain carries genomic islands (GIs) encoding Type III and Type VI secretion systems (T3SS\/T6SS) and antibiotic resistance genes. Moreover, we found these GIs are wide distributed among several lineages of non-O1\/non-O139 strains. Our results suggest that the acquisition of these GIs may enhance the virulence of non-O1\/non-O139 strains that lack the CT and TCP-encoding genes. Our results highlight the pathogenic potential of these V. cholerae strains.","460":"The accessory genes of prokaryote and eukaryote pangenomes accumulate by horizontal gene transfer, differential gene loss, and the effects of selection and drift. We have developed Coinfinder, a software program that assesses whether sets of homologous genes (gene families) in pangenomes associate or dissociate with each other (i.e. are 'coincident') more often than would be expected by chance. Coinfinder employs a user-supplied phylogenetic tree in order to assess the lineage-dependence (i.e. the phylogenetic distribution) of each accessory gene, allowing Coinfinder to focus on coincident gene pairs whose joint presence is not simply because they happened to appear in the same clade, but rather that they tend to appear together more often than expected across the phylogeny. Coinfinder is implemented in C++, Python3 and R and is freely available under the GNU license from https:\/\/github.com\/fwhelan\/coinfinder.","461":null,"462":"Interspecific hybridization has played an important role in the evolution of eukaryotic organisms by favouring genetic interchange between divergent lineages to generate new phenotypic diversity involved in the adaptation to new environments. This way, hybridization between Saccharomyces species, involving the fusion between their metabolic capabilities, is a recurrent adaptive strategy in industrial environments. In the present study, whole-genome sequences of natural hybrids between Saccharomyces cerevisiae and Saccharomyces kudriavzevii were obtained to unveil the mechanisms involved in the origin and evolution of hybrids, as well as the ecological and geographic contexts in which spontaneous hybridization and hybrid persistence take place. Although Saccharomyces species can mate using different mechanisms, we concluded that rare-mating is the most commonly used, but other mechanisms were also observed in specific hybrids. The preponderance of rare-mating was confirmed by performing artificial hybridization experiments. The mechanism used to mate determines the genomic structure of the hybrid and its final evolutionary outcome. The evolution and adaptability of the hybrids are triggered by genomic instability, resulting in a wide diversity of genomic rearrangements. Some of these rearrangements could be adaptive under the stressful conditions of the industrial environment.","463":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) poses a threat to public health. Clinical microbiology laboratories typically rely on culturing bacteria for antimicrobial-susceptibility testing (AST). As the implementation costs and technical barriers fall, whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has emerged as a 'one-stop' test for epidemiological and predictive AST results. Few published comparisons exist for the myriad analytical pipelines used for predicting AMR. To address this, we performed an inter-laboratory study providing sets of participating researchers with identical short-read WGS data from clinical isolates, allowing us to assess the reproducibility of the bioinformatic prediction of AMR between participants, and identify problem cases and factors that lead to discordant results. We produced ten WGS datasets of varying quality from cultured carbapenem-resistant organisms obtained from clinical samples sequenced on either an Illumina NextSeq or HiSeq instrument. Nine participating teams ('participants') were provided these sequence data without any other contextual information. Each participant used their choice of pipeline to determine the species, the presence of resistance-associated genes, and to predict susceptibility or resistance to amikacin, gentamicin, ciprofloxacin and cefotaxime. We found participants predicted different numbers of AMR-associated genes and different gene variants from the same clinical samples. The quality of the sequence data, choice of bioinformatic pipeline and interpretation of the results all contributed to discordance between participants. Although much of the inaccurate gene variant annotation did not affect genotypic resistance predictions, we observed low specificity when compared to phenotypic AST results, but this improved in samples with higher read depths. Had the results been used to predict AST and guide treatment, a different antibiotic would have been recommended for each isolate by at least one participant. These challenges, at the final analytical stage of using WGS to predict AMR, suggest the need for refinements when using this technology in clinical settings. Comprehensive public resistance sequence databases, full recommendations on sequence data quality and standardization in the comparisons between genotype and resistance phenotypes will all play a fundamental role in the successful implementation of AST prediction using WGS in clinical microbiology laboratories.","464":"Prophages are integrated phage elements that are a pervasive feature of bacterial genomes. The fitness of bacteria is enhanced by prophages that confer beneficial functions such as virulence, stress tolerance or phage resistance, and these functions are encoded by 'accessory' or 'moron' loci. Whilst the majority of phage-encoded genes are repressed during lysogeny, accessory loci are often highly expressed. However, it is challenging to identify novel prophage accessory loci from DNA sequence data alone. Here, we use bacterial RNA-seq data to examine the transcriptional landscapes of five Salmonella prophages. We show that transcriptomic data can be used to heuristically enrich for prophage features that are highly expressed within bacterial cells and represent functionally important accessory loci. Using this approach, we identify a novel antisense RNA species in prophage BTP1, STnc6030, which mediates superinfection exclusion of phage BTP1. Bacterial transcriptomic datasets are a powerful tool to explore the molecular biology of temperate phages.","465":"Proteins interacting with DNA are fundamental for mediating processes such as gene expression, DNA replication and maintenance of genome integrity. Accumulating evidence suggests that the chromatin of apicomplexan parasites, such as Plasmodium falciparum, is highly organized, and this structure provides an epigenetic mechanism for transcriptional regulation. To investigate how parasite chromatin structure is being regulated, we undertook comparative genomics analysis using 12 distinct eukaryotic genomes. We identified conserved and parasite-specific chromatin-associated domains (CADs) and proteins (CAPs). We then used the chromatin enrichment for proteomics (ChEP) approach to experimentally capture CAPs in P. falciparum. A topological scoring analysis of the proteomics dataset revealed stage-specific enrichments of CADs and CAPs. Finally, we characterized, two candidate CAPs: a conserved homologue of the structural maintenance of chromosome 3 protein and a homologue of the crowded-like nuclei protein, a plant-like protein functionally analogous to animal nuclear lamina proteins. Collectively, our results provide a comprehensive overview of CAPs in apicomplexans, and contribute to our understanding of the complex molecular components regulating chromatin structure and genome architecture in these deadly parasites.","466":"To establish the prevalence of mobile colistin resistance (mcr) genes amongst Salmonella enterica isolates obtained through public health surveillance in England (April 2014 to September 2017), 33 205 S. enterica genome sequences obtained from human, food, animal and environmental isolates were screened for the presence of mcr variants 1 to 8. The mcr-positive genomes were assembled, annotated and characterized according to plasmid type. Nanopore sequencing was performed on six selected isolates with putative novel plasmids, and phylogenetic analysis was used to provide an evolutionary context for the most commonly isolated clones. Fifty-two mcr-positive isolates were identified, of which 32 were positive for mcr-1, 19 for mcr-3 and 1 for mcr-5. The combination of Illumina and Nanopore sequencing identified three novel mcr-3 plasmids and one novel mcr-5 plasmid, as well as the presence of chromosomally integrated mcr-1 and mcr-3. Monophasic S. enterica serovar Typhimurium accounted for 27\/52 (52 %) of the mcr-positive isolates, with the majority clustering in clades associated with travel to Southeast Asia. Isolates in these clades were associated with a specific plasmid range and an additional extended-spectrum beta-lactamase genotype. Routine whole-genome sequencing for public health surveillance provides an effective screen for novel and emerging antimicrobial determinants, including mcr. Complementary long-read technologies elucidated the genomic context of resistance determinants, offering insights into plasmid dissemination and linkage to other resistance genes.","467":null,"468":"Human-to-human transmission of the melioidosis bacterium, Burkholderia pseudomallei, is exceedingly rare, with only a handful of suspected cases documented to date. Here, we used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize one such unusual B. pseudomallei transmission event, which occurred between a breastfeeding mother with mastitis and her child. Two strains corresponding to multilocus sequence types (STs)-259 and -261 were identified in the mother's sputum from both the primary culture sweep and in purified colonies, confirming an unusual polyclonal infection in this patient. In contrast, primary culture sweeps of the mother's breast milk and the child's cerebrospinal fluid and blood samples contained only ST-259, indicating monoclonal transmission to the child. Analysis of purified ST-259 isolates showed no genetic variation between mother and baby isolates, providing the strongest possible evidence of B. pseudomallei human-to-human transmission, probably via breastfeeding. Next, phylogenomic analysis of all isolates, including the mother's mixed ST-259\/ST-261 sputum sample, was performed to investigate the effects of mixtures on phylogenetic inference. Inclusion of this mixture caused a dramatic reduction in the number of informative SNPs, resulting in branch collapse of ST-259 and ST-261 isolates, and several instances of incorrect topology in a global B. pseudomallei phylogeny, resulting in phylogenetic incongruence. Although phylogenomics can provide clues about the presence of mixtures within WGS datasets, our results demonstrate that this methodology can lead to phylogenetic misinterpretation if mixed genomes are not correctly identified and omitted. Using current bioinformatic tools, we demonstrate a robust method for bacterial mixture identification and strain parsing that avoids these pitfalls.","469":"Phages and plasmids play important roles in bacterial evolution and diversification. Although many draft genomes have been generated, phage and plasmid genomes are usually fragmented, limiting our understanding of their dynamics. Here, we performed a systematic analysis of 239 draft genomes and 7 complete genomes of Shiga toxin (Stx)-producing Escherichia coli O145:H28, the major virulence factors of which are encoded by prophages (PPs) or plasmids. The results indicated that PPs are more stably maintained than plasmids. A set of ancestrally acquired PPs was well conserved, while various PPs, including Stx phages, were acquired by multiple sublineages. In contrast, gains and losses of a wide range of plasmids have frequently occurred across the O145:H28 lineage, and only the virulence plasmid was well conserved. The different dynamics of PPs and plasmids have differentially impacted the pangenome of O145:H28, with high proportions of PP- and plasmid-associated genes in the variably present and rare gene fractions, respectively. The dynamics of PPs and plasmids have also strongly impacted virulence gene repertoires, such as the highly variable distribution of stx genes and the high conservation of a set of type III secretion effectors, which probably represents the core effectors of O145:H28 and the genes on the virulence plasmid in the entire O145:H28 population. These results provide detailed insights into the dynamics of PPs and plasmids, and show the application of genomic analyses using a large set of draft genomes and appropriately selected complete genomes.","470":"Tuberculosis (TB) surveillance is scarce in most African countries, even though it is the continent with the greatest disease incidence according to the World Health Organization. Liberia is within the 30 countries with the highest TB burden, probably as a consequence of the long civil war and the recent Ebola outbreak, both crippling the health system and depreciating the TB prevention and control programmes. Due to difficulties working in the country, there is a lack of resistance surveys and bacillus characterization. Here, we use genome sequencing of Mycobacterium tuberculosis clinical isolates to fill this gap. Our results highlight that the bacillus population structure is dominated by lineage 4 strains that harbour an outstanding genetic diversity, higher than in the rest of Africa as a whole. Coalescent analyses demonstrate that strains currently circulating in Liberia were introduced several times beginning in the early year 600 CE until very recently coinciding with migratory movements associated with the civil war and Ebola epidemics. A higher multidrug-resistant (MDR)-TB frequency (23.5 %) than current estimates was obtained together with non-catalogued drug-resistance mutations. Additionally, 39 % of strains were in genomic clusters revealing that ongoing transmission is a major contribution to the TB burden in the country. Our report emphasizes the importance of TB surveillance and control in African countries where bacillus diversity, MDR-TB prevalence and transmission are coalescing to jeopardize TB control programmes.","471":null,"472":"Resistance to meticillin and vancomycin in Staphylococcus aureus significantly complicates the management of severe infections like bacteraemia, endocarditis or osteomyelitis. Here, we review the molecular mechanisms and genomic epidemiology of resistance to these agents, with a focus on how genomics has provided insights into the emergence and evolution of major meticillin-resistant S. aureus clones. We also provide insights on the use of bacterial whole-genome sequencing to inform management of S. aureus infections and for control of transmission at the hospital and in the community.","473":"Cryptococcus neoformans is an opportunistic fungal pathogen that at its peak epidemic levels caused an estimated million cases of cryptococcal meningitis per year worldwide. This species can grow in diverse environmental (trees, soil and bird excreta) and host niches (intracellular microenvironments of phagocytes and free-living in host tissues). The genetic basic for adaptation to these different conditions is not well characterized, as most experimental work has relied on a single reference strain of C. neoformans. To identify genes important for yeast infection and disease progression, we profiled the gene expression of seven C. neoformans isolates grown in five representative in vitro environmental and in vivo conditions. We characterized gene expression differences using RNA-Seq (RNA sequencing), comparing clinical and environmental isolates from two of the major lineages of this species, VNI and VNBI. These comparisons highlighted genes showing lineage-specific expression that are enriched in subtelomeric regions and in lineage-specific gene clusters. By contrast, we find few expression differences between clinical and environmental isolates from the same lineage. Gene expression specific to in vivo stages reflects available nutrients and stresses, with an increase in fungal metabolism within macrophages, and an induction of ribosomal and heat-shock gene expression within the subarachnoid space. This study provides the widest view to date of the transcriptome variation of C. neoformans across natural isolates, and provides insights into genes important for in vitro and in vivo growth stages.","474":null,"475":"The heterogeneous and highly recombinogenic genus Haemophilus comprises several species, some of which are pathogenic to humans. All share an absolute requirement for blood-derived factors during growth. Certain species, such as the pathogen Haemophilus influenzae and the commensal Haemophilus haemolyticus, are thought to require both haemin (X-factor) and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD, V-factor), whereas others, such as the informally classified 'Haemophilus intermedius subsp. intermedius', and Haemophilus parainfluenzae, only require V-factor. These differing growth requirements are commonly used for species differentiation, although a number of studies are now revealing issues with this approach. Here, we perform large-scale phylogenomics of 240 Haemophilus spp. genomes, including five 'H. intermedius' genomes generated in the current study, to reveal that strains of the 'H. intermedius' group are in fact haemin-independent H. haemolyticus (hiHh). Closer examination of these hiHh strains revealed that they encode an intact haemin biosynthesis pathway, unlike haemin-dependent H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae, which lack most haemin biosynthesis genes. Our results suggest that the common ancestor of modern-day H. haemolyticus and H. influenzae lost key haemin biosynthesis loci, likely as a consequence of specialized adaptation to otorhinolaryngeal and respiratory niches during their divergence from H. parainfluenzae. Genetic similarity analysis demonstrated that the haemin biosynthesis loci acquired in the hiHh lineage were likely laterally transferred from a H. parainfluenzae ancestor, and that this event probably occurred only once in hiHh. This study further challenges the validity of phenotypic methods for differentiating among Haemophilus species, and highlights the need for whole-genome sequencing for accurate characterization of species within this taxonomically challenging genus.","476":null,"477":null,"478":"With the ever-expanding number of available sequences from bacterial genomes, and the expectation that this data type will be the primary one generated from both diagnostic and research laboratories for the foreseeable future, then there is both an opportunity and a need to evaluate how effectively computational approaches can be used within bacterial genomics to predict and understand complex phenotypes, such as pathogenic potential and host source. This article applied various quantitative methods such as diversity indexes, pangenome-wide association studies (GWAS) and dimensionality reduction techniques to better understand the data and then compared how well unsupervised and supervised machine learning (ML) methods could predict the source host of the isolates. The study uses the example of the pangenomes of 1203 Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates in order to predict 'host of isolation' using these different methods. The article is aimed as a review of recent applications of ML in infection biology, but also, by working through this specific dataset, it allows discussion of the advantages and drawbacks of the different techniques. As with all such sub-population studies, the biological relevance will be dependent on the quality and diversity of the input data. Given this major caveat, we show that supervised ML has the potential to add real value to interpretation of bacterial genomic data, as it can provide probabilistic outcomes for important phenotypes, something that is very difficult to achieve with the other methods.","479":null,"480":null,"481":"Escherichia albertii is a recently recognized human enteropathogen that is closely related to Escherichia coli. In many Gram-negative bacteria, including E. coli, O-antigen variation has long been used for the serotyping of strains. In E. albertii, while eight O-serotypes unique to this species have been identified, some strains have been shown to exhibit genetic or serological similarity to known E. coli\/Shigella O-serotypes. However, the diversity of O-serotypes and O-antigen biosynthesis gene clusters (O-AGCs) of E. albertii remains to be systematically investigated. Here, we analysed the O-AGCs of 65 E. albertii strains and identified 40 E. albertii O-genotypes (EAOgs) (named EAOg1-EAOg40). Analyses of the 40 EAOgs revealed that as many as 20 EAOgs exhibited significant genetic and serological similarity to the O-AGCs of known E. coli\/Shigella O-serotypes, and provided evidence for the inter-species horizontal gene transfer of O-AGCs between E. albertii and E. coli. Based on the sequence variation in the wzx gene among the 40 EAOgs, we developed a multiplex PCR-based O-genotyping system for E. albertii (EAO-genotyping PCR) and verified its usefulness by genotyping 278 E. albertii strains from various sources. Although 225 (80.9 %) of the 278 strains could be genotyped, 51 were not assigned to any of the 40 EAOgs, indicating that further analyses are required to better understand the diversity of O-AGCs in E. albertii and improve the EAO-genotyping PCR method. A phylogenetic view of E. albertii strains sequenced so far is also presented with the distribution of the 40 EAOgs, which provided multiple examples for the intra-species horizontal transfer of O-AGCs in E. albertii.","482":"Bacteroides fragilis constitutes a significant part of the normal human gut microbiota and can also act as an opportunistic pathogen. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) and the prevalence of AMR genes are increasing, and prediction of antimicrobial susceptibility based on sequence information could support targeted antimicrobial therapy in a clinical setting. Complete identification of insertion sequence (IS) elements carrying promoter sequences upstream of resistance genes is necessary for prediction of AMR. However, de novo assemblies from short reads alone are often fractured due to repeat regions and the presence of multiple copies of identical IS elements. Identification of plasmids in clinical isolates can aid in the surveillance of the dissemination of AMR, and comprehensive sequence databases support microbiome and metagenomic studies. We tested several short-read, hybrid and long-lead assembly pipelines by assembling the type strain B. fragilis CCUG4856T (=ATCC25285=NCTC9343) with Illumina short reads and long reads generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) MinION sequencing. Hybrid assembly with Unicycler, using quality filtered Illumina reads and Filtlong filtered and Canu-corrected ONT reads, produced the assembly of highest quality. This approach was then applied to six clinical multidrug-resistant B. fragilis isolates and, with minimal manual finishing of chromosomal assemblies of three isolates, complete, circular assemblies of all isolates were produced. Eleven circular, putative plasmids were identified in the six assemblies, of which only three corresponded to a known cultured Bacteroides plasmid. Complete IS elements could be identified upstream of AMR genes; however, there was not complete correlation between the absence of IS elements and antimicrobial susceptibility. As our knowledge on factors that increase expression of resistance genes in the absence of IS elements is limited, further research is needed prior to implementing AMR prediction for B. fragilis from whole-genome sequencing.","483":"Chlamydia trachomatis is the most prevalent sexually transmitted bacterium worldwide and the causative agent of trachoma. Its strains are classified according to their ompA genotypes, which are strongly linked to differential tissue tropism and disease outcomes [ocular disease, urogenital disease and lymphogranuloma venereum (LGV)]. While the genome-based species phylogenetic tree presents four main clades correlating with tropism\/prevalence, namely ocular, LGV, urogenital T1 (more prevalent genotypes) and urogenital T2 (less prevalent genotypes), inter-clade exchange of ompA is considered a rare phenomenon probably mediating marked tropism alterations. An LGV epidemic, associated with the clonal expansion of the L2b genotype, has emerged in the last few decades, raising concerns particularly due to its atypical clinical presentation (ulcerative proctitis) and circulation among men who have sex with men (MSM). Here, we report an LGV outbreak, mostly affecting human immunodeficiency virus-positive MSM engaging in high-risk sexual practices, caused by an L2b strain with a rather unique non-LGV ompA signature that precluded the laboratory notification of this outbreak as LGV. C. trachomatis whole-genome capture and sequencing directly from clinical samples was applied to deeply characterize the genomic backbone of this novel LGV outbreak-causing clone. It revealed a chimeric genome structure due to the genetic transfer of ompA and four neighbouring genes from a serovar D\/Da strain, likely possessing the genomic backbone associated with the more prevalent urogenital genotypes (T1 clade), to an LGV (L2b) strain. The hybrid L2b\/D-Da strain presents the adhesin and immunodominant antigen MOMP (major outer membrane protein) (encoded by ompA) with an epitope repertoire typical of non-invasive genital strains, while keeping the genome-dispersed virulence fingerprint of a classical LGV strain. As previously reported for inter-clade ompA exchange among non-LGV clades, this novel C. trachomatis genomic mosaic involving a contemporary epidemiologically and clinically relevant LGV strain may have implications on its transmission, tissue tropism and pathogenic capabilities. The emergence of variants with epidemic and pathogenic potential highlights the need for more focused surveillance strategies to capture C. trachomatis evolution in action.","484":null,"485":null,"486":"Here, we report comprehensive transcriptomic profiles from Fusobacterium nucleatum under conditions that mimic the first stages of bacterial infection in a highly differentiated adenocarcinoma epithelial cell line. Our transcriptomic in vitro adenocarcinoma approach allows us to measure the expression dynamics and regulation of bacterial virulence and response factors in real time, and is a novel strategy for clarifying the role of F. nucleatum infection in colorectal cancer (CRC) progression. Our data show that: (i) infection alters metabolic and functional pathways in F. nucleatum, allowing the bacterium to adapt to the host-imposed milieu; (ii) infection also stimulates the expression of genes required to help induce and promote a hypoxic and inflammatory microenvironment in the host; and (iii) F. nucleatum invasion occurs by a haematogenous route of infection. Our study identifies novel gene targets from F. nucleatum that are activated during invasion and which may aid in determining how this species invades and promotes disease within the human gastrointestinal tract. These invasion-specific genes may be useful as biomarkers for CRC progression in a host and could also assist in the development of new diagnostic tools and treatments (such as vaccines or small molecule drug targets), which will be able to combat infection and inflammation in the host while circumventing the potential problem of F. nucleatum tolerization.","487":"Acinetobacter baumannii is an opportunistic bacterium that causes hospital-acquired infections with a high mortality and morbidity, since there are strains resistant to virtually any kind of antibiotic. The chase to find novel strategies to fight against this microbe can be favoured by knowledge of the complete catalogue of genes of the species, and their relationship with the specific characteristics of different isolates. In this work, we performed a genomics analysis of almost 2500 strains. Two different groups of genomes were found based on the number of shared genes. One of these groups rarely has plasmids, and bears clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR) sequences, in addition to CRISPR-associated genes (cas genes) or restriction-modification system genes. This fact strongly supports the lack of plasmids. Furthermore, the scarce plasmids in this group also bear CRISPR sequences, and specifically contain genes involved in prokaryotic toxin-antitoxin systems that could either act as the still little known CRISPR type IV system or be the precursors of other novel CRISPR\/Cas systems. In addition, a limited set of strains present a new cas9-like gene, which may complement the other cas genes in inhibiting the entrance of new plasmids into the bacteria. Finally, this group has exclusive genes involved in biofilm formation, which would connect CRISPR systems to the biogenesis of these bacterial resistance structures.","488":null,"489":null,"490":null,"491":null,"492":"Vibrio parahaemolyticus is an important cause of foodborne gastroenteritis globally. Thermostable direct haemolysin (TDH) and the TDH-related haemolysin are the two key virulence factors in V. parahaemolyticus. Vibrio pathogenicity islands harbour the genes encoding these two haemolysins. The serotyping of V. parahaemolyticus is based on the combination of O and K antigens. Frequent recombination has been observed in V. parahaemolyticus, including in the genomic regions encoding the O and K antigens. V. parahaemolyticus serotype O4:K12 has caused gastroenteritis outbreaks in the USA and Spain. Recently, outbreaks caused by this serotype of V. parahaemolyticus have been reported in China. However, the relationships among this serotype of V. parahaemolyticus strains isolated in different regions have not been addressed. Here, we investigated the genome variation of the V. parahaemolyticus serotype O4:K12 using the whole-genome sequences of 29 isolates. We determined five distinct lineages in this strain collection. We observed frequent recombination among different lineages. In contrast, little recombination was observed within each individual lineage. We showed that the lineage of this serotype of V. parahaemolyticus isolated in America was different from those isolated in Asia and identified genes that exclusively existed in the strains isolated in America. Pan-genome analysis showed that strain-specific and cluster-specific genes were mostly located in the genomic islands. Pan-genome analysis also showed that the vast majority of the accessory genes in the O4:K12 serotype of V. parahaemolyticus were acquired from within the genus Vibrio. Hence, we have shown that multiple distinct lineages exist in V. parahaemolyticus serotype O4:K12 and have provided more evidence about the gene segregation found in V. parahaemolyticus isolated in different continents.","493":"The genus Yersinia comprises species that differ widely in their pathogenic potential and public-health significance. Yersinia pestis is responsible for plague, while Yersinia enterocolitica is a prominent enteropathogen. Strains within some species, including Y. enterocolitica, also vary in their pathogenic properties. Phenotypic identification of Yersinia species is time-consuming, labour-intensive and may lead to incorrect identifications. Here, we developed a method to automatically identify and subtype all Yersinia isolates from their genomic sequence. A phylogenetic analysis of Yersinia isolates based on a core subset of 500 shared genes clearly demarcated all existing Yersinia species and uncovered novel, yet undefined Yersinia taxa. An automated taxonomic assignment procedure was developed using species-specific thresholds based on core-genome multilocus sequence typing (cgMLST). The performance of this method was assessed on 1843 isolates prospectively collected by the French National Surveillance System and analysed in parallel using phenotypic reference methods, leading to nearly complete (1814; 98.4 %) agreement at species and infra-specific (biotype and serotype) levels. For 29 isolates, incorrect phenotypic assignments resulted from atypical biochemical characteristics or lack of phenotypic resolution. To provide an identification tool, a database of cgMLST profiles and reference taxonomic information has been made publicly accessible (https:\/\/bigsdb.pasteur.fr\/yersinia). Genomic sequencing-based identification and subtyping of any Yersinia is a powerful and reliable novel approach to define the pathogenic potential of isolates of this medically important genus.","494":"Yersinia pseudotuberculosis is a Gram-negative bacterium capable of causing gastrointestinal infection and is closely related to the highly virulent plague bacillus Yersinia pestis. Infections by both species are currently treatable with antibiotics such as ciprofloxacin, a quinolone-class drug of major clinical importance in the treatment of many other infections. Our current understanding of the mechanism of action of ciprofloxacin is that it inhibits DNA replication by targeting DNA gyrase, and that resistance is primarily due to mutation of this target site, along with generic efflux and detoxification strategies. We utilized transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS or TnSeq) to identify the non-essential chromosomal genes in Y. pseudotuberculosis that are required to tolerate sub-lethal concentrations of ciprofloxacin in vitro. As well as highlighting recognized antibiotic resistance genes, we provide evidence that multiple genes involved in regulating DNA replication and repair are central in enabling Y. pseudotuberculosis to tolerate the antibiotic, including DksA (yptb0734), a regulator of RNA polymerase, and Hda (yptb2792), an inhibitor of DNA replication initiation. We furthermore demonstrate that even at sub-lethal concentrations, ciprofloxacin causes severe cell-wall stress, requiring lipopolysaccharide lipid A, O-antigen and core biosynthesis genes to resist the sub-lethal effects of the antibiotic. It is evident that coping with the consequence(s) of antibiotic-induced stress requires the contribution of scores of genes that are not exclusively engaged in drug resistance.","495":"The Acinetobacter baumannii global clone 1 isolate AB307-0294, recovered in the USA in 1994, and the global clone 2 (GC2) isolate ACICU, isolated in 2005 in Italy, were among the first A. baumannii isolates to be completely sequenced. AB307-0294 is susceptible to most antibiotics and has been used in many genetic studies, and ACICU belongs to a rare GC2 lineage. The complete genome sequences, originally determined using 454 pyrosequencing technology, which is known to generate sequencing errors, were re-determined using Illumina MiSeq and MinION (Oxford Nanopore Technologies) technologies and a hybrid assembly generated using Unicycler. Comparison of the resulting new high-quality genomes to the earlier 454-sequenced versions identified a large number of nucleotide differences affecting protein coding sequence (CDS) features, and allowed the sequences of the long and highly repetitive bap and blp1 genes to be properly resolved for the first time in ACICU. Comparisons of the annotations of the original and revised genomes revealed a large number of differences in the protein CDS features, underlining the impact of sequence errors on protein sequence predictions and core gene determination. On average, 400 predicted CDSs were longer or shorter in the revised genomes and about 200 CDS features were no longer present.","496":"Clostridium perfringens is a major enteric pathogen known to cause gastroenteritis in human adults. Although major outbreak cases are frequently reported, only limited whole-genome sequencing (WGS) based studies have been performed to understand the genomic epidemiology and virulence gene content of outbreak-associated C. perfringens strains. We performed phylogenomic analysis on 109 C. perfringens isolates (human and food) obtained from disease cases in England and Wales between 2011 and 2017. Initial findings highlighted the enhanced discriminatory power of WGS in profiling outbreak C. perfringens strains, when compared to the current Public Health England referencing laboratory technique of fluorescent amplified fragment length polymorphism analysis. Further analysis identified that isogenic C. perfringens strains were associated with nine distinct care-home-associated outbreaks over the course of a 5-year interval, indicating a potential common source linked to these outbreaks or transmission over time and space. As expected, the enterotoxin cpe gene was encoded in all but 4 isolates (96.3 %; 105\/109), with virulence plasmids encoding cpe (particularly pCPF5603 and pCPF4969 plasmids) extensively distributed (82.6 %; 90\/109). Genes encoding accessory virulence factors, such as beta-2 toxin, were commonly detected (46.7 %; 51\/109), and genes encoding phage proteins were also frequently identified. Overall, this large-scale genomic study of gastroenteritis-associated C. perfringens suggested that three major cpe-encoding (toxinotype F) genotypes underlie these outbreaks: strains carrying (1) pCPF5603 plasmid, (2) pCPF4969 plasmid and (3) chromosomal-cpe strains. Our findings substantially expanded our knowledge on type F C. perfringens involved in human-associated gastroenteritis, with further studies required to fully probe the dissemination and regional reservoirs of this enteric pathogen, which may help devise effective prevention strategies to reduce the food-poisoning disease burden in vulnerable patients, such as the elderly.","497":"Respiratory syncytial viruses (RSVs) are an important cause of mortality worldwide and a major cause of respiratory tract infections in children, driving development of vaccine candidates. However, there are large gaps in our knowledge of the local evolutionary and transmission dynamics of RSVs, particularly in understudied regions such as the Middle East. To address this gap, we sequenced the complete genomes of 58 RSVA and 27 RSVB samples collected in a paediatric cohort in Amman, Jordan, between 2010 and 2013. RSVA and RSVB co-circulated during each winter epidemic of RSV in Amman, and each epidemic comprised multiple independent viral introductions of RSVA and RSVB. However, RSVA and RSVB alternated in dominance across years, potential evidence of immunological interactions. Children infected with RSVA tended to be older than RSVB-infected children [30 months versus 22.4 months, respectively (P value = 0.02)], and tended to developed bronchopneumonia less frequently than those with RSVB, although the difference was not statistically significant (P value = 0.06). Differences in spatial patterns were investigated, and RSVA lineages were often identified in multiple regions in Amman, whereas RSVB introductions did not spread beyond a single region of the city, although these findings were based on small sample sizes. Multiple RSVA genotypes were identified in Amman, including GA2 viruses as well as three viruses from the ON1 sub-genotype that emerged in 2009 and are now the dominant genotype circulating worldwide. As vaccine development advances, further sequencing of RSV is needed to understand viral ecology and transmission, particularly in under-studied locations.","498":"The interplay between food production animals, humans and the environment with respect to the transmission of drug-resistant pathogens is widely debated and poorly understood. Pandemic uropathogenic Escherichia coli ST131-H30Rx, with conserved fluoroquinolone and cephalosporin resistance, are not frequently identified in animals. However, the phylogenetic precursor lineage ST131-H22 in animals and associated meat products is being reported with increasing frequency. Here we characterized two highly related ST131-H22 strains, one from a healthy pig and the other from a human infection (in 2007 and 2009, respectively). We used both long and short genome sequencing and compared them to ST131-H22 genome sequences available in public repositories. Even within the context of H22 strains, the two strains in question were highly related, separated by only 20 core SNPs. Furthermore, they were closely related to a faecal strain isolated in 2010 from a geographically distinct, healthy human in New South Wales, Australia. The porcine and hospital strains carried highly similar HI2-ST3 multidrug resistant plasmids with differences in the hospital strain arising due to IS-mediated insertions and rearrangements. Near identical ColV plasmids were also present in both strains, further supporting their shared evolutionary history. This work highlights the importance of adopting a One Health approach to genomic surveillance to gain insights into pathogen evolution and spread.","499":null,"500":"Among long-stay critically ill patients in the adult intensive care unit (ICU), there are often marked changes in the complexity of the gut microbiota. However, it remains unclear whether such patients might benefit from enhanced surveillance or from interventions targeting the gut microbiota or the pathogens therein. We therefore undertook a prospective observational study of 24 ICU patients, in which serial faecal samples were subjected to shotgun metagenomic sequencing, phylogenetic profiling and microbial genome analyses. Two-thirds of the patients experienced a marked drop in gut microbial diversity (to an inverse Simpson's index of &lt;4) at some stage during their stay in the ICU, often accompanied by the absence or loss of potentially beneficial bacteria. Intravenous administration of the broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent meropenem was significantly associated with loss of gut microbial diversity, but the administration of other antibiotics, including piperacillin\/tazobactam, failed to trigger statistically detectable changes in microbial diversity. In three-quarters of ICU patients, we documented episodes of gut domination by pathogenic strains, with evidence of cryptic nosocomial transmission of Enterococcus faecium. In some patients, we also saw an increase in the relative abundance of apparent commensal organisms in the gut microbiome, including the archaeal species Methanobrevibacter smithii. In conclusion, we have documented a dramatic absence of microbial diversity and pathogen domination of the gut microbiota in a high proportion of critically ill patients using shotgun metagenomics.","501":null,"502":null,"503":"Malaria was present in most of Europe until the second half of the 20th century, when it was eradicated through a combination of increased surveillance and mosquito control strategies, together with cross-border and political collaboration. Despite the severe burden of malaria on human populations, it remains contentious how the disease arrived and spread in Europe. Here, we report a partial Plasmodium falciparum nuclear genome derived from a set of antique medical slides stained with the blood of malaria-infected patients from Spain's Ebro Delta, dating to the 1940s. Our analyses of the genome of this now eradicated European P. falciparum strain confirms stronger phylogeographical affinity to present-day strains in circulation in central south Asia, rather than to those in Africa. This points to a longitudinal, rather than a latitudinal, spread of malaria into Europe. In addition, this genome displays two derived alleles in the pfmrp1 gene that have been associated with drug resistance. Whilst this could represent standing variation in the ancestral P. falciparum population, these mutations may also have arisen due to the selective pressure of quinine treatment, which was an anti-malarial drug already in use by the time the sample we sequenced was mounted on a slide.","504":null,"505":null,"506":null,"507":"The genus Lactobacillus is known to be extremely diverse and consists of different phylogenetic groups that show a diversity that is roughly equal to the expected diversity of a typical bacterial genus. One of the most prominent phylogenetic groups within this genus is the Lactobacillus plantarum group, which contains the understudied Lactobacillus mudanjiangensis species. Before this study, only one L. mudanjiangensis strain, DSM 28402T, had been described, but without whole-genome analysis. In this study, three strains classified as L. mudanjiangensis were isolated from three different carrot juice fermentations and their whole-genome sequence was determined, together with the genome sequence of the type strain. The genomes of all four strains were compared with publicly available L. plantarum group genome sequences. This analysis showed that L. mudanjiangensis harboured the second largest genome size and gene count of the whole L. plantarum group. In addition, all members of this species showed the presence of a gene coding for a cellulose-degrading enzyme. Finally, three of the four L. mudanjiangensis strains studied showed the presence of pili on scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images, which were linked to conjugative gene regions, coded on a plasmid in at least two of the strains studied.","508":"","509":"Bacteria and archaea make up most of natural diversity, but the mechanisms that underlie the origin and maintenance of prokaryotic species are poorly understood. We investigated the speciation history of the genus Salmonella, an ecologically diverse bacterial lineage, within which S. enterica subsp. enterica is responsible for important human food-borne infections. We performed a survey of diversity across a large reference collection using multilocus sequence typing, followed by genome sequencing of distinct lineages. We identified 11 distinct phylogroups, 3 of which were previously undescribed. Strains assigned to S. enterica subsp. salamae are polyphyletic, with two distinct lineages that we designate Salamae A and B. Strains of the subspecies houtenae are subdivided into two groups, Houtenae A and B, and are both related to Selander's group VII. A phylogroup we designate VIII was previously unknown. A simple binary fission model of speciation cannot explain observed patterns of sequence diversity. In the recent past, there have been large-scale hybridization events involving an unsampled ancestral lineage and three distantly related lineages of the genus that have given rise to Houtenae A, Houtenae B and VII. We found no evidence for ongoing hybridization in the other eight lineages, but detected subtler signals of ancient recombination events. We are unable to fully resolve the speciation history of the genus, which might have involved additional speciation-by-hybridization or multi-way speciation events. Our results imply that traditional models of speciation by binary fission and divergence are not sufficient to account for Salmonella evolution.","510":"Vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecium (VREfm) is a globally significant public health threat and was listed on the World Health Organization's 2017 list of high-priority pathogens for which new treatments are urgently needed.

Whole-genome sequencing is providing important new insights into VREfm evolution, drug resistance and hospital adaptation, and is increasingly being used to track VREfm transmission within hospitals to detect outbreaks and inform infection control practices. This mini-review provides an overview of recent data on the use of genomics to understand and respond to the global problem of VREfm.","511":"Bacteriophages are the most prevalent biological entities impacting on the ecosystem and are characterized by their extensive diversity. However, there are two aspects of phages that have remained largely unexplored: genetic flux by recombination between phage populations and characterization of specific phages in terms of the pan-genome. Here, we examined the recombination and pan-genome in Helicobacter pylori prophages at both the genome and gene level. In the genome-level analysis, we applied, for the first time, chromosome painting and fineSTRUCTURE algorithms to a phage species, and showed novel trends in inter-population genetic flux. Notably, hpEastAsia is a phage population that imported a higher proportion of DNA fragments from other phages, whereas the hpSWEurope phages showed weaker signatures of inter-population recombination, suggesting genetic isolation. The gene-level analysis showed that, after parameter tuning of the prokaryote pan-genome analysis program, H. pylori phages have a pan-genome consisting of 75 genes and a soft-core genome of 10 genes, which includes genes involved in the lytic and lysogenic life cycles. Quantitative analysis of recombination events of the soft-core genes showed no substantial variation in the intensity of recombination across the genes, but rather equally frequent recombination among housekeeping genes that were previously reported to be less prone to recombination. The signature of frequent recombination appears to reflect the host-phage evolutionary arms race, either by contributing to escape from bacterial immunity or by protecting the host by producing defective phages.","512":null,"513":null,"514":"","515":null,"516":null,"517":"Salmonellaenterica serovar Kentucky is an emergent human pathogen.

One of the best characterized T2SS is that of Legionella pneumophila, the agent of Legionnaires' disease. Secreting at least 25 proteins, including degradative enzymes, eukaryotic-like proteins and novel effectors, this T2SS contributes to the ability of L. pneumophila to grow at low temperatures, infect amoebal and macrophage hosts, damage lung tissue, evade the immune system, and undergo sliding motility. The genes encoding the T2SS are conserved across the genus Legionella, which includes 62 species and &gt;30 pathogens in addition to L. pneumophila. The vast majority of effectors associated with L. pneumophila are shared by a large number of Legionella species, hinting at a critical role for them in the ecology of Legionella as a whole. However, no other species has the same repertoire as L. pneumophila, with, as a general rule, phylogenetically more closely related species sharing similar sets of effectors. T2SS effectors that are involved in infection of a eukaryotic host(s) are more prevalent throughout Legionella, indicating that they are under stronger selective pressure. The Legionella T2SS apparatus is closest to that of Aquicella (another parasite of amoebae), and a significant number of L. pneumophila effectors have their closest homologues in Aquicella. Thus, the T2SS of L. pneumophila probably originated within the order Legionellales, with some of its effectors having arisen within that Aquicella-like progenitor, while other effectors derived from the amoebal host, mimiviruses, fungi and less closely related bacteria.","520":"Salmonella enterica serotype Kentucky can be a common causative agent of salmonellosis, usually associated with consumption of contaminated poultry. Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) to multiple drugs, including ciprofloxacin, is an emerging problem within this serotype. We used whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate the phylogenetic structure and AMR content of 121 S.enterica serotype Kentucky sequence type 198 isolates from five continents. Population structure was inferred using phylogenomic analysis and whole genomes were compared to investigate changes in gene content, with a focus on acquired AMR genes. Our analysis showed that multidrug-resistant (MDR) S.enterica serotype Kentucky isolates belonged to a single lineage, which we estimate emerged circa 1989 following the acquisition of the AMR-associated Salmonella genomic island (SGI) 1 (variant SGI1-K) conferring resistance to ampicillin, streptomycin, gentamicin, sulfamethoxazole and tetracycline. Phylogeographical analysis indicates this clone emerged in Egypt before disseminating into Northern, Southern and Western Africa, then to the Middle East, Asia and the European Union. The MDR clone has since accumulated various substitution mutations in the quinolone-resistance-determining regions (QRDRs) of DNA gyrase (gyrA) and DNA topoisomerase IV (parC), such that most strains carry three QRDR mutations which together confer resistance to ciprofloxacin. The majority of AMR genes in the S. enterica serotype Kentucky genomes were carried either on plasmids or SGI structures. Remarkably, each genome of the MDR clone carried a different SGI1-K derivative structure; this variation could be attributed to IS26-mediated insertions and deletions, which appear to have hampered previous attempts to trace the clone's evolution using sub-WGS resolution approaches. Several different AMR plasmids were also identified, encoding resistance to chloramphenicol, third-generation cephalosporins, carbapenems and\/or azithromycin. These results indicate that most MDR S. enterica serotype Kentucky circulating globally result from the clonal expansion of a single lineage that acquired chromosomal AMR genes 30 years ago, and has continued to diversify and accumulate additional resistances to last-line oral antimicrobials.

To date however, genomics-based studies of STEC have been predominately focused upon STEC collected in the Northern Hemisphere. Here, we demonstrate the population structure of 485 STEC isolates in Australia, and show that several clonal groups (CGs) common to Australia were infrequently detected in a representative selection of contemporary STEC genomes from around the globe. Further, phylogenetic analysis demonstrated that lineage II of the global O157:H7 STEC was most prevalent in Australia, and was characterized by a frameshift mutation in flgF, resulting in the H-non-motile phenotype. Strong concordance between in silico and phenotypic serotyping was observed, along with concordance between in silico and conventional detection of stx genes. These data represent the most comprehensive STEC analysis from the Southern Hemisphere, and provide a framework for future national genomics-based surveillance of STEC in Australia.","522":"Clostridioides difficile is a ubiquitous, diarrhoeagenic pathogen often associated with healthcare-acquired infections that can cause a range of symptoms from mild, self-limiting disease to toxic megacolon and death. Since the early 2000s, a large proportion of C. difficile cases have been attributed to the ribotype 027 (RT027) lineage, which is associated with sequence type 1 (ST1) in the C. difficile multilocus sequence typing scheme. The spread of ST1 has been attributed, in part, to resistance to fluoroquinolones used to treat unrelated infections, which creates conditions ideal for C. difficile colonization and proliferation. In this study, we analysed 27 isolates from a healthcare network in northern Arizona, USA, and 1352 publicly available ST1 genomes to place locally sampled isolates into a global context. Whole genome, single nucleotide polymorphism analysis demonstrated that at least six separate introductions of ST1 were observed in healthcare facilities in northern Arizona over an 18-month sampling period. A reconstruction of transmission networks identified potential nosocomial transmission of isolates, which were only identified via whole genome sequence analysis. Antibiotic resistance heterogeneity was observed among ST1 genomes, including variability in resistance profiles among locally sampled ST1 isolates. To investigate why ST1 genomes are so common globally and in northern Arizona, we compared all high-quality C. difficile genomes and identified that ST1 genomes have gained and lost a number of genomic regions compared to all other C. difficile genomes; analyses of other toxigenic C. difficile sequence types demonstrate that this loss may be anomalous and could be related to niche specialization. These results suggest that a combination of antimicrobial resistance and gain and loss of specific genes may explain the prominent association of this sequence type with C. difficile infection cases worldwide. The degree of genetic variability in ST1 suggests that classifying all ST1 genomes into a quinolone-resistant hypervirulent clone category may not be appropriate. Whole genome sequencing of clinical C. difficile isolates provides a high-resolution surveillance strategy for monitoring persistence and transmission of C. difficile and for assessing the performance of infection prevention and control strategies.","523":null,"524":"Bacteria are highly diverse, even within a species; thus, there have been many studies which classify a single species into multiple types and analyze the genetic differences between them. Recently, the use of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) has been popular for these analyses, and the identification of single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between isolates is the most basic analysis performed following WGS. The performance of SNP-calling methods therefore has a significant effect on the accuracy of downstream analyses, such as phylogenetic tree inference. In particular, when closely related isolates are analyzed, e.g. in outbreak investigations, some SNP callers tend to detect a high number of false-positive SNPs compared with the limited number of true SNPs among isolates. However, the performances of various SNP callers in such a situation have not been validated sufficiently. Here, we show the results of realistic benchmarks of commonly used SNP callers, revealing that some of them exhibit markedly low accuracy when target isolates are closely related. As an alternative, we developed a novel pipeline BactSNP, which utilizes both assembly and mapping information and is capable of highly accurate and sensitive SNP calling in a single step. BactSNP is also able to call SNPs among isolates when the reference genome is a draft one or even when the user does not input the reference genome.

Previous surveillance work in Pennsylvania documented increased antimicrobial resistance (AMR) in S. sonnei associated with reported illnesses. The present study examined a subset of these isolates by whole genome sequencing (WGS) to determine the relationship between domestic and international isolates, to identify genes that may be useful for identifying specific Global Lineages of S. sonnei and to test the accuracy of WGS for predicting AMR phenotype. A collection of 22 antimicrobial-resistant isolates from patients infected within the United States or while travelling internationally between 2009 and 2014 was chosen for WGS. Phylogenetic analysis revealed both international and domestic isolates were one of two previously defined Global Lineages of S. sonnei, designated Lineage II and Lineage III. Twelve of 17 alleles tested distinguish these two lineages. Lastly, genome analysis was used to identify AMR determinants. Genotypic analysis was concordant with phenotypic resistance for six of eight antibiotic classes. For aminoglycosides and trimethoprim, resistance genes were identified in two and three phenotypically sensitive isolates, respectively.

This study describes the minimum natural resistome of pig faeces as the bacteria are under no direct antibiotic selective pressure. The faecal resistome of 257 different genes comprised 56 core and 201 accessory resistance genes. The genes present at the highest relative abundances across all samples were tetW, tetQ, tet44, tet37, tet40, mefA, aadE, ant(9)-1, ermB and cfxA2. This study characterized the baseline resistome, the microbiome composition and the metabolic components described by the Kyoto Encyclopedia of Genes and Genomes (KEGG) pathways in healthy pig faeces, without antibiotic selective pressures. The microbiome hierarchical analysis resulted in a cluster tree with a highly similar pattern to that of the accessory resistome cluster tree. Functional capacity profiling identified genes associated with horizontal gene transfer. We identified a statistically significant positive correlation between the total antibiotic resistome and suggested indicator genes, which agree with using these genes as indicators of the total resistomes. The correlation between total resistome and total microbiome in this study was positive and statistically significant. Therefore, the microbiome composition influenced the resistome composition. This study identified a core and accessory resistome present in a cohort of healthy pigs, in the same conditions without antibiotics. It highlights the presence of antibiotic resistance in the absence of antibiotic selective pressure and the variability between animals even under the same housing, food and living conditions. Antibiotic resistance will remain in the healthy pig gut even when antibiotics are not used. Therefore, the risk of antibiotic resistance transfer from animal faeces to human pathogens or the environment will remain in the absence of antibiotics.","527":"The surveillance of antimicrobial-resistant isolates has proven to be one of the most valuable tools to understand the global rise of multidrug-resistant bacterial pathogens. We report the first insights into the current situation in the Caribbean, where a pilot project to monitor antimicrobial resistance (AMR) through phenotypic resistance measurements combined with whole-genome sequencing was set up in collaboration with the Caribbean Public Health Agency (CARPHA). Our first study focused on Klebsiella pneumoniae, a highly relevant organism amongst the Gram-negative opportunistic pathogens worldwide causing hospital- and community-acquired infections. Our results show that not only carbapenem resistance, but also hypervirulent strains, are circulating in patients in the Caribbean. Our current data does not allow us to infer their prevalence in the population. We argue for the urgent need to further support AMR surveillance and stewardship in this almost uncharted territory, which can make a significant impact on the reduction of antimicrobial usage.

NP genome-mining aims at extracting biosynthetic information from the genomes of microbes presumed to produce these compounds. Typically, canonical enzyme sequences from known biosynthetic systems are identified after sequence similarity searches. Despite this being an efficient process, the likelihood of identifying truly novel systems by this approach is low. To overcome this limitation, we previously introduced EvoMining, a genome-mining approach that incorporates evolutionary principles. Here, we release and use our latest EvoMining version, which includes novel visualization features and customizable databases, to analyse 42 central metabolic enzyme families (EFs) conserved throughout Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Pseudomonas and Archaea. We found that expansion-and-recruitment profiles of these 42 families are lineage specific, opening the metabolic space related to 'shell' enzymes. These enzymes, which have been overlooked, are EFs with orthologues present in most of the genomes of a taxonomic group, but not in all. As a case study of canonical shell enzymes, we characterized the expansion and recruitment of glutamate dehydrogenase and acetolactate synthase into scytonemin biosynthesis, and into other central metabolic pathways driving Archaea and Bacteria adaptive evolution. By defining the origin and fate of enzymes, EvoMining complements traditional genome-mining approaches as an unbiased strategy and opens the door to gaining insights into the evolution of NP biosynthesis. We anticipate that EvoMining will be broadly used for evolutionary studies, and for generating predictions of unprecedented chemical scaffolds and new antibiotics.

Phylogenetic analysis of genomic data can provide a powerful platform to identify lineages within bacterial populations, and thus inform outbreak investigation and transmission dynamics. However, resolving differences between pathogens associated with low-variant (LV) populations carrying low median pairwise single nucleotide variant (SNV) distances remains a major challenge. Here we present rPinecone, an R package designed to define sub-lineages within closely related LV populations. rPinecone uses a root-to-tip directional approach to define sub-lineages within a phylogenetic tree according to SNV distance from the ancestral node. The utility of this software was demonstrated using both simulated outbreaks and real genomic data of two LV populations: a hospital outbreak of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and endemic Salmonella Typhi from rural Cambodia. rPinecone identified the transmission branches of the hospital outbreak and geographically confined lineages in Cambodia. Sub-lineages identified by rPinecone in both analyses were phylogenetically robust. It is anticipated that rPinecone can be used to discriminate between lineages of bacteria from LV populations where other methods fail, enabling a deeper understanding of infectious disease epidemiology for public health purposes.","533":"Phenotypic change is a hallmark of bacterial adaptation during chronic infection. In the case of chronic Pseudomonas aeruginosa lung infection in patients with cystic fibrosis, well-characterized phenotypic variants include mucoid and small colony variants (SCVs). It has previously been shown that SCVs can be reproducibly isolated from the murine lung following the establishment of chronic infection with mucoid P. aeruginosa strain NH57388A. Using a combination of single-molecule real-time (PacBio) and Illumina sequencing we identify a large genomic inversion in the SCV through recombination between homologous regions of two rRNA operons and an associated truncation of one of the 16S rRNA genes and suggest this may be the genetic switch for conversion to the SCV phenotype. This phenotypic conversion is associated with large-scale transcriptional changes distributed throughout the genome. This global rewiring of the cellular transcriptomic output results in changes to normally differentially regulated genes that modulate resistance to oxidative stress, central metabolism and virulence. These changes are of clinical relevance because the appearance of SCVs during chronic infection is associated with declining lung function.","534":"The human gut microbiome plays an essential role in maintaining human health including in degradation of dietary fibres and carbohydrates further used as nutrients by both the host and the gut bacteria. Previously, we identified a polysaccharide utilization loci (PUL) involved in sucrose and raffinose family oligosaccharide (RFO) metabolism from one of the most common Firmicutes present in individuals, Ruminococcus gnavus E1. One of the enzymes encoded by this PUL was annotated as a putative sucrose phosphate phosphorylase (RgSPP). In the present study, we have in-depth characterized the heterologously expressed RgSPP as sucrose 6F-phosphate phosphorylase (SPP), expanding our knowledge of the glycoside hydrolase GH13_18 subfamily. Specifically, the enzymatic characterization showed a selective activity on sucrose 6F-phosphate (S6FP) acting both in phosphorolysis releasing alpha-d-glucose-1-phosphate (G1P) and alpha-d-fructose-6-phosphate (F6P), and in reverse phosphorolysis from G1P and F6P to S6FP. Interestingly, such a SPP activity had never been observed in gut bacteria before. In addition, a phylogenetic and synteny analysis showed a clustering and a strictly conserved PUL organization specific to gut bacteria. However, a wide prevalence and abundance study with a human metagenomic library showed a correlation between SPP activity and the geographical origin of the individuals and, thus, most likely linked to diet. Rgspp gene overexpression has been observed in mice fed with a high-fat diet suggesting, as observed for humans, that intestine lipid and carbohydrate microbial metabolisms are intertwined. Finally, based on the genomic environment analysis, in vitro and in vivo studies, results provide new insights into the gut microbiota catabolism of sucrose, RFOs and S6FP.","535":null,"536":"Sequence type (ST)73 has emerged as one of the most frequently isolated extraintestinal pathogenic Escherichia coli. To examine the localized diversity of ST73 clonal groups, including their mobile genetic element profile, we sequenced the genomes of 16 multiple-drug resistant ST73 isolates from patients with urinary tract infection from a single hospital in Sydney, Australia, between 2009 and 2011. Genome sequences were used to generate a SNP-based phylogenetic tree to determine the relationship of these isolates in a global context with ST73 sequences (n=210) from public databases. There was no evidence of a dominant outbreak strain of ST73 in patients from this hospital, rather we identified at least eight separate groups, several of which reoccurred, over a 2 year period. The inferred phylogeny of all ST73 strains (n=226) including the ST73 clone D i2 reference genome shows high bootstrap support and clusters into four major groups that correlate with serotype. The Sydney ST73 strains carry a wide variety of virulence-associated genes, but the presence of iss, pic and several iron-acquisition operons was notable.","537":null,"538":"Campylobacter jejuni is the most common cause of bacterial diarrheal disease in the world. Clinical outcomes of infection can range from asymptomatic infection to life-threatening extraintestinal infections. This variability in outcomes for infected patients has raised questions as to whether genetic differences between C. jejuni isolates contribute to their likelihood of causing severe disease. In this study, we compare the genomes of ten C. jejuni isolates that were implicated in extraintestinal infections with reference gastrointestinal isolates, in order to identify unusual patterns of sequence variation associated with infection outcome. We identified a collection of genes that display a higher burden of uncommon mutations in invasive isolates compared with gastrointestinal close relatives, including some that have been previously linked to virulence and invasiveness in C. jejuni. Among the top genes identified were mreB and pgp1, which are both involved in determining cell shape. Electron microscopy confirmed morphological differences in isolates carrying unusual sequence variants of these genes, indicating a possible relationship between extraintestinal infection and changes in cell morphology.","539":null,"540":"Two common classes of nitrogen-fixing legume root nodules are those that have determinate or indeterminate meristems, as in Phaseolus bean and pea, respectively. In indeterminate nodules, rhizobia terminally differentiate into bacteroids with endoreduplicated genomes, whereas bacteroids from determinate nodules are less differentiated and can regrow. We used RNA sequencing to compare bacteroid gene expression in determinate and indeterminate nodules using two Rhizobium leguminosarum strains whose genomes differ due to replacement of the symbiosis (Sym) plasmid pRP2 (strain Rlp4292) with pRL1 (strain RlvA34), thereby switching symbiosis hosts from Phaseolus bean (determinate nodules) to pea (indeterminate nodules). Both bacteroid types have gene expression patterns typical of a stringent response, a stressful environment and catabolism of dicarboxylates, formate, amino acids and quaternary amines. Gene expression patterns were indicative that bean bacteroids were more limited for phosphate, sulphate and iron than pea bacteroids. Bean bacteroids had higher levels of expression of genes whose products are predicted to be associated with metabolite detoxification or export. Pea bacteroids had increased expression of genes associated with DNA replication, membrane synthesis and the TCA (tricarboxylic acid) cycle. Analysis of bacteroid-specific transporter genes was indicative of distinct differences in sugars and other compounds in the two nodule environments. Cell division genes were down-regulated in pea but not bean bacteroids, while DNA synthesis was increased in pea bacteroids. This is consistent with endoreduplication of pea bacteroids and their failure to regrow once nodules senesce.","541":"We present the LiSEQ (Listeria SEQuencing) project, funded by the European Food Safety Agency (EFSA) to compare Listeria monocytogenes isolates collected in the European Union from ready-to-eat foods, compartments along the food chain (e.g. food-producing animals, food-processing environments) and humans. In this article, we report the molecular characterization of a selection of this data set employing whole-genome sequencing analysis. We present an overview of the strain diversity observed in different sampled sources, and characterize the isolates based on their virulence and resistance profile.

Colistin is a historic antimicrobial that has become commonly used as a treatment for MDR A. baumannii infections. The increase in colistin usage has been mirrored by an increase in colistin resistance. We aimed to identify the mechanisms associated with colistin resistance in A. baumannii using multiple high-throughput-sequencing technologies, including transposon-directed insertion site sequencing (TraDIS), RNA sequencing (RNAseq) and whole-genome sequencing (WGS) to investigate the genotypic changes of colistin resistance in A. baumannii. Using TraDIS, we found that genes involved in drug efflux (adeIJK), and phospholipid (mlaC, mlaF and mlaD) and lipooligosaccharide synthesis (lpxC and lpsO) were required for survival in sub-inhibitory concentrations of colistin. Transcriptomic (RNAseq) analysis revealed that expression of genes encoding efflux proteins (adeI, adeC, emrB, mexB and macAB) was enhanced in in vitro generated colistin-resistant strains. WGS of these organisms identified disruptions in genes involved in lipid A (lpxC) and phospholipid synthesis (mlaA), and in the baeS\/R two-component system (TCS). We additionally found that mutations in the pmrB TCS genes were the primary colistin-resistance-associated mechanisms in three Vietnamese clinical colistin-resistant A. baumannii strains. Our results outline the entire range of mechanisms employed in A. baumannii for resistance against colistin, including drug extrusion and the loss of lipid A moieties by gene disruption or modification.","543":null,"544":null,"545":"","546":"Gonorrhoea infections are on the increase and strains that are resistant to all antimicrobials used to treat the disease have been found worldwide.

Here we present HomoplasyFinder, a java application that can be used as a stand-a-lone tool or within the statistical programming environment R. Within R and Java, HomoplasyFinder is shown to be able to automatically, and quickly, identify any homoplasies present in simulated and real phylogenetic data. HomoplasyFinder can easily be incorporated into existing analysis pipelines, either within or outside of R, allowing the user to quickly identify homoplasies to inform downstream analyses and interpretation.","549":"The persuasiveness of genomic evidence has pressured scientific agencies to supplement or replace well-established methodologies to inform public health and food safety decision-making. This study of 52 epidemiologically defined Listeria monocytogenes isolates, collected between 1981 and 2011, including nine outbreaks, was undertaken (1) to characterize their phylogenetic relationship at finished genome-level resolution, (2) to elucidate the underlying genetic diversity within an endemic subtype, CC8, and (3) to re-evaluate the genetic relationship and epidemiology of a CC8-delimited outbreak in Canada in 2008. Genomes representing Canadian Listeria outbreaks between 1981 and 2010 were closed and manually annotated. Single nucleotide variants (SNVs) and horizontally acquired traits were used to generate phylogenomic models. Phylogenomic relationships were congruent with classical subtyping and epidemiology, except for CC8 outbreaks, wherein the distribution of SNV and prophages revealed multiple co-evolving lineages. Chronophyletic reconstruction of CC8 evolution indicates that prophage-related genetic changes among CC8 strains manifest as PFGE subtype reversions, obscuring the relationship between CC8 isolates, and complicating the public health interpretation of subtyping data, even at maximum genome resolution. The size of the shared genome interrogated did not change the genetic relationship measured between highly related isolates near the tips of the phylogenetic tree, illustrating the robustness of these approaches for routine public health applications where the focus is recent ancestry. The possibility exists for temporally and epidemiologically distinct events to appear related even at maximum genome resolution, highlighting the continued importance of epidemiological evidence.","550":"Resistance to carbapenem and aminoglycoside antibiotics is a critical problem in Acinetobacter baumannii, particularly when genes conferring resistance are acquired by multiply or extensively resistant members of successful globally distributed clonal complexes, such as global clone 1 (GC1) . Here, we investigate the evolution of an expanding clade of lineage 1 of the GC1 complex via repeated acquisition of carbapenem- and aminoglycoside-resistance genes. Lineage 1 arose in the late 1970s and the Tn6168\/OCL3 clade arose in the late 1990s from an ancestor that had already acquired resistance to third-generation cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones. Between 2000 and 2002, two distinct subclades have emerged, and they are distinguishable via the presence of an integrated phage genome in subclade 1 and AbaR4 (carrying the oxa23 carbapenem-resistance gene in Tn2006) at a specific chromosomal location in subclade 2. Part or all of the original resistance gene cluster in the chromosomally located AbaR3 has been lost from some isolates, but plasmids carrying alternate resistance genes have been gained. In one group in subclade 2, the chromosomally located AbGRI3, carrying the armA aminoglycoside-resistance gene, has been acquired from a GC2 isolate and incorporated via homologous recombination. ISAba1 entered the common ancestor of this clade as part of the cephalosporin-resistance transposon Tn6168 and has dispersed differently in each subclade. Members of subclade 1 share an ISAba1 in one specific position in the chromosome and in subclade 2 two different ISAba1 locations are shared. Further shared ISAba1 locations distinguish further divisions, potentially providing simple markers for epidemiological studies.","551":null,"552":"Helicobacter cinaedi is an emerging pathogen causing bacteraemia and cellulitis. Nosocomial transmission of this microbe has been described, but detailed molecular-epidemiological analyses have not been performed. Here, we describe the results of a multi-step genome-wide phylogenetic analysis of a suspected intra-hospital outbreak of H. cinaedi that occurred in a hospital in Japan. The outbreak was recognized by the infectious control team (ICT) of the hospital as a sudden increase in H. cinaedi bacteraemia. ICT defined this outbreak case based on 16S rRNA sequence data and epidemiological information, but were unable to determine the source and route of the infections. We therefore re-investigated this case using whole-genome sequencing (WGS). We first performed a species-wide analysis using publicly available genome sequences to understand the level of genomic diversity of this under-studied species. The clusters identified were then separately analysed using the genome sequence of a representative strain in each cluster as a reference. These analyses provided a high-level phylogenetic resolution of each cluster, identified a confident set of outbreak isolates, and discriminated them from other closely related but distinct clones, which were locally circulating and invaded the hospital during the same period. By considering the epidemiological data, possible strain transmission chains were inferred, which highlighted the role of asymptomatic carriers or environmental contamination. The emergence of a subclone with increased resistance to fluoroquinolones in the outbreak was also recognized. Our results demonstrate the impact of the use of a closely related genome as a reference to maximize the power of WGS.","553":"Describing the role of plasmids and their contribution to the exchange of genetic material among bacteria is essential for understanding the fields of plasmid epidemiology, microbial ecology, and commercial and synthetic microbiology. Broad-host-range (BHR) plasmids are those that are found not only in a single bacterial species, but in members of different taxonomic groups and are of significant interest to researchers in many fields. We applied a novel approach to computationally identify new BHR plasmids, in which we searched for highly similar cognate plasmids within a comprehensive plasmid database. After identifying 125 plasmid groups with highly similar cognates found in multiple taxa, we closely examined BHR plasmids found in multiple families. The majority of our identified BHR plasmids are found in members of the Enterobacteriaceae and closely related taxa, while three BHR plasmids of potential commercial significance were found in two species of Cyanobacteria. One plasmid with an exceptionally broad host range was found in both Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacterial species. This analysis demonstrates the utility of this method in identifying new BHR plasmids while highlighting unknown ranges of previously documented plasmids.","554":"The UK's native oak is under serious threat from Acute Oak Decline (AOD). Stem tissue necrosis is a primary symptom of AOD and several bacteria are associated with necrotic lesions. Two members of the lesion pathobiome, Brenneria goodwinii and Gibbsiella quercinecans, have been identified as causative agents of tissue necrosis. However, additional bacteria including Lonsdalea britannica and Rahnella species have been detected in the lesion microbiome, but their role in tissue degradation is unclear. Consequently, information on potential genome-encoded mechanisms for tissue necrosis is critical to understand the role and mechanisms used by bacterial members of the lesion pathobiome in the aetiology of AOD. Here, the whole genomes of bacteria isolated from AOD-affected trees were sequenced, annotated and compared against canonical bacterial phytopathogens and non-pathogenic symbionts. Using orthologous gene inference methods, shared virulence genes that retain the same function were identified. Furthermore, functional annotation of phytopathogenic virulence genes demonstrated that all studied members of the AOD lesion microbiota possessed genes associated with phytopathogens. However, the genome of B. goodwinii was the most characteristic of a necrogenic phytopathogen, corroborating previous pathological and metatranscriptomic studies that implicate it as the key causal agent of AOD lesions. Furthermore, we investigated the genome sequences of other AOD lesion microbiota to understand the potential ability of microbes to cause disease or contribute to pathogenic potential of organisms isolated from this complex pathobiome. The role of these members remains uncertain but some such as G. quercinecans may contribute to tissue necrosis through the release of necrotizing enzymes and may help more dangerous pathogens activate and realize their pathogenic potential or they may contribute as secondary\/opportunistic pathogens with the potential to act as accessory species for B. goodwinii. We demonstrate that in combination with ecological data, whole genome sequencing provides key insights into the pathogenic potential of bacterial species whether they be phytopathogens, part-contributors or stimulators of the pathobiome.","555":"The pathogen Flavobacterium psychrophilum is a major problem for the expanding salmonid fish farming industry in Sweden as well as worldwide. A better understanding of the phylogeography and infection routes of F. psychrophilum outbreaks could help to improve aquaculture profitability and the welfare of farmed fish while reducing the need for antibiotics. In the present study, high-throughput genome sequencing was applied to a collection of F. psychrophilum isolates (n=38) from outbreaks on fish farms in different regions of Sweden between 1988 and 2016. Antibiotic susceptibility tests were applied to a subset of the isolates and the results correlated to the presence of genetic resistance markers. We show that F. psychrophilum clones are not regionally biased and that new clones with a higher degree of antibiotic resistance have emerged nationwide during the study period. This supports previous theories of the importance of live fish and egg trade as a route of infection. Continuous monitoring of recovered isolates by high-throughput sequencing techniques in the future could facilitate tracing of clones within and between countries, as well as the detection of emergent virulent or antibiotic-resistant clones.

However, a notable amount of information about evolutionary and transmission processes in diverse populations can be lost unless the accessory genome is also taken into consideration. Here, we introduce panini (Pangenome Neighbour Identification for Bacterial Populations), a computationally scalable method for identifying the neighbours for each isolate in a data set using unsupervised machine learning with stochastic neighbour embedding based on the t-SNE (t-distributed stochastic neighbour embedding) algorithm. panini is browser-based and integrates with the Microreact platform for rapid online visualization and exploration of both core and accessory genome evolutionary signals, together with relevant epidemiological, geographical, temporal and other metadata. Several case studies with single- and multi-clone pneumococcal populations are presented to demonstrate the ability to identify biologically important signals from gene content data. panini is available at http:\/\/panini.pathogen.watch and code at http:\/\/gitlab.com\/cgps\/panini.","559":null,"560":"Carbapenem resistance is a rapidly growing threat to our ability to treat refractory bacterial infections. To understand how carbapenem resistance is mobilized and spread between pathogens, it is important to study the genetic context of the underlying resistance mechanisms. In this study, the resistomes of six clinical carbapenem-resistant isolates of five different species - Acinetobacter baumannii, Escherichia coli, two Klebsiella pneumoniae, Proteus mirabilis and Pseudomonas aeruginosa - were characterized using whole genome sequencing. All Enterobacteriaceae isolates and the A. baumannii isolate had acquired a large number of antimicrobial resistance genes (7-18 different genes per isolate), including the following encoding carbapenemases: blaKPC-2, blaOXA-48, blaOXA-72, blaNDM-1, blaNDM-7 and blaVIM-1. In addition, a novel version of blaSHV was discovered. Four new resistance plasmids were identified and their fully assembled sequences were verified using optical DNA mapping. Most of the resistance genes were co-localized on these and other plasmids, suggesting a risk for co-selection. In contrast, five out of six carbapenemase genes were present on plasmids with no or few other resistance genes. The expected level of resistance - based on acquired resistance determinants - was concordant with measured levels in most cases. There were, however, several important discrepancies for four of the six isolates concerning multiple classes of antibiotics. In conclusion, our results further elucidate the diversity of carbapenemases, their mechanisms of horizontal transfer and possible patterns of co-selection. The study also emphasizes the difficulty of using whole genome sequencing for antimicrobial susceptibility testing of pathogens with complex genotypes.","561":"Accurate orthologue identification is a vital component of bacterial comparative genomic studies, but many popular sequence-similarity-based approaches do not scale well to the large numbers of genomes that are now generated routinely. Furthermore, most approaches do not take gene synteny into account, which is useful information for disentangling paralogues. Here, we present SynerClust, a user-friendly synteny-aware tool based on synergy that can process thousands of genomes. SynerClust was designed to analyse genomes with high levels of local synteny, particularly prokaryotes, which have operon structure. SynerClust's run-time is optimized by selecting cluster representatives at each node in the phylogeny; thus, avoiding the need for exhaustive pairwise similarity searches. In benchmarking against Roary, Hieranoid2, PanX and Reciprocal Best Hit, SynerClust was able to more completely identify sets of core genes for datasets that included diverse strains, while using substantially less memory, and with scalability comparable to the fastest tools. Due to its scalability, ease of installation and use, and suitability for a variety of computing environments, orthogroup clustering using SynerClust will enable many large-scale prokaryotic comparative genomics efforts.","562":"Group A Streptococcus (GAS) is classified on the basis of the sequence of the gene encoding the M protein (emm) and the patterns into which emm types are grouped. We discovered a novel emm pattern in emm4 GAS, historically considered pattern E, arising from a fusion event between emm and the adjacent enn gene. We identified the emm-enn fusion event in 51 out of 52 emm4 GAS strains isolated by national surveillance in 2015. GAS isolates with an emm-enn fusion event completely replaced pattern E emm4 strains over a 4-year span in Houston (2013-2017). The novel emm-enn gene fusion and new emm pattern has potential vaccine implications.","563":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an extremely successful pathogen able to cause both acute and chronic infections in a range of hosts, utilizing a diverse arsenal of cell-associated and secreted virulence factors. A major cell-associated virulence factor, the Type IV pilus (T4P), is required for epithelial cell adherence and mediates a form of surface translocation termed twitching motility, which is necessary to establish a mature biofilm and actively expand these biofilms. P. aeruginosa twitching motility-mediated biofilm expansion is a coordinated, multicellular behaviour, allowing cells to rapidly colonize surfaces, including implanted medical devices. Although at least 44 proteins are known to be involved in the biogenesis, assembly and regulation of the T4P, with additional regulatory components and pathways implicated, it is unclear how these components and pathways interact to control these processes. In the current study, we used a global genomics-based random-mutagenesis technique, transposon directed insertion-site sequencing (TraDIS), coupled with a physical segregation approach, to identify all genes implicated in twitching motility-mediated biofilm expansion in P. aeruginosa. Our approach allowed identification of both known and novel genes, providing new insight into the complex molecular network that regulates this process in P. aeruginosa. Additionally, our data suggest that the flagellum-associated gene products have a differential effect on twitching motility, based on whether components are intra- or extracellular. Overall the success of our TraDIS approach supports the use of this global genomic technique for investigating virulence genes in bacterial pathogens.","564":"Assembly of bacterial short-read whole-genome sequencing data frequently results in hundreds of contigs for which the origin, plasmid or chromosome, is unclear. Complete genomes resolved by long-read sequencing can be used to generate and label short-read contigs. These were used to train several popular machine learning methods to classify the origin of contigs from Enterococcus faecium, Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli using pentamer frequencies. We selected support-vector machine (SVM) models as the best classifier for all three bacterial species (F1-score E. faecium=0.92, F1-score K. pneumoniae=0.90, F1-score E. coli=0.76), which outperformed other existing plasmid prediction tools using a benchmarking set of isolates. We demonstrated the scalability of our models by accurately predicting the plasmidome of a large collection of 1644 E. faecium isolates and illustrate its applicability by predicting the location of antibiotic-resistance genes in all three species. The SVM classifiers are publicly available as an R package and graphical-user interface called 'mlplasmids'. We anticipate that this tool may significantly facilitate research on the dissemination of plasmids encoding antibiotic resistance and\/or contributing to host adaptation.","565":"","566":"Hypermutable simple sequence repeats (SSRs) are drivers of phase variation (PV) whose stochastic, high-frequency, reversible switches in gene expression are a common feature of several pathogenic bacterial species, including the human pathogen Campylobacter jejuni. Here we examine the distribution and conservation of known and putative SSR-driven phase variable genes - the phasome - in the genus Campylobacter. PhasomeIt, a new program, was specifically designed for rapid identification of SSR-mediated PV. This program detects the location, type and repeat number of every SSR. Each SSR is linked to a specific gene and its putative expression state. Other outputs include conservation of SSR-driven phase-variable genes and the 'core phasome' - the minimal set of PV genes in a phylogenetic grouping. Analysis of 77 complete Campylobacter genome sequences detected a 'core phasome' of conserved PV genes in each species and a large number of rare PV genes with few, or no, homologues in other genome sequences. Analysis of a set of partial genome sequences, with food-chain-associated metadata, detected evidence of a weak link between phasome and source host for disease-causing isolates of sequence type (ST)-828 but not the ST-21 or ST-45 complexes. Investigation of the phasomes in the genus Campylobacter provided evidence of overlapping but distinctive mechanisms of PV-mediated adaptation to specific niches. This suggests that the phasome could be involved in host adaptation and spread of campylobacters. Finally, this tool is malleable and will have utility for studying the distribution and genic effects of other repetitive elements in diverse bacterial species.","567":null,"568":null,"569":"We recently identified clonal complex 10 (CC10) Escherichia coli as the predominant clonal group in two populations of healthy Australian food-production pigs. CC10 are highly successful, colonizing humans, food-production animals, fresh produce and environmental niches. Furthermore, E. coli within CC10 are frequently drug resistant and increasingly reported as human and animal extra-intestinal pathogens. In order to develop a high-resolution global phylogeny and determine the repertoire of antimicrobial-resistance genes, virulence-associated genes and plasmid types within this clonal group, we downloaded 228 publicly available CC10 short-read genome sequences for comparison with 20 porcine CC10 we have previously described. Core genome single nucleotide polymorphism phylogeny revealed a highly diverse global phylogeny consisting of multiple lineages that did not cluster by geography or source of the isolates. Australian porcine strains belonged to several of these divergent lineages, indicative that CC10 is present in these animals due to multiple colonization events. Differences in resistance gene and plasmid carriage between porcine strains and the global collection highlighted the role of lateral gene transfer in the evolution of CC10 strains. Virulence profiles typical of extra-intestinal pathogenic E. coli were present in both Australian porcine strains and the broader collection. As both the core phylogeny and accessory gene characteristics appeared unrelated to the geography or source of the isolates, it is likely that the global expansion of CC10 is not a recent event and may be associated with faecal carriage in humans.","570":null,"571":"","572":"","573":"Plasmid prediction may be of great interest when studying bacteria of medical importance such as Enterobacteriaceae as well as Staphylococcus aureus or Enterococcus. Indeed, many resistance and virulence genes are located on such replicons with major impact in terms of pathogenicity and spreading capacities. Beyond strain outbreak, plasmid outbreaks have been reported in particular for some extended-spectrum beta-lactamase- or carbapenemase-producing Enterobacteriaceae. Several tools are now available to explore the 'plasmidome' from whole-genome sequences with various approaches, but none of them are able to combine high sensitivity and specificity. With this in mind, we developed PlaScope, a targeted approach to recover plasmidic sequences in genome assemblies at the species or genus level. Based on Centrifuge, a metagenomic classifier, and a custom database containing complete sequences of chromosomes and plasmids from various curated databases, PlaScope classifies contigs from an assembly according to their predicted location. Compared to other plasmid classifiers, PlasFlow and cBar, it achieves better recall (0.87), specificity (0.99), precision (0.96) and accuracy (0.98) on a dataset of 70 genomes of Escherichia coli containing plasmids. In a second part, we identified 20 of the 21 chromosomal integrations of the extended-spectrum beta-lactamase coding gene in a clinical dataset of E. coli strains. In addition, we predicted virulence gene and operon locations in agreement with the literature. We also built a database for Klebsiella and correctly assigned the location for the majority of resistance genes from a collection of 12 Klebsiella pneumoniae strains. Similar approaches could also be developed for other well-characterized bacteria.","574":null,"575":null,"576":"Novel adenovirus genotypes are associated with outbreaks of disease, such as acute gastroenteritis, renal disease, upper respiratory tract infection and keratoconjunctivitis.

A novel species D virus, designated genotype 90 (P33H27F67) was identified, and the partial genome of a putative recombinant species B virus was recovered. Furthermore, the enteric types HAdV-A61 and HAdV-A40 were found in stool specimens.

Indeed, it is one of the most common bacteria found in the rumen and plays an important role in ruminal fermentation of polysaccharides, yet, to date, there is no closed reference genome published for this species in any ruminant animal. We successfully assembled the nearly complete genome sequence of B. fibrisolvens strain INBov1 isolated from cow rumen using Illumina paired-end reads, 454 Roche single-end and mate pair sequencing technology. Additionally, we constructed an optical restriction map of this strain to aid in scaffold ordering and positioning, and completed the first genomic structure of this species. Moreover, we identified and assembled the first chromid of this species (pINBov266). The INBov1 genome encodes a large set of genes involved in the cellulolytic process but lacks key genes. This seems to indicate that B. fibrisolvens plays an important role in ruminal cellulolytic processes, but does not have autonomous cellulolytic capacity. When searching for genes involved in the biohydrogenation of unsaturated fatty acids, no linoleate isomerase gene was found in this strain. INBov1 does encode oleate hydratase genes known to participate in the hydrogenation of oleic acids. Furthermore, INBov1 contains an enolase gene, which has been recently determined to participate in the synthesis of conjugated linoleic acids. This work confirms the presence of a novel chromid in B. fibrisolvens and provides a new potential reference genome sequence for this species, providing new insight into its role in biohydrogenation and carbohydrate degradation.","580":"Haemophilus influenzae, originally named Pfeiffer's bacillus after its discoverer Richard Pfeiffer in 1892, was a major risk for global health at the beginning of the 20th century, causing childhood pneumonia and invasive disease as well as otitis media and other upper respiratory tract infections. The implementation of the Hib vaccine, targeting the major capsule type of H. influenzae, almost eradicated the disease in countries that adapted the vaccination scheme. However, a rising number of infections are caused by non-typeable H. influenzae (NTHi), which has no capsule and against which the vaccine therefore provides no protection, as well as other serotypes equally not recognised by the vaccine. The first line of treatment is ampicillin, but there is a steady rise in ampicillin resistance. This is both through acquired as well as intrinsic mechanisms, and is cause for serious concern and the need for more surveillance. There are also increasing reports of new modifications of the intrinsic ampicillin-resistance mechanism leading to resistance against cephalosporins and carbapenems, the last line of well-tolerated drugs, and ampicillin-resistant H. influenzae was included in the recently released priority list of antibiotic-resistant bacteria by the WHO.

Although widely studied in bacteria, in archaea the effect of genomic instability on organism phenotypes and fitness remains unclear. Here we use DNA segmentation methods to detect and quantify genome-wide copy number variation (CNV) in large compendia of high-throughput datasets in a model archaeal species, Halobacterium salinarum. CNV hotspots were identified throughout the genome. Some hotspots were strongly associated with changes in gene expression, suggesting a mechanism for phenotypic innovation. In contrast, CNV hotspots in other genomic loci left expression unchanged, suggesting buffering of certain phenotypes. The correspondence of CNVs with gene expression was validated with strain- and condition-matched transcriptomics and DNA quantification experiments at specific loci. Significant correlation of CNV hotspot locations with the positions of known insertion sequence (IS) elements suggested a mechanism for generating genomic instability. Given the efficient recombination capabilities in H. salinarum despite stability at the single nucleotide level, these results suggest that genomic plasticity mediated by IS element activity can provide a source of phenotypic innovation in extreme environments.","583":"Cyanobacteria form one of the most diversified phyla of Bacteria. They are important ecologically as primary producers, for Earth evolution and biotechnological applications. Yet, Cyanobacteria are notably difficult to purify and grow axenically, and most strains in culture collections contain heterotrophic bacteria that were probably associated with Cyanobacteria in the environment. Obtaining cyanobacterial DNA without contaminant sequences is thus a challenging and time-consuming task. Here, we describe a metagenomic pipeline that enables the easy recovery of genomes from non-axenic cultures. We tested this pipeline on 17 cyanobacterial cultures from the BCCM\/ULC public collection and generated novel genome sequences for 12 polar or subpolar strains and three temperate ones, including three early-branching organisms that will be useful for phylogenomics. In parallel, we assembled 31 co-cultivated bacteria (12 nearly complete) from the same cultures and showed that they mostly belong to Bacteroidetes and Proteobacteria, some of them being very closely related in spite of geographically distant sampling sites.","584":"Stenotrophomonas maltophilia has evolved as one of the leading multidrug-resistant pathogens responsible for a variety of nosocomial infections especially in highly debilitated patients. As information on the genomic and intraspecies diversity of this clinically important pathogen is limited, we sequenced the whole genome of 27 clinical isolates from hospitalized patients. Phylogenomic analysis along with the genomes of type strains suggested that the clinical isolates are distributed over the Stenotrophomonas maltophilia complex (Smc) within the genus Stenotrophomonas. Further genome-based taxonomy coupled with the genomes of type strains of the genus Stenotrophomonas allowed us to identify five cryptic genomospecies, which are associated with the clinical isolates of S. maltophilia and are potentially novel species. These isolates share a very small core genome that implies a high level of genetic diversity within the isolates. Recombination analysis of core genomes revealed that the impact of recombination is more than mutation in the diversification of clinical S. maltophilia isolates. Distribution analysis of well-characterized antibiotic-resistance and efflux pump genes of S. maltophilia across multiple novel genomospecies provided insights into its antibiotic-resistant ability. This study supports the existence of multiple cryptic species within the Smc besides S. maltophilia, which are associated with human infections, and highlights the importance of genome-based approaches to delineate bacterial species. This data will aid in improving clinical diagnosis and for understanding species-specific clinical manifestations of infection due to Stenotrophomonas species.","585":null,"586":null,"587":"The genus Neisseria comprises a diverse group of commensal bacteria, which typically colonize the mucosal surfaces of humans and other animals. Neisseria meningitidis, the meningococcus, is notable for its potential to cause invasive meningococcal disease (IMD) in humans; however, IMD is comparatively rare, and meningococci normally colonize the nasopharynx asymptomatically. Possession of a polysaccharide capsule has been shown to be a prerequisite for disease in almost all IMD cases, and was previously considered unique to N. meningitidis, and potentially acquired by horizontal genetic transfer (HGT). Nevertheless, the capsule must also have some role in asymptomatic colonization and\/or transmission, consistent with the existence of six non-disease-associated meningococcal capsule serogroups. In this study, full complements of putative capsule genes were identified in non-pathogenic Neisseria species, including Neisseria subflava and Neisseria elongata. These species contained genes for capsule transport and translocation homologous to those of N. meningitidis, as well as novel putative capsule synthesis genes. Phylogenetic analyses were consistent with the proposal that these genes were acquired by the meningococcus through HGT. In contrast with previous evolutionary models, however, the most parsimonious explanation of these data was that capsule transport genes had been lost in the common ancestor of the meningococcus, gonococcus, and their close relatives, and then reacquired by some meningococci. The most likely donor of the meningococcal transport genes was another Neisseria species.","588":null,"589":"Several Gram-negative soil bacteria have the ability to differentiate into dormant cysts when faced with harsh environmental conditions.

Currently, little is known about either the metabolic differences that exist between vegetative and cyst cell types, or about aspects of cyst physiology that allow dormant cells to survive harsh conditions. Here we compared transcriptomic profiles of vegetative and encysted A. brasilense. We observed that approximately one fifth of the A. brasilense transcriptome undergoes changes in expression between replicative vegetative cells and non-replicative cysts. A dramatic alteration in expression of genes involved in cell wall or cell membrane biogenesis was observed, which is congruent with changes in exopolysaccharide and lipid composition that occur between these cell types. Encysted cells also exhibited repressed mRNA abundance of genes involved in amino acid biosynthesis, ribosomal biogenesis and translation. We further observed that cysts create an anaerobic\/micro-aerobic environment, as evidenced by repressed expression of oxidative phosphorylation genes coupled with increased expression of nitrate\/nitrite reduction and nitrogen fixation genes.","590":"Salmonella enterica serovar Montevideo has been linked to recent foodborne illness outbreaks resulting from contamination of products such as fruits, vegetables, seeds and spices.

This disparity fuelled our interest in characterizing the genomic differences between Montevideo strains isolated from healthy cattle and beef products, and those isolated from human patients and outbreak sources. To that end, we sequenced 13 Montevideo strains to completion, producing high-quality genome assemblies of isolates from human patients (n=8) or from healthy cattle at slaughter (n=5). Comparative analysis of sequence data from this study and publicly available sequences (n=72) shows that Montevideo falls into four previously established clades, differentially occupied by cattle and human strains. The results of these analyses reveal differences in metabolic islands, environmental adhesion determinants and virulence factors within each clade, and suggest explanations for the infrequent association between bovine isolates and human illnesses.","591":null,"592":null,"593":null,"594":null,"595":"Members of the genus Campylobacter remain a leading cause of bacterial gastroenteritis worldwide.

By contrast, invasive non-typhoidal Salmonella cause bloodstream infections associated with high mortality, particularly in sub-Saharan Africa. Most Salmonella strains from clinical sources are resistant to first-line antibiotics, with FQs now being the antibiotic of choice for treatment of invasive Salmonella infections. However, FQ resistance is increasingly being reported in Salmonella, and multiple molecular mechanisms are already described. Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) is becoming more frequently used to analyse bacterial genomes for antibiotic-resistance markers, and to understand the phylogeny of bacteria in relation to their antibiotic-resistance profiles.

Accordingly, their functional attributes have been exploited industrially and several strains are commonly formulated as probiotics or starter cultures in the food industry. Although divergent evolutionary processes have yielded the acquisition and evolution of specialized functionalities, all Lactobacillus species share a small set of core metabolic properties, including the glycolysis pathway. Thus, the sequences of glycolytic enzymes afford a means to establish phylogenetic groups with the potential to discern species that are too closely related from a 16S rRNA standpoint. Here, we identified and extracted glycolysis enzyme sequences from 52 species, and carried out individual and concatenated phylogenetic analyses. We show that a glycolysis-based phylogenetic tree can robustly segregate lactobacilli into distinct clusters and discern very closely related species. We also compare and contrast evolutionary patterns with genome-wide features and transcriptomic patterns, reflecting genomic drift trends. Overall, results suggest that glycolytic enzymes provide valuable phylogenetic insights and may constitute practical targets for evolutionary studies.","600":null,"601":"","602":"Species of the genus Macrococcus are widespread commensals of animals but are becoming increasingly recognised as veterinary pathogens. They can encode methicillin resistance and are implicated in its spread to the closely-related, but more pathogenic, staphylococci. In this study we have identified 33 isolates of methicillin-resistant Macrococcus caseolyticus from bovine bulk tank milk from England and Wales. These isolates were characterised to provide insight into the molecular epidemiology of M. caseolyticus and to discern the genetic basis for their methicillin resistance. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed by Vitek2 and disc diffusion. Isolates were whole-genome sequenced to evaluate phylogenetic relationships and the presence of methicillin resistance determinants, mecA-D. All 33 isolates were phenotypically methicillin-resistant according to cefoxitin disc diffusion, cefoxitin Etest and oxacillin resistance assessed by Vitek2. In contrast only a single isolate was resistant in the Vitek2 cefoxitin screen. Twenty-seven isolates were positive for mecD and six were positive for mecB. mecA and mecC were not detected. The results of phylogenetic analysis indicated that these methicillin-resistant isolates represented a heterogeneous population with both mecB and mecD found in diverse isolates. Isolates had a widespread distribution across the sampled region. Taken together with the role of M. caseolyticus in veterinary infections, including bovine mastitis, and in the potential spread of methicillin resistance to more pathogenic staphylococci, this work highlights the need to better understand their epidemiology and for increased awareness among veterinary microbiology laboratories.","603":null,"604":null,"605":"Bifidobacterium is a diverse genus of anaerobic, saccharolytic bacteria that colonize many animals, notably humans and other mammals. The presence of these bacteria in the gastrointestinal tract represents a potential coevolution between the gut microbiome and its mammalian host mediated by diet. To study the relationship between bifidobacterial gut symbionts and host nutrition, we analyzed the genome of two bifidobacteria strains isolated from the feces of a common marmoset (Callithrix jacchus), a primate species studied for its ability to subsist on host-indigestible carbohydrates. Whole genome sequencing identified these isolates as unique strains of Bifidobacterium callitrichos. All three strains, including these isolates and the previously described type strain, contain genes that may enable utilization of marmoset dietary substrates. These include genes predicted to contribute to galactose, arabinose, and trehalose metabolic pathways. In addition, significant genomic differences between strains suggest that bifidobacteria possess distinct roles in carbohydrate metabolism within the same host. Thus, bifidobacteria utilize dietary components specific to their host, both humans and non-human primates alike. Comparative genomics suggests conservation of possible coevolutionary relationships within the primate clade.","606":"Pathogen monitoring is becoming more precise as sequencing technologies become more affordable and accessible worldwide. This transition is especially apparent in the field of food safety, which has demonstrated how whole-genome sequencing (WGS) can be used on a global scale to protect public health. GenomeTrakr coordinates the WGS performed by public-health agencies and other partners by providing a public database with real-time cluster analysis for foodborne pathogen surveillance. Because WGS is being used to support enforcement decisions, it is essential to have confidence in the quality of the data being used and the downstream data analyses that guide these decisions. Routine proficiency tests, such as the one described here, have an important role in ensuring the validity of both data and procedures. In 2015, the GenomeTrakr proficiency test distributed eight isolates of common foodborne pathogens to participating laboratories, who were required to follow a specific protocol for performing WGS. Resulting sequence data were evaluated for several metrics, including proper labelling, sequence quality and new single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs). Illumina MiSeq sequence data collected for the same set of strains across 21 different laboratories exhibited high reproducibility, while revealing a narrow range of technical and biological variance. The numbers of SNPs reported for sequencing runs of the same isolates across multiple laboratories support the robustness of our cluster analysis pipeline in that each individual isolate cultured and resequenced multiple times in multiple places are all easily identifiable as originating from the same source.","607":"Xanthomonas fragariae is a quarantine organism in Europe, causing angular leaf spots on strawberry plants. It is spreading worldwide in strawberry-producing regions due to import of plant material through trade and human activities. In order to resolve the population structure at the strain level, we have employed high-resolution molecular typing tools on a comprehensive strain collection representing global and temporal distribution of the pathogen. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat regions (CRISPRs) and variable number of tandem repeats (VNTRs) were identified within the reference genome of X. fragariae LMG 25863 as a potential source of variation. Strains from our collection were whole-genome sequenced and used in order to identify variable spacers and repeats for discriminative purpose. CRISPR spacer analysis and multiple-locus VNTR analysis (MLVA) displayed a congruent population structure, in which two major groups and a total of four subgroups were revealed. The two main groups were genetically separated before the first X. fragariae isolate was described and are potentially responsible for the worldwide expansion of the bacterial disease. Three primer sets were designed for discriminating CRISPR-associated markers in order to streamline group determination of novel isolates. Overall, this study describes typing methods to discriminate strains and monitor the pathogen population structure, more especially in the view of a new outbreak of the pathogen.","608":"","609":null,"610":"The potential for genome-wide modelling of epistasis has recently surfaced given the possibility of sequencing densely sampled populations and the emerging families of statistical interaction models. Direct coupling analysis (DCA) has previously been shown to yield valuable predictions for single protein structures, and has recently been extended to genome-wide analysis of bacteria, identifying novel interactions in the co-evolution between resistance, virulence and core genome elements. However, earlier computational DCA methods have not been scalable to enable model fitting simultaneously to 104-105 polymorphisms, representing the amount of core genomic variation observed in analyses of many bacterial species. Here, we introduce a novel inference method (SuperDCA) that employs a new scoring principle, efficient parallelization, optimization and filtering on phylogenetic information to achieve scalability for up to 105 polymorphisms. Using two large population samples of Streptococcus pneumoniae, we demonstrate the ability of SuperDCA to make additional significant biological findings about this major human pathogen. We also show that our method can uncover signals of selection that are not detectable by genome-wide association analysis, even though our analysis does not require phenotypic measurements. SuperDCA, thus, holds considerable potential in building understanding about numerous organisms at a systems biological level.","611":"Most Vibrio parahaemolyticus isolates found in marine environments are non-pathogenic; however, certain lineages have acquired genomic pathogenicity islands (PAIs) that enable these isolates to cause human illness. The V. parahaemolyticus PAI contains one or both of two toxins: thermostable direct haemolysin (TDH) or TDH-related haemolysin (TRH) and type III secretion system 2 (T3SS2). Recently, a few V. parahaemolyticus isolates that do not have this PAI were obtained from clinical samples, and there has been interest in determining whether these isolates possess novel virulence factors. In this investigation, we have selected four V. parahaemolyticus isolates: a canonical pathogenic strain containing TDH, TRH and T3SS2; two strains from clinical cases which do not contain a PAI; and an environmental isolate which also does not contain a PAI. For each isolate, we analyzed differential gene expression after crude bile exposure. Several enteric bacterial pathogens are known to use bile as a signal to enhance virulence gene expression. We have shown that in the tdh-positive trh-positive pathotype gene virulence gene expression was not up-regulated in response to crude bile, strongly indicating that the current dogma of virulence gene regulation in V. parahaemolyticus needs to be revisited and separately investigated for each pathotype. In addition, we have created a list of genes of interest that were up-regulated in the non-canonical pathotypes which may contribute to virulence in these isolates.","612":null,"613":"Serratia grimesii BXF1 is a bacterium with the ability to modulate the development of several eukaryotic hosts. Strain BXF1 was isolated from the pinewood nematode, Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, the causative agent of pine wilt disease affecting pine forests worldwide. This bacterium potentiates Bursaphelenchus xylophilus reproduction, acts as a beneficial pine endophyte, and possesses fungal and bacterial antagonistic activities, further indicating a complex role in a wide range of trophic relationships. In this work, we describe and analyse the genome sequence of strain BXF1, and discuss several important aspects of its ecological role. Genome analysis indicates the presence of several genes related to the observed production of antagonistic traits, plant growth regulation and the modulation of nematode development. Moreover, most of the BXF1 genes are involved in environmental and genetic information processing, which is consistent with its ability to sense and colonize several niches. The results obtained in this study provide the basis to a better understanding of the role and evolution of strain BXF1 as a mediator of interactions between organisms involved in a complex disease system. These results may also bring new insights into general Serratia and Enterobacteriaceae evolution towards multitrophic interactions.","614":null,"615":"Although the genome of Trypanosoma cruzi, the causative agent of Chagas disease, was first made available in 2005, with additional strains reported later, the intrinsic genome complexity of this parasite (the abundance of repetitive sequences and genes organized in tandem) has traditionally hindered high-quality genome assembly and annotation. This also limits diverse types of analyses that require high degrees of precision. Long reads generated by third-generation sequencing technologies are particularly suitable to address the challenges associated with T. cruzi's genome since they permit direct determination of the full sequence of large clusters of repetitive sequences without collapsing them. This, in turn, not only allows accurate estimation of gene copy numbers but also circumvents assembly fragmentation. Here, we present the analysis of the genome sequences of two T. cruzi clones: the hybrid TCC (TcVI) and the non-hybrid Dm28c (TcI), determined by PacBio Single Molecular Real-Time (SMRT) technology. The improved assemblies herein obtained permitted us to accurately estimate gene copy numbers, abundance and distribution of repetitive sequences (including satellites and retroelements). We found that the genome of T. cruzi is composed of a 'core compartment' and a 'disruptive compartment' which exhibit opposite GC content and gene composition. Novel tandem and dispersed repetitive sequences were identified, including some located inside coding sequences. Additionally, homologous chromosomes were separately assembled, allowing us to retrieve haplotypes as separate contigs instead of a unique mosaic sequence. Finally, manual annotation of surface multigene families, mucins and trans-sialidases allows now a better overview of these complex groups of genes.","616":"Ensifer meliloti (formerly Rhizobium meliloti and Sinorhizobium meliloti) is a model bacterium for understanding legume-rhizobial symbioses. The tripartite genome of E. meliloti consists of a chromosome, pSymA and pSymB, and in some instances strain-specific accessory plasmids. The majority of previous sequencing studies have relied on the use of assemblies generated from short read sequencing, which leads to gaps and assembly errors. Here we used PacBio-based, long-read assemblies and were able to assemble, de novo, complete circular replicons. In this study, we sequenced, de novo-assembled and analysed 10 E. meliloti strains. Sequence comparisons were also done with data from six previously published genomes. We identified genome differences between the replicons, including mol% G+C and gene content, nucleotide repeats, and transposon-associated loci. Additionally, genomic rearrangements both within and between replicons were identified, providing insight into evolutionary processes at the structural level. There were few cases of inter-replicon gene transfer of core genes between the main replicons. Accessory plasmids were more similar to pSymA than to either pSymB or the chromosome, with respect to gene content, transposon content and G+C content. In our population, the accessory plasmids appeared to share an open genome with pSymA, which contains many nodulation- and nitrogen fixation-related genes. This may explain previous observations that horizontal gene transfer has a greater effect on the content of pSymA than pSymB, or the chromosome, and why some rhizobia show unstable nodulation phenotypes on legume hosts.","617":null,"618":null,"619":null,"620":"The order Sphingomonadales is a taxon of bacteria with a variety of physiological features and carotenoid pigments. Some of the coloured strains within this order are known to be aerobic anoxygenic phototrophs that contain characteristic photosynthesis gene clusters (PGCs). Previous work has shown that majority of the ORFs putatively involved in the biosynthesis of C40 carotenoids are located outside the PGCs in these strains. The main purpose of this study was to understand the genetic basis for the various colour\/carotenoid phenotypes of the strains of Sphingomonadales. Comparative analyses of the genomes of 41 strains of this order revealed that there were different patterns of clustering of carotenoid biosynthesis (crt) ORFs, with four ORF clusters being the most common. The analyses also revealed that co-occurrence of crtY and crtI is an evolutionarily conserved feature in Sphingomonadales and other carotenogenic bacteria. The comparisons facilitated the categorisation of bacteria of this order into four groups based on the presence of different crt ORFs. Yellow coloured strains most likely accumulate nostoxanthin, and contain six ORFs (group I: crtE, crtB, crtI, crtY, crtZ, crtG). Orange coloured strains may produce adonixanthin, astaxanthin, canthaxanthin and erythroxanthin, and contain seven ORFs (group II: crtE, crtB, crtI, crtY, crtZ, crtG, crtW). Red coloured strains may accumulate astaxanthin, and contain six ORFs (group III: crtE, crtB, crtI, crtY, crtZ, crtW). Non-pigmented strains may contain a smaller subset of crt ORFs, and thus fail to produce any carotenoids (group IV). The functions of many of these ORFs remain to be characterised.","621":null,"622":null,"623":"Shigella are ranked among the most prevalent aetiologies of diarrhoeal disease worldwide, disproportionately affecting young children in developing countries and high-risk communities in developed settings. Antimicrobial treatment, most commonly with fluoroquinolones, is currently recommended for Shigella infections to alleviate symptoms and control disease transmission. Resistance to fluoroquinolones has emerged in differing Shigella species (S. dysenteriae, flexneri and sonnei) since the turn of the 21st century, originating in endemic areas, and latterly spreading into non-endemic regions. Despite occurring independently, the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in these different Shigella species shares striking similarities regarding their epidemiology and resistance mechanisms. Here, we review and discuss the current epidemiology of fluoroquinolone-resistant Shigella species, particularly in the light of recent genomic insights.","624":"In Bacteria, a working consensus of species circumscription may have been reached and one of the most prominent criteria is high average nucleotide identity (ANI). ANI in effect groups strains that may recombine more or less frequently, depending on their biology, as opposed to rare interspecies gene transfer. For bacteriophages, which show various lifestyles, the nature of the fundamental natural unit, if it exists in a biological sense, is not well understood and defined. The approaches based on dot-plots are useful to group similar bacteriophages, yet are not quantitative and use arbitrarily set cut-offs. Here, we focus on lytic Myoviridae and test the ANI metric for group delineation. We show that ANI-based groups are in agreement with the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) classification and already established dot-plot groups, which are occasionally further refined owing to higher resolution of ANI analysis. Furthermore, these groups are separated among themselves by clear ANI discontinuities. Their members readily exchange core genes with each other while they do not with bacteriophages of other ANI groups, not even with the most similar. Thus, ANI-delineated groups may represent the natural units in lytic Myoviridae evolution with features that resemble those encountered in bacterial species.","625":null,"626":null,"627":null,"628":null,"629":null,"630":"Gene-by-gene approaches are becoming increasingly popular in bacterial genomic epidemiology and outbreak detection.

However, much of this information is ignored. This is because linking this metadata to genes, or regions of the genome, usually relies on knowing the gene sequence(s) responsible for the particular trait being measured and looking for its presence or absence in that genome. Examples of this would be the spread of antimicrobial resistance genes carried on mobile genetic elements (MGEs). However, although it is possible to routinely identify the resistance gene, identifying the unknown MGE upon which it is carried can be much more difficult if the starting point is short-read whole-genome sequence data. The reason for this is that MGEs are often full of repeats and so assemble poorly, leading to fragmented consensus sequences. Since mobile DNA, which can carry many clinically and ecologically important genes, has a different evolutionary history from the host, its distribution across the host population will, by definition, be independent of the host phylogeny. It is possible to use this phenomenon in a genome-wide association study to identify both the genes associated with the specific trait and also the DNA linked to that gene, for example the flanking sequence of the plasmid vector on which it is encoded, which follows the same patterns of distribution as the marker gene\/sequence itself. We present PlasmidTron, which utilizes the phenotypic data normally available in bacterial population studies, such as antibiograms, virulence factors, or geographical information, to identify traits that are likely to be present on DNA that can randomly reassort across defined bacterial populations. It is also possible to use this methodology to associate unknown genes\/sequences (e.g. plasmid backbones) with a specific molecular signature or marker (e.g. resistance gene presence or absence) using PlasmidTron. PlasmidTron uses a k-mer-based approach to identify reads associated with a phylogenetically unlinked phenotype. These reads are then assembled de novo to produce contigs in a fast and scalable-to-large manner. PlasmidTron is written in Python 3 and is available under the open source licence GNU GPL3 from https:\/\/github.com\/sanger-pathogens\/plasmidtron.","632":"Salmonella enterica serovar Enteritidis is a major agent of foodborne diseases worldwide. In Uruguay, this serovar was almost negligible until the mid 1990s but since then it has become the most prevalent. Previously, we characterized a collection of strains isolated from 1988 to 2005 and found that the two oldest strains were the most genetically divergent. In order to further characterize these strains, we sequenced and annotated eight genomes including those of the two oldest isolates. We report on the identification and characterization of a novel 44 kbp Salmonella prophage found exclusively in these two genomes. Sequence analysis reveals that the prophage is a mosaic, with homologous regions in different Salmonella prophages. It contains 60 coding sequences, including two genes, gogB and sseK3, involved in virulence and modulation of host immune response. Analysis of serovar Enteritidis genomes available in public databases confirmed that this prophage is absent in most of them, with the exception of a group of 154 genomes. All 154 strains carrying this prophage belong to the same sequence type (ST-1974), suggesting that its acquisition occurred in a common ancestor. We tested this by phylogenetic analysis of 203 genomes representative of the intraserovar diversity. The ST-1974 forms a distinctive monophyletic lineage, and the newly described prophage is a phylogenetic signature of this lineage that could be used as a molecular marker. The phylogenetic analysis also shows that the major ST (ST-11) is polyphyletic and might have given rise to almost all other STs, including ST-1974.","633":null,"634":null,"635":"","636":"Next-generation sequencing (NGS) methods are low-cost high-throughput technologies that produce thousands to millions of sequence reads. Despite the high number of raw sequence reads, their short length, relative to Sanger, PacBio or Nanopore reads, complicates the assembly of genomic repeats. Many genome tools are available, but the assembly of highly repetitive genome sequences using only NGS short reads remains challenging. Genome assembly of organisms responsible for important neglected diseases such as Trypanosoma cruzi, the aetiological agent of Chagas disease, is known to be challenging because of their repetitive nature. Only three of six recognized discrete typing units (DTUs) of the parasite have their draft genomes published and therefore genome evolution analyses in the taxon are limited. In this study, we developed a computational workflow to assemble highly repetitive genomes via a combination of de novo and reference-based assembly strategies to better overcome the intrinsic limitations of each, based on Illumina reads. The highly repetitive genome of the human-infecting parasite T. cruzi 231 strain was used as a test subject. The combined-assembly approach shown in this study benefits from the reference-based assembly ability to resolve highly repetitive sequences and from the de novo capacity to assemble genome-specific regions, improving the quality of the assembly. The acceptable confidence obtained by analyzing our results showed that our combined approach is an attractive option to assemble highly repetitive genomes with NGS short reads. Phylogenomic analysis including the 231 strain, the first representative of DTU III whose genome was sequenced, was also performed and provides new insights into T. cruzi genome evolution.","637":null,"638":"The increasing prevalence of KPC-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae strains in clinical settings has been largely attributed to dissemination of organisms of specific multilocus sequence types, such as ST258 and ST11. Compared with the ST258 clone, which is prevalent in North America and Europe, ST11 is common in China but information regarding its genetic features remains scarce. In this study, we performed detailed genetic characterization of ST11 K. pneumoniae strains by analyzing whole-genome sequences of 58 clinical strains collected from diverse geographic locations in China. The ST11 genomes were found to be highly heterogeneous and clustered into at least three major lineages based on the patterns of single-nucleotide polymorphisms. Exhibiting five different capsular types, these ST11 strains were found to harbor multiple resistance and virulence determinants such as the blaKPC-2 gene, which encodes carbapenemase, and the yersiniabactin-associated virulence genes irp, ybt and fyu. Moreover, genes encoding the virulence factor aerobactin and the regulator of the mucoid phenotype (rmpA) were detectable in six genomes, whereas genes encoding salmochelin were found in three genomes. In conclusion, our data indicated that carriage of a wide range of resistance and virulence genes constitutes the underlying basis of the high level of prevalence of ST11 in clinical settings. Such findings provide insight into the development of novel strategies for prevention, diagnosis and treatment of K. pneumoniae infections.","639":"Sporulation is a survival strategy, adapted by bacterial cells in response to harsh environmental adversities. The adaptation potential differs between strains and the variations may arise from differences in gene regulation. Gene networks are a valuable way of studying such regulation processes and establishing associations between genes. We reconstructed and compared sporulation gene co-expression networks (GCNs) of the model laboratory strain Bacillus subtilis 168 and the food-borne industrial isolate Bacillus amyloliquefaciens. Transcriptome data obtained from samples of six stages during the sporulation process were used for network inference. Subsequently, a gene set enrichment analysis was performed to compare the reconstructed GCNs of B. subtilis 168 and B. amyloliquefaciens with respect to biological functions, which showed the enriched modules with coherent functional groups associated with sporulation. On basis of the GCNs and time-evolution of differentially expressed genes, we could identify novel candidate genes strongly associated with sporulation in B. subtilis 168 and B. amyloliquefaciens. The GCNs offer a framework for exploring transcription factors, their targets, and co-expressed genes during sporulation.

Here, we analysed the transcriptomes of two commonly used clinical isolates, Af293 and CEA10, during infection of the A549 type II pneumocyte cell line in vitro. We focused our RNA-seq analysis on the core set of genes that are present in the genomes of the two strains. Our results suggest that: (a) A. fumigatus does not mount a conserved transcriptional response to airway epithelial cells in our in vitro model and (b) strain background and time spent in the tissue culture media have a greater impact on the transcriptome than the presence of host cells. Our analyses reveal both common and strain-specific transcriptional programmes that allow for the generation of hypotheses about gene function as it pertains to pathogenesis and the significant phenotypic heterogeneity that is observed among A. fumigatus isolates.","642":"The yeast Kluyveromyces marxianus possesses advantageous traits like rapid growth, GRAS (generally regarded as safe) status and thermotolerance that make it very suitable for diverse biotechnological applications. Although physiological studies demonstrate wide phenotypic variation within the species, there is only limited information available on the genetic diversity of K. marxianus. The aim of this work was to develop a multilocus sequence typing (MLST) method for K. marxianus to improve strain classification and selection. Analysis of housekeeping genes in a number of sequenced strains led to the selection of five genes, IPP1, TFC1, GPH1, GSY2 and SGA1, with sufficient polymorphic sites to allow MLST analysis. These loci were sequenced in an additional 76 strains and used to develop the MLST. This revealed wide diversity in the species and separation of the culture collection and wild strains into multiple distinct clades. Two subsets of strains that shared sources of origin were subjected to MLST and split decomposition analysis. The latter revealed evidence of recombination, indicating that this yeast undergoes mating in the wild. A public access web-based portal was established to allow expansion of the database and application of MLST to additional K. marxianus strains. This will aid understanding of the genetic diversity of the yeast and facilitate biotechnological exploitation.","643":null,"644":null,"645":"MLST (multi-locus sequence typing) is a classic technique for genotyping bacteria, widely applied for pathogen outbreak surveillance.

Such large-scale MLST schemes have been shown to provide a finer resolution and are increasingly used in various contexts such as hospital outbreaks or foodborne pathogen outbreaks. This methodological shift raises new computational challenges, especially given the large size of the schemes involved.

Chlamydiae are one such group of obligate intracellular microbes whose characterization has been hampered by this requirement. To circumvent these challenges, researchers have developed culture-independent sample preparation methods that can be applied to the sample directly or to genomic material extracted from the sample. These methods, which encompass both targeted [immunomagnetic separation-multiple displacement amplification (IMS-MDA) and sequence capture] and non-targeted approaches (host methylated DNA depletion-microbial DNA enrichment and cell-sorting-MDA), have been applied to a range of clinical and environmental samples to generate whole genomes of novel chlamydial species and strains.

Here, we isolated 12 novel species of the genus Leptospira from tropical soils, significantly increasing the number of known species to 35 and finding evidence of highly unexplored biodiversity in the genus. Extended comparative phylogenomics and pan-genome analyses at the genus level by incorporating 26 novel genomes, revealed that, the traditional leptospiral 'pathogens' cluster, as defined by their phylogenetic position, can be split in two groups with distinct virulence potential and accessory gene patterns. These genomic distinctions are strongly linked to the ability to cause or not severe infections in animal models and humans. Our results not only provide new insights into virulence evolution in the members of the genus Leptospira, but also lay the foundations for refining the classification of the pathogenic species.","651":"Cholera is a severe, water-borne diarrhoeal disease caused by toxin-producing strains of the bacterium Vibrio cholerae. Comparative genomics has revealed 'waves' of cholera transmission and evolution, in which clones are successively replaced over decades and centuries. However, the extent of V. cholerae genetic diversity within an epidemic or even within an individual patient is poorly understood. Here, we characterized V. cholerae genomic diversity at a micro-epidemiological level within and between individual patients from Bangladesh and Haiti. To capture within-patient diversity, we isolated multiple (8 to 20) V. cholerae colonies from each of eight patients, sequenced their genomes and identified point mutations and gene gain\/loss events. We found limited but detectable diversity at the level of point mutations within hosts (zero to three single nucleotide variants within each patient), and comparatively higher gene content variation within hosts (at least one gain\/loss event per patient, and up to 103 events in one patient). Much of the gene content variation appeared to be due to gain and loss of phage and plasmids within the V. cholerae population, with occasional exchanges between V. cholerae and other members of the gut microbiota. We also show that certain intra-host variants have phenotypic consequences. For example, the acquisition of a Bacteroides plasmid and non-synonymous mutations in a sensor histidine kinase gene both reduced biofilm formation, an important trait for environmental survival. Together, our results show that V. cholerae is measurably evolving within patients, with possible implications for disease outcomes and transmission dynamics.","652":null,"653":null,"654":null,"655":null,"656":"Most Staphylococcus aureus isolates can cause invasive disease given the right circumstances, but it is unknown if some isolates are more likely to cause severe infections than others.

These lineages can be differentiated by CRISPR cluster arrays, and we show that the lineages are limited with respect to inter-lineage genetic exchange. This restriction of genetic exchange maintains the discrete lineage structure in the population despite co-existence of lineages for thousands of years in multiple countries. Our data highlights how CRISPR can be informative of the evolutionary trajectory of bacterial lineages, and merits further study across bacteria.","661":"Illumina sequencing platforms have enabled widespread bacterial whole genome sequencing. While Illumina data is appropriate for many analyses, its short read length limits its ability to resolve genomic structure. This has major implications for tracking the spread of mobile genetic elements, including those which carry antimicrobial resistance determinants. Fully resolving a bacterial genome requires long-read sequencing such as those generated by Oxford Nanopore Technologies (ONT) platforms. Here we describe our use of the ONT MinION to sequence 12 isolates of Klebsiella pneumoniae on a single flow cell. We assembled each genome using a combination of ONT reads and previously available Illumina reads, and little to no manual intervention was needed to achieve fully resolved assemblies using the Unicycler hybrid assembler. Assembling only ONT reads with Canu was less effective, resulting in fewer resolved genomes and higher error rates even following error correction with Nanopolish. We demonstrate that multiplexed ONT sequencing is a valuable tool for high-throughput bacterial genome finishing. Specifically, we advocate the use of Illumina sequencing as a first analysis step, followed by ONT reads as needed to resolve genomic structure.","662":"Antimicrobial resistance (AMR) is one of the major threats to human and animal health worldwide, yet few high-throughput tools exist to analyse and predict the resistance of a bacterial isolate from sequencing data. Here we present a new tool, ARIBA, that identifies AMR-associated genes and single nucleotide polymorphisms directly from short reads, and generates detailed and customizable output. The accuracy and advantages of ARIBA over other tools are demonstrated on three datasets from Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria, with ARIBA outperforming existing methods.","663":"Pseudomonas aeruginosa is a ubiquitous opportunistic pathogen with several clones being frequently associated with outbreaks in hospital settings. ST395 is among these so-called 'international' clones. We aimed here to define the biological features that could have helped the implantation and spread of the clone ST395 in hospital settings. The complete genome of a multidrug resistant index isolate (DHS01) of a large hospital outbreak was analysed. We identified DHS01-specific genetic elements, among which were identified those shared with a panel of six independent ST395 isolates responsible for outbreaks in other hospitals. DHS01 has the fifth largest chromosome of the species (7.1 Mbp), with most of its 1555 accessory genes borne by either genomic islands (GIs, n=48) or integrative and conjugative elements (ICEs, n=5). DHS01 is multidrug resistant mostly due to chromosomal mutations. It displayed signatures of adaptation to chronic infection in part due to the loss of a 131 kbp chromosomal fragment. Four GIs were specific to the clone ST395 and contained genes involved in metabolism (GI-4), in virulence (GI-6) and in resistance to copper (GI-7). GI-7 harboured an array of six copper transporters and was shared with non-pathogenic Pseudomonas sp. retrieved from copper-contaminated environments. Copper resistance was confirmed phenotypically in all other ST395 isolates and possibly accounted for the spreading capability of the clone in hospital outbreaks, where water networks have been incriminated. This suggests that genes transferred from copper-polluted environments may have favoured the implantation and spread of the international clone P. aeruginosa ST395 in hospital settings.","664":null,"665":"We have investigated the connection between the four-dimensional architecture of the bacterial nucleoid and the organism's global gene expression programme. By localizing the transcription machinery and the transcriptional outputs across the genome of the model bacterium Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimurium at different stages of the growth cycle, a surprising disconnection between gene dosage and transcriptional output was revealed. During exponential growth, gene output occurred chiefly in the Ori (origin), Ter (terminus) and NSL (non-structured left) domains, whereas the Left macrodomain remained transcriptionally quiescent at all stages of growth. The apparently high transcriptional output in Ter was correlated with an enhanced stability of the RNA expressed there during exponential growth, suggesting that longer mRNA half-lives compensate for low gene dosage. During exponential growth, RNA polymerase (RNAP) was detected everywhere, whereas in stationary phase cells, RNAP was concentrated in the Ter macrodomain. The alternative sigma factors RpoE, RpoH and RpoN were not required to drive transcription in these growth conditions, consistent with their observed binding to regions away from RNAP and regions of active transcription. Specifically, these alternative sigma factors were found in the Ter macrodomain during exponential growth, whereas they were localized at the Ori macrodomain in stationary phase.","666":null,"667":null,"668":null,"669":null,"670":"Enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) is a major cause of diarrhoea in children below 5 years of age in endemic areas, and is a primary cause of diarrhoea in travellers visiting developing countries. Epidemiological analysis of E. coli pathovars is traditionally carried out based on the results of serotyping. However, genomic analysis of a global ETEC collection of 362 isolates taken from patients revealed nine novel O-antigen biosynthesis gene clusters that were previously unrecognized, and have collectively been called unclassified. When put in the context of all isolates sequenced, one of the novel O-genotypes, OgN5, was found to be the second most common ETEC O-genotype causing disease, after O6, in a globally representative ETEC collection. It's also clear that ETEC OgN5 isolates have spread globally. These novel O-genotypes have now been included in our comprehensive O-genotyping scheme, and can be detected using a PCR-based and an in silico typing method. This will assist in epidemiological studies, as well as in ETEC vaccine development.","671":"Multi-locus sequence typing (MLST) is a widely used method for categorizing bacteria. Increasingly, MLST is being performed using next-generation sequencing (NGS) data by reference laboratories and for clinical diagnostics. Many software applications have been developed to calculate sequence types from NGS data; however, there has been no comprehensive review to date on these methods. We have compared eight of these applications against real and simulated data, and present results on: (1) the accuracy of each method against traditional typing methods, (2) the performance on real outbreak datasets, (3) the impact of contamination and varying depth of coverage, and (4) the computational resource requirements.","672":"Countries of the African 'meningitis belt' are susceptible to meningococcal meningitis outbreaks. While in the past major epidemics have been primarily caused by serogroup A meningococci, W strains are currently responsible for most of the cases. After an epidemic in Mecca in 2000, W:ST-11 strains have caused many outbreaks worldwide. An unrelated W:ST-2881 clone was described for the first time in 2002, with the first meningitis cases caused by these bacteria reported in 2003. Here we describe results of a comparative whole-genome analysis of 74 W:ST-2881 strains isolated within the framework of two longitudinal colonization and disease studies conducted in Ghana and Burkina Faso. Genomic data indicate that the W:ST-2881 clone has emerged from Y:ST-175(CC175) bacteria by capsule switching. The circulating W:ST-2881 populations were composed of a variety of closely related but distinct genomic variants with no systematic differences between colonization and disease isolates. Two distinct and geographically clustered phylogenetic clonal variants were identified in Burkina Faso and a third in Ghana. On the basis of the presence or absence of 17 recombination fragments, the Ghanaian variant could be differentiated into five clusters. All 25 Ghanaian disease isolates clustered together with 23 out of 40 Ghanaian isolates associated with carriage within one cluster, indicating that W:ST-2881 clusters differ in virulence. More than half of the genes affected by horizontal gene transfer encoded proteins of the 'cell envelope' and the 'transport\/binding protein' categories, which indicates that exchange of non-capsular antigens plays an important role in immune evasion.","673":null,"674":"Melioidosis is a tropical disease caused by the bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei. Outbreaks are uncommon and can generally be attributed to a single point source and strain. We used whole-genome sequencing to analyse B. pseudomallei isolates collected from an historical 2-year long case cluster that occurred in a remote northern Australian indigenous island community, where infections were previously linked to a contaminated communal water supply. We analysed the genome-wide relatedness of the two most common multilocus sequence types (STs) involved in the outbreak, STs 125 and 126. This analysis showed that although these STs were closely related on a whole-genome level, they demonstrated evidence of multiple recombination events that were unlikely to have occurred over the timeframe of the outbreak. Based on epidemiological and genetic data, we also identified two additional patients not previously associated with this outbreak. Our results confirm the previous hypothesis that a single unchlorinated water source harbouring multiple B. pseudomallei strains was linked to the outbreak, and that increased melioidosis risk in this community was associated with Piper methysticum root (kava) consumption.","675":"The genus Lactobacillus is a diverse group with a combined species count of over 200. They are the largest group within the lactic acid bacteria and one of the most important bacterial groups involved in food microbiology and human nutrition because of their fermentative and probiotic properties. Lactobacillus salivarius, a species commonly isolated from the gastrointestinal tract of humans and animals, has been described as having potential probiotic properties and results of previous studies have revealed considerable functional diversity existing on both the chromosomes and plasmids. Our study consists of comparative genomic analyses of the functional and phylogenomic diversity of 42 genomes of strains of L. salivarius using bioinformatic techniques. The main aim of the study was to describe intra-species diversity and to determine how this diversity is spread across the replicons. We found that multiple phylogenomic and non-phylogenomic methods used for reconstructing trees all converge on similar tree topologies, showing that different metrics largely agree on the evolutionary history of the species. The greatest genomic variation lies on the small plasmids, followed by the repA-type circular megaplasmid, with the chromosome varying least of all. Additionally, the presence of extra linear and circular megaplasmids is noted in several strains, while small plasmids are not always present. Glycosyl hydrolases, bacteriocins and proteases vary considerably on all replicons while two exopolysaccharide clusters and several clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats-associated systems show a lot of variation on the chromosome. Overall, despite its reputation as a mammalian gastrointestinal tract specialist, the intra-specific variation of L. salivarius reveals potential strain-dependant effects on human health.","676":null,"677":"Antibiotic resistance forms a serious threat to the health of hospitalised patients, rendering otherwise treatable bacterial infections potentially life-threatening. A thorough understanding of the mechanisms by which resistance spreads between patients in different hospitals is required in order to design effective control strategies. We measured the differences between bacterial populations of 52 hospitals in the United Kingdom and Ireland, using whole-genome sequences from 1085 MRSA clonal complex 22 isolates collected between 1998 and 2012. The genetic differences between bacterial populations were compared with the number of patients transferred between hospitals and their regional structure. The MRSA populations within single hospitals, regions and countries were genetically distinct from the rest of the bacterial population at each of these levels. Hospitals from the same patient referral regions showed more similar MRSA populations, as did hospitals sharing many patients. Furthermore, the bacterial populations from different time-periods within the same hospital were generally more similar to each other than contemporaneous bacterial populations from different hospitals. We conclude that, while a large part of the dispersal and expansion of MRSA takes place among patients seeking care in single hospitals, inter-hospital spread of resistant bacteria is by no means a rare occurrence. Hospitals are exposed to constant introductions of MRSA on a number of levels: (1) most MRSA is received from hospitals that directly transfer large numbers of patients, while (2) fewer introductions happen between regions or (3) across national borders, reflecting lower numbers of transferred patients. A joint coordinated control effort between hospitals, is therefore paramount for the national control of MRSA, antibiotic-resistant bacteria and other hospital-associated pathogens.","678":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1099\/mgen.0.000064.].","679":null,"680":"The recent widespread application of whole-genome sequencing (WGS) for microbial disease investigations has spurred the development of new bioinformatics tools, including a notable proliferation of phylogenomics pipelines designed for infectious disease surveillance and outbreak investigation. Transitioning the use of WGS data out of the research laboratory and into the front lines of surveillance and outbreak response requires user-friendly, reproducible and scalable pipelines that have been well validated. Single Nucleotide Variant Phylogenomics (SNVPhyl) is a bioinformatics pipeline for identifying high-quality single-nucleotide variants (SNVs) and constructing a whole-genome phylogeny from a collection of WGS reads and a reference genome. Individual pipeline components are integrated into the Galaxy bioinformatics framework, enabling data analysis in a user-friendly, reproducible and scalable environment. We show that SNVPhyl can detect SNVs with high sensitivity and specificity, and identify and remove regions of high SNV density (indicative of recombination). SNVPhyl is able to correctly distinguish outbreak from non-outbreak isolates across a range of variant-calling settings, sequencing-coverage thresholds or in the presence of contamination. SNVPhyl is available as a Galaxy workflow, Docker and virtual machine images, and a Unix-based command-line application. SNVPhyl is released under the Apache 2.0 license and available at http:\/\/snvphyl.readthedocs.io\/ or at https:\/\/github.com\/phac-nml\/snvphyl-galaxy.","681":"An epidemic of post-surgical wound infections, caused by a non-tuberculous mycobacterium, has been on-going in Brazil. It has been unclear whether one or multiple lineages are responsible and whether their wide geographical distribution across Brazil is due to spread from a single point source or is the result of human-mediated transmission. 188 isolates, collected from nine Brazilian states, were whole genome sequenced and analysed using phylogenetic and comparative genomic approaches. The isolates from Brazil formed a single clade, which was estimated to have emerged in 2003. We observed temporal and geographic structure within the lineage that enabled us to infer the movement of sub-lineages across Brazil. The genome size of the Brazilian lineage was reduced relative to most strains in the three subspecies of Mycobacterium abscessus and contained a novel plasmid, pMAB02, in addition to the previously described pMAB01 plasmid. One lineage, which emerged just prior to the initial outbreak, is responsible for the epidemic of post-surgical wound infections in Brazil. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that multiple transmission events led to its spread. The presence of a novel plasmid and the reduced genome size suggest that the lineage has undergone adaptation to the surgical niche.","682":"A short while ago, the human genome and microbiome were analysed simultaneously for the first time as a multi-omic approach. The analyses of heterogeneous population cohorts showed that microbiome components were associated with human genome variations. In-depth analysis of these results reveals that the majority of those relationships are between immune pathways and autoimmune disease-associated microbiome components. Thus, it can be hypothesized that autoimmunity may be associated with homeostatic disequilibrium of the human-microbiome interactome. Further analysis of human genome-human microbiome relationships in disease contexts with tailored systems biology approaches may yield insights into disease pathogenesis and prognosis.","683":"The global spread of Klebsiella pneumoniae producing Klebsiella pneumoniae carbapenemase (KPC) has been mainly associated with the dissemination of high-risk clones. In the last decade, hospital outbreaks involving KPC-producing K. pneumoniae have been predominantly attributed to isolates belonging to clonal group (CG) 258. However, results of recent epidemiological analysis indicate that KPC-producing sequence type (ST) 307, is emerging in different parts of the world and is a candidate to become a prevalent high-risk clone in the near future. Here we show that the ST307 genome encodes genetic features that may provide an advantage in adaptation to the hospital environment and the human host. Sequence analysis revealed novel plasmid-located virulence factors, including a cluster for glycogen synthesis. Glycogen production is considered to be one of the possible adaptive responses to long-term survival and growth in environments outside the host. Chromosomally-encoded virulence traits in the clone comprised fimbriae, an integrative conjugative element carrying the yersiniabactin siderophore, and two different capsular loci. Compared with the ST258 clone, capsulated ST307 isolates showed higher resistance to complement-mediated killing. The acquired genetic features identified in the genome of this new emerging clone may contribute to increased persistence of ST307 in the hospital environment and shed light on its potential epidemiological success.","684":"The emergence of antibiotic resistance is a defining challenge, and Escherichia coli is recognized as one of the leading species resistant to the antimicrobials used in human or veterinary medicine. Here, we analyse the distribution of 2172 antimicrobial-resistance (AMR) genes in 4022 E. coli to provide a population-level view of resistance in this species. By separating the resistance determinants into 'core' (those found in all strains) and 'accessory' (those variably present) determinants, we have found that, surprisingly, almost half of all E. coli do not encode any accessory resistance determinants. However, those strains that do encode accessory resistance are significantly more likely to be resistant to multiple antibiotic classes than would be expected by chance. Furthermore, by studying the available date of isolation for the E. coli genomes, we have visualized an expanding, highly interconnected network that describes how resistances to antimicrobials have co-associated within genomes over time. These data can be exploited to reveal antimicrobial combinations that are less likely to be found together, and so if used in combination may present an increased chance of suppressing the growth of bacteria and reduce the rate at which resistance factors are spread. Our study provides a complex picture of AMR in the E. coli population. Although the incidence of resistance to all studied antibiotic classes has increased dramatically over time, there exist combinations of antibiotics that could, in theory, attack the entirety of E. coli, effectively removing the possibility that discrete AMR genes will increase in frequency in the population.","685":null,"686":"The increasing availability and decreasing cost of high-throughput sequencing has transformed academic medical microbiology, delivering an explosion in available genomes while also driving advances in bioinformatics. However, many microbiologists are unable to exploit the resulting large genomics datasets because they do not have access to relevant computational resources and to an appropriate bioinformatics infrastructure. Here, we present the Cloud Infrastructure for Microbial Bioinformatics (CLIMB) facility, a shared computing infrastructure that has been designed from the ground up to provide an environment where microbiologists can share and reuse methods and data.","687":"Existing metagenome datasets from many different environments contain untapped potential for understanding metabolic pathways and their biological impact. Our interest lies in the formation of trimethylamine (TMA), a key metabolite in both human health and climate change. Here, we focus on bacterial degradation pathways for choline, carnitine, glycine betaine and trimethylamine N-oxide (TMAO) to TMA in human gut and marine metagenomes. We found the TMAO reductase pathway was the most prevalent pathway in both environments. Proteobacteria were found to contribute the majority of the TMAO reductase pathway sequences, except in the stressed gut, where Actinobacteria dominated. Interestingly, in the human gut metagenomes, a high proportion of the Proteobacteria hits were accounted for by the genera Klebsiella and Escherichia. Furthermore Klebsiella and Escherichia harboured three of the four potential TMA-production pathways (choline, carnitine and TMAO), suggesting they have a key role in TMA cycling in the human gut. In addition to the intensive TMAO-TMA cycling in the marine environment, our data suggest that carnitine-to-TMA transformation plays an overlooked role in aerobic marine surface waters, whereas choline-to-TMA transformation is important in anaerobic marine sediments. Our study provides new insights into the potential key microbes and metabolic pathways for TMA formation in two contrasting environments.","688":"Staphylococcus epidermidis is a significant opportunistic pathogen of humans. The ST2 lineage is frequently multidrug-resistant and accounts for most of the clinical disease worldwide. However, there are no publically available, closed ST2 genomes and pathogenesis studies have not focused on these strains. We report the complete genome and methylome of BPH0662, a multidrug-resistant, hospital-adapted, ST2 S. epidermidis, and describe the correlation between resistome and phenotype, as well as demonstrate its relationship to publically available, international ST2 isolates. Furthermore, we delineate the methylome determined by the two type I restriction modification systems present in BPH0662 through heterologous expression in Escherichia coli, allowing the assignment of each system to its corresponding target recognition motif. As the first, to our knowledge, complete ST2 S. epidermidis genome, BPH0662 provides a valuable reference for future genomic studies of this clinically relevant lineage. Defining the methylome and the construction of these E. coli hosts provides the foundation for the development of molecular tools to bypass restriction modification systems in this lineage that has hitherto proven intractable.","689":null,"690":null,"691":"[This corrects the article DOI: 10.1099\/mgen.0.000059.].","692":"The Streptococcus mutans Cid\/Lrg system is central to the physiology of this cariogenic organism, affecting oxidative stress resistance, biofilm formation and competence. Previous transcriptome analyses of lytS (responsible for the regulation of lrgAB expression) and cidB mutants have revealed pleiotropic effects on carbohydrate metabolism and stress resistance genes. In this study, it was found that an lrgAB mutant, previously shown to have diminished aerobic and oxidative stress growth, was also much more growth impaired in the presence of heat and vancomycin stresses, relative to wild-type, lrgA and lrgB mutants. To obtain a more holistic picture of LrgAB and its involvement in stress resistance, RNA sequencing and bioinformatics analyses were used to assess the transcriptional response of wild-type and isogenic lrgAB mutants under anaerobic (control) and stress-inducing culture conditions (aerobic, heat and vancomycin). Hierarchical clustering and principal components analyses of all differentially expressed genes revealed that the most distinct gene expression profiles between S. mutans UA159 and lrgAB mutant occurred during aerobic and high-temperature growth. Similar to previous studies of a cidB mutant, lrgAB stress transcriptomes were characterized by a variety of gene expression changes related to genomic islands, CRISPR-C as systems, ABC transporters, competence, bacteriocins, glucosyltransferases, protein translation, tricarboxylic acid cycle, carbohydrate metabolism\/storage and transport. Notably, expression of lrgAB was upregulated in the wild-type strain under all three stress conditions. Collectively, these results demonstrate that mutation of lrgAB alters the transcriptional response to stress, and further support the idea that the Cid\/Lrg system acts to promote cell homeostasis in the face of environmental stress.","693":"Fungi interact closely with bacteria, both on the surfaces of the hyphae and within their living tissues (i.e. endohyphal bacteria, EHB). These EHB can be obligate or facultative symbionts and can mediate diverse phenotypic traits in their hosts. Although EHB have been observed in many lineages of fungi, it remains unclear how widespread and general these associations are, and whether there are unifying ecological and genomic features can be found across EHB strains as a whole. We cultured 11 bacterial strains after they emerged from the hyphae of diverse Ascomycota that were isolated as foliar endophytes of cupressaceous trees, and generated nearly complete genome sequences for all. Unlike the genomes of largely obligate EHB, the genomes of these facultative EHB resembled those of closely related strains isolated from environmental sources. Although all analysed genomes encoded structures that could be used to interact with eukaryotic hosts, pathways previously implicated in maintenance and establishment of EHB symbiosis were not universally present across all strains. Independent isolation of two nearly identical pairs of strains from different classes of fungi, coupled with recent experimental evidence, suggests horizontal transfer of EHB across endophytic hosts. Given the potential for EHB to influence fungal phenotypes, these genomes could shed light on the mechanisms of plant growth promotion or stress mitigation by fungal endophytes during the symbiotic phase, as well as degradation of plant material during the saprotrophic phase. As such, these findings contribute to the illumination of a new dimension of functional biodiversity in fungi.","694":"Distinct clones of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) have emerged as important causes of infection in individuals who have exposure to livestock (livestock-associated MRSA; LA-MRSA). Clonal complex 398 (CC398) is the most prevalent LA-MRSA clone, and has been reported from several geographical settings, including Europe, the Americas and Asia. To understand the factors contributing to the global dissemination of this clone, we analysed CC398 MRSA isolates from New Zealand (NZ), a geographically isolated country with an economy strongly dependent on livestock farming. We supplemented the NZ CC398 MRSA collection with global datasets of CC398 MRSA and CC398 methicillin-susceptible S. aureus. Here, we demonstrate multiple sporadic incursions of CC398 MRSA into NZ, as well as recent importation and spread of a swine-associated clade related to the European LA-MRSA lineage. Within a larger global phylogenomic framework, Bayesian modelling suggested that this NZ clade emerged in the late 2000s, with a probable origin in swine from Western Europe. Elucidating the factors responsible for the incursion and spread of LA-MRSA in geographically distant regions, such as NZ, provides important insights into global pathways of S. aureus transmission, and will inform strategies to control importation and spread.","695":"Recent studies have provided evidence for rapid pathogen genome diversification, some of which could potentially affect the course of disease. We have previously described such variation seen between isolates infecting the blood and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) of a single patient during a case of bacterial meningitis. Here, we performed whole-genome sequencing of paired isolates from the blood and CSF of 869 meningitis patients to determine whether such variation frequently occurs between these two niches in cases of bacterial meningitis. Using a combination of reference-free variant calling approaches, we show that no genetic adaptation occurs in either invaded niche during bacterial meningitis for two major pathogen species, Streptococcus pneumoniae and Neisseria meningitidis. This study therefore shows that the bacteria capable of causing meningitis are already able to do this upon entering the blood, and no further sequence change is necessary to cross the blood-brain barrier. Our findings place the focus back on bacterial evolution between nasopharyngeal carriage and invasion, or diversity of the host, as likely mechanisms for determining invasiveness.","696":null,"697":"Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC) O157:H7 is a public health threat and outbreaks occur worldwide. Here, we investigate genomic differences between related STEC O157:H7 that caused two outbreaks, eight weeks apart, at the same restaurant. Short-read genome sequencing divided the outbreak strains into two sub-clusters separated by only three single-nucleotide polymorphisms in the core genome while traditional typing identified them as separate phage types, PT8 and PT54. Isolates did not cluster with local strains but with those associated with foreign travel to the Middle East\/North Africa. Combined long-read sequencing approaches and optical mapping revealed that the two outbreak strains had undergone significant microevolution in the accessory genome with prophage gain, loss and recombination. In addition, the PT54 sub-type had acquired a 240 kbp multi-drug resistance (MDR) IncHI2 plasmid responsible for the phage type switch. A PT54 isolate had a general fitness advantage over a PT8 isolate in rich medium, including an increased capacity to use specific amino acids and dipeptides as a nitrogen source. The second outbreak was considerably larger and there were multiple secondary cases indicative of effective human-to-human transmission. We speculate that MDR plasmid acquisition and prophage changes have adapted the PT54 strain for human infection and transmission. Our study shows the added insights provided by combining whole-genome sequencing approaches for outbreak investigations.","698":null,"699":"In this study we compared the NS1 protein of Influenza B\/Lee\/40 and several non-cultured Influenza B virus clinical strains detected in Singapore. In B\/Lee\/40 virus-infected cells and in cells expressing the recombinant B\/Lee\/40 NS1 protein a full-length 35 kDa NS1 protein and a 23 kDa NS1 protein species (p23) were detected. Mutational analysis of the NS1 gene indicated that p23 was generated by a novel cleavage event within the linker domain between an aspartic acid and proline at amino acid residues at positions 92 and 93 respectively (DP92-93), and that p23 contained the first 92 amino acids of the NS1 protein. Sequence analysis of the Singapore strains indicated the presence of either DP92-93 or NP92-93 in the NS1 protein, but protein expression analysis showed that p23 was only detected in NS1 proteins with DP92-93.. An additional adjacent proline residue at position 94 (P94) was present in some strains and correlated with increased p23 levels, suggesting that P94 has a synergistic effect on the cleavage of the NS1 protein. The first 145 amino acids of the NS1 protein are required for inhibition of ISG15-mediated ubiquitination, and our analysis showed that Influenza B viruses circulating in Singapore with DP92-93 expressed truncated NS1 proteins and may differ in their capacity to inhibit ISG15 activity. Thus, DP92-93 in the NS1 protein may confer a disadvantage to Influenza B viruses circulating in the human population and interestingly the low frequency of DP92-93detection in the NS1 protein since 2004 is consistent with this suggestion.","700":"There are many types of repeated DNA sequences in the genomes of the species of the genus Neisseria, from homopolymeric tracts to tandem repeats of hundreds of bases. Some of these have roles in the phase-variable expression of genes. When a repeat mediates phase variation, reversible switching between tract lengths occurs, which in the species of the genus Neisseria most often causes the gene to switch between on and off states through frame shifting of the open reading frame. Changes in repeat tract lengths may also influence the strength of transcription from a promoter. For phenotypes that can be readily observed, such as expression of the surface-expressed Opa proteins or pili, verification that repeats are mediating phase variation is relatively straightforward. For other genes, particularly those where the function has not been identified, gathering evidence of repeat tract changes can be more difficult. Here we present analysis of the repetitive sequences that could mediate phase variation in the Neisseria gonorrhoeae strain NCCP11945 genome sequence and compare these results with other gonococcal genome sequences. Evidence is presented for an updated phase-variable gene repertoire in this species, including a class of phase variation that causes amino acid changes at the C-terminus of the protein, not previously described in N. gonorrhoeae.","701":"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) provides the highest resolution analysis for comparison of bacterial isolates in public health microbiology. However, although increasingly being used routinely for some pathogens such as Listeria monocytogenes and Salmonella enterica, the use of WGS is still limited for other organisms, such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Multi-antigen sequence typing (NG-MAST) is the most widely performed typing method for epidemiological surveillance of gonorrhoea. Here, we present NGMASTER, a command-line software tool for performing in silico NG-MAST on assembled genome data. NGMASTER rapidly and accurately determined the NG-MAST of 630 assembled genomes, facilitating comparisons between WGS and previously published gonorrhoea epidemiological studies.

For several applications it is important to accurately identify the presence and estimate relative abundances of the target organisms from short sequence reads obtained from a sample. This task is particularly challenging when the set of interest includes very closely related organisms, such as different strains of pathogenic bacteria, which can vary considerably in terms of virulence, resistance and spread. Using advanced Bayesian statistical modelling and computation techniques we introduce a novel pipeline for bacterial identification that is shown to outperform the currently leading pipeline for this purpose. Our approach enables fast and accurate sequence-based identification of bacterial strains while using only modest computational resources. Hence it provides a useful tool for a wide spectrum of applications, including rapid clinical diagnostics to distinguish among closely related strains causing nosocomial infections. The software implementation is available at https:\/\/github.com\/PROBIC\/BIB.","703":"Whole-genome sequencing (WGS) of bacterial isolates has become standard practice in many laboratories. Applications for WGS analysis include phylogeography and molecular epidemiology, using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) as the unit of evolution. NASP was developed as a reproducible method that scales well with the hundreds to thousands of WGS data typically used in comparative genomics applications. In this study, we demonstrate how NASP compares with other tools in the analysis of two real bacterial genomics datasets and one simulated dataset. Our results demonstrate that NASP produces similar, and often better, results in comparison with other pipelines, but is much more flexible in terms of data input types, job management systems, diversity of supported tools and output formats. We also demonstrate differences in results based on the choice of the reference genome and choice of inferring phylogenies from concatenated SNPs or alignments including monomorphic positions. NASP represents a source-available, version-controlled, unit-tested method and can be obtained from tgennorth.github.io\/NASP.","704":"Klebsiella pneumoniae is considered an urgent health concern due to the emergence of multi-drug-resistant strains for which vaccination offers a potential remedy. Vaccines based on surface polysaccharides are highly promising but need to address the high diversity of surface-exposed polysaccharides, synthesized as O-antigens (lipopolysaccharide, LPS) and K-antigens (capsule polysaccharide, CPS), present in K. pneumoniae. We present a comprehensive and clinically relevant study of the diversity of O- and K-antigen biosynthesis gene clusters across a global collection of over 500 K. pneumoniae whole-genome sequences and the seroepidemiology of human isolates from different infection types. Our study defines the genetic diversity of O- and K-antigen biosynthesis cluster sequences across this collection, identifying sequences for known serotypes as well as identifying novel LPS and CPS gene clusters found in circulating contemporary isolates. Serotypes O1, O2 and O3 were most prevalent in our sample set, accounting for approximately 80 % of all infections. In contrast, K serotypes showed an order of magnitude higher diversity and differ among infection types. In addition we investigated a potential association of O or K serotypes with phylogenetic lineage, infection type and the presence of known virulence genes. K1 and K2 serotypes, which are associated with hypervirulent K. pneumoniae, were associated with a higher abundance of virulence genes and more diverse O serotypes compared to other common K serotypes.","705":null,"706":null,"707":"Outbreaks of Salmonella Enteritidis have long been associated with contaminated poultry and eggs. In the summer of 2014 a large multi-national outbreak of Salmonella Enteritidis phage type 14b occurred with over 350 cases reported in the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, France and Luxembourg. Egg supply network investigation and microbiological sampling identified the source to be a Bavarian egg producer. As part of the international investigation into the outbreak, over 400 isolates were sequenced including isolates from cases, implicated UK premises and eggs from the suspected source producer. We were able to show a clear statistical correlation between the topology of the UK egg distribution network and the phylogenetic network of outbreak isolates. This correlation can most plausibly be explained by different parts of the egg distribution network being supplied by eggs solely from independent premises of the Bavarian egg producer (Company X). Microbiological sampling from the source premises, traceback information and information on the interventions carried out at the egg production premises all supported this conclusion. The level of insight into the outbreak epidemiology provided by whole-genome sequencing (WGS) would not have been possible using traditional microbial typing methods.","708":"DNA uptake sequences are widespread throughout the Neisseria gonorrhoeae genome. These short, conserved sequences facilitate the exchange of endogenous DNA between members of the genus Neisseria. Often the DNA uptake sequences are present as inverted repeats that are able to form hairpin structures. It has been suggested previously that DNA uptake sequence inverted repeats present 3' of genes play a role in rho-independent termination and attenuation. However, there is conflicting experimental evidence to support this role. The aim of this study was to determine the role of DNA uptake sequences in transcriptional termination. Both bioinformatics predictions, conducted using TransTermHP, and experimental evidence, from RNA-seq data, were used to determine which inverted repeat DNA uptake sequences are transcriptional terminators and in which direction. Here we show that DNA uptake sequences in the inverted repeat configuration occur in N. gonorrhoeae both where the DNA uptake sequence precedes the inverted version of the sequence and also, albeit less frequently, in reverse order. Due to their symmetrical configuration, inverted repeat DNA uptake sequences can potentially act as bi-directional terminators, therefore affecting transcription on both DNA strands. This work also provides evidence that gaps in DNA uptake sequence density in the gonococcal genome coincide with areas of DNA that are foreign in origin, such as prophage. This study differentiates for the first time, to our knowledge, between DNA uptake sequences that form intrinsic transcriptional terminators and those that do not, providing characteristic features within the flanking inverted repeat that can be identified.","709":"Q-fever is an underreported disease caused by the bacterium Coxiella burnetii, which is highly infectious and has the ability to disperse great distances. It is a completely clonal pathogen with low genetic diversity and requires whole-genome analysis to identify discriminating features among closely related isolates. C. burnetii, and in particular one genotype (ST20), is commonly found in cow's milk across the entire dairy industry of the USA. This single genotype dominance is suggestive of host-specific adaptation, rapid dispersal and persistence within cattle. We used a comparative genomic approach to identify SNPs for high-resolution and high-throughput genotyping assays to better describe the dispersal of ST20 across the USA. We genotyped 507 ST20 cow milk samples and discovered three subgenotypes, all of which were present across the entire country and over the complete time period studied. Only one of these sub-genotypes was observed in a single dairy herd. The temporal and geographic distribution of these sub-genotypes is consistent with a model of large-scale, rapid, frequent and continuous dissemination on a continental scale. The distribution of subgenotypes is not consistent with wind-based dispersal alone, and it is likely that animal husbandry and transportation practices, including pooling of milk from multiple herds, have also shaped the patterns. On the scale of an entire country, there appear to be few barriers to rapid, frequent and large-scale dissemination of the ST20 subgenotypes.","710":"Melioidosis, caused by the highly recombinogenic bacterium Burkholderia pseudomallei, is a disease with high mortality. Tracing the origin of melioidosis outbreaks and understanding how the bacterium spreads and persists in the environment are essential to protecting public and veterinary health and reducing mortality associated with outbreaks. We used whole-genome sequencing to compare isolates from a historical quarter-century outbreak that occurred between 1966 and 1991 in the Avon Valley, Western Australia, a region far outside the known range of B. pseudomallei endemicity. All Avon Valley outbreak isolates shared the same multilocus sequence type (ST-284), which has not been identified outside this region. We found substantial genetic diversity among isolates based on a comparison of genome-wide variants, with no clear correlation between genotypes and temporal, geographical or source data. We observed little evidence of recombination in the outbreak strains, indicating that genetic diversity among these isolates has primarily accrued by mutation. Phylogenomic analysis demonstrated that the isolates confidently grouped within the Australian B. pseudomallei clade, thereby ruling out introduction from a melioidosis-endemic region outside Australia. Collectively, our results point to B. pseudomallei ST-284 being present in the Avon Valley for longer than previously recognized, with its persistence and genomic diversity suggesting long-term, low-prevalence endemicity in this temperate region. Our findings provide a concerning demonstration of the potential for environmental persistence of B. pseudomallei far outside the conventional endemic regions. An expected increase in extreme weather events may reactivate latent B. pseudomallei populations in this region.","711":null,"712":"Next-generation sequencing technologies have dramatically increased the rate at which new genomes are sequenced. Accordingly, automated annotation programs have become adept at identifying and annotating protein coding regions, as well as common and conserved RNAs. Additionally, RNAseq techniques have advanced our ability to identify and annotate regulatory RNAs (sRNAs), which remain significantly understudied. Recently, our group catalogued and annotated all previously known and newly identified sRNAs in several Staphylococcus aureus strains. These complete annotation files now serve as tools to compare the sRNA content of S. aureus with other bacterial strains to investigate the conservation of their sRNomes. Accordingly, in this study we performed RNAseq on two staphylococcal species, Staphylococcus epidermidis and Staphylococcus carnosus, identifying 118 and 89 sRNAs in these organisms, respectively. The sRNA contents of all three species were then compared to elucidate their common and species-specific sRNA content, identifying a core set of between 53 and 36 sRNAs encoded in each organism. In addition, we determined that S. aureus has the largest set of unique sRNAs (137) while S. epidermidishas the fewest (25). Finally, we identify a highly conserved sequence and structural motif differentially represented within, yet common to, both S. aureus and S. epidermidis. Collectively, in this study, we uncover the sRNome common to three staphylococcal species, shedding light on sRNAs that are likely to be involved in basic physiological processes common to the genus. More significantly, we have identified species-specific sRNAs that are likely to influence the individual lifestyle and behaviour of these diverse staphylococcal strains.","713":"The lipopolysaccharide (O) and flagellar (H) surface antigens of Escherichia coli are targets for serotyping that have traditionally been used to identify pathogenic lineages. These surface antigens are important for the survival of E. coli within mammalian hosts. However, traditional serotyping has several limitations, and public health reference laboratories are increasingly moving towards whole genome sequencing (WGS) to characterize bacterial isolates. Here we present a method to rapidly and accurately serotype E. coli isolates from raw, short read WGS data. Our approach bypasses the need for de novo genome assembly by directly screening WGS reads against a curated database of alleles linked to known and novel E. coli O-groups and H-types (the EcOH database) using the software package srst2. We validated the approach by comparing in silico results for 197 enteropathogenic E. coli isolates with those obtained by serological phenotyping in an independent laboratory. We then demonstrated the utility of our method to characterize isolates in public health and clinical settings, and to explore the genetic diversity of &gt;1500 E. coli genomes from multiple sources. Importantly, we showed that transfer of O- and H-antigen loci between E. coli chromosomal backbones is common, with little evidence of constraints by host or pathotype, suggesting that E. coli 'strain space' may be virtually unlimited, even within specific pathotypes. Our findings show that serotyping is most useful when used in combination with strain genotyping to characterize microevolution events within an inferred population structure.","714":"Insertion sequence (IS) elements are important mediators of genome plasticity and can lead to phenotypic changes with evolutionary significance. In multidrug-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and Klebsiella pneumoniae, IS elements have contributed significantly to the mobilization of genes that encode resistance to antimicrobial drugs. A systematic analysis of IS elements is needed for a more comprehensive understanding of their evolutionary impact. We developed a computational approach (ISseeker) to annotate IS elements in draft genome assemblies and applied the method to analysis of IS elements in all publicly available A. baumannii(&gt;1000) and K. pneumoniae(&gt;800) genome sequences, in a phylogenetic context. Most IS elements in A. baumanniigenomes are species-specific ISAba elements, whereas K. pneumoniaegenomes contain significant numbers of both ISKpn elements and elements that are found throughout the Enterobacteriaceae. A. baumanniigenomes have a higher density of IS elements than K. pneumoniae, averaging ~33 vs ~27 copies per genome. In K. pneumoniae, several insertion sites are shared by most genomes in the ST258 clade, whereas in A. baumannii, different IS elements are abundant in different phylogenetic groups, even among closely related Global Clone 2 strains. IS elements differ in the distribution of insertion locations relative to genes, with some more likely to disrupt genes and others predominantly in intergenic regions. Several genes and intergenic regions had multiple independent insertion events, suggesting that those events may confer a selective advantage. Genome- and taxon-wide characterization of insertion locations revealed that IS elements have been active contributors to genome diversity in both species.","715":"Comparative genomics approaches are broadly used for analysis of transcriptional regulation in bacterial genomes. In this work, we identified binding sites and reconstructed regulons for 33 orthologous groups of transcription factors (TFs) in 196 reference genomes from 21 taxonomic groups of Proteobacteria. Overall, we predict over 10 600 TF binding sites and identified more than 15 600 target genes for 1896 TFs constituting the studied orthologous groups of regulators. These include a set of orthologues for 21 metabolism-associated TFs from Escherichia coli and\/or Shewanella that are conserved in five or more taxonomic groups and several additional TFs that represent non-orthologous substitutions of the metabolic regulators in some lineages of Proteobacteria. By comparing gene contents of the reconstructed regulons, we identified the core, taxonomy-specific and genome-specific TF regulon members and classified them by their metabolic functions. Detailed analysis of ArgR, TyrR, TrpR, HutC, HypR and other amino-acid-specific regulons demonstrated remarkable differences in regulatory strategies used by various lineages of Proteobacteria. The obtained genomic collection of in silico reconstructed TF regulons contains a large number of new regulatory interactions that await future experimental validation. The collection provides a framework for future evolutionary studies of transcriptional regulatory networks in Bacteria. It can be also used for functional annotation of putative metabolic transporters and enzymes that are abundant in the reconstructed regulons.","716":"Lineage 7 of the Mycobacterium tuberculosis complex has recently been identified among strains originating from Ethiopia. Using different DNA typing techniques, this study provides additional information on the genetic heterogeneity of five lineage 7 strains collected in the Amhara Region of Ethiopia. It also confirms the phylogenetic positioning of these strains between the ancient lineage 1 and TbD1-deleted, modern lineages 2, 3 and 4 of Mycobacterium tuberculosis. Four newly identified large sequence polymorphisms characteristic of the Amhara Region lineage 7 strains are described. While lineage 7 strains have been previously identified in the Woldiya area, we show that lineage 7 strains circulate in other parts of the Amhara Region and also among foreign-born individuals from Eritrea and Somalia in The Netherlands. For ease of documenting future identification of these strains in other geographical locations and recognizing the place of origin, we propose to assign lineage 7 strains the lineage name 'Aethiops vetus'.","717":"A sudden increase in invasive Group A Streptococcus (iGAS) infections associated with emm\/M3 isolates during the winter of 2008\/09 prompted the initiation of enhanced surveillance in England. In order to characterise the population of emm\/M3 GAS within the UK and determine bacterial factors that might be responsible for this upsurge, 442 emm\/M3 isolates from cases of invasive and non-invasive infections during the period 2001-2013 were subjected to whole genome sequencing. MLST analysis differentiated emm\/M3 isolates into three sequence types (STs): ST15, ST315 and ST406. Analysis of the whole genome SNP-based phylogeny showed that the majority of isolates from the 2008-2009 upsurge period belonged to a distinct lineage characterized by the presence of a prophage carrying the speC exotoxin and spd1 DNAase genes but loss of two other prophages considered typical of the emm\/M3 lineage. This lineage was significantly associated with the upsurge in iGAS cases and we postulate that the upsurge could be attributed in part to expansion of this novel prophage-containing lineage within the population. The study underlines the importance of prompt genomic analysis of changes in the GAS population, providing an advanced public health warning system for newly emergent, pathogenic strains.","718":"Phylodynamic reconstructions rely on a measurable molecular footprint of epidemic processes in pathogen genomes. Identifying the factors that govern the tempo and mode by which these processes leave a footprint in pathogen genomes represents an important goal towards understanding infectious disease evolution. Discriminating between synonymous and non-synonymous substitution rates is crucial for testing hypotheses about the sources of evolutionary rate variation. Here, we implement a codon substitution model in a Bayesian statistical framework to estimate absolute rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution in unknown evolutionary histories. To demonstrate how this model can provide critical insights into pathogen evolutionary dynamics, we adopt hierarchical phylogenetic modelling with fixed effects and apply it to two viral examples. Using within-host HIV-1 data from patients with different host genetic background and different disease progression rates, we show that viral populations undergo faster absolute synonymous substitution rates in patients with faster disease progression, probably reflecting faster replication rates. We also re-analyse rabies data from different bat species in the Americas to demonstrate that climate predicts absolute synonymous substitution rates, which can be attributed to climate-associated bat activity and viral transmission dynamics. In conclusion, our model to estimate absolute rates of synonymous and non-synonymous substitution can provide a powerful approach to investigate how host ecology can shape the tempo of pathogen evolution.","719":"We report an updated method for inferring the time at which an infectious disease was transmitted between persons from a time-labelled pathogen genome phylogeny. We applied the method to 48 Mycobacterium tuberculosis genomes as part of a real-time public health outbreak investigation, demonstrating that although active tuberculosis (TB) cases were diagnosed through 2013, no transmission events took place beyond mid-2012. Subsequent cases were the result of progression from latent TB infection to active disease, and not recent transmission. This evolutionary genomic approach was used to declare the outbreak over in January 2015.","720":null,"721":"Rapidly decreasing genome sequencing costs have led to a proportionate increase in the number of samples used in prokaryotic population studies. Extracting single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) from a large whole genome alignment is now a routine task, but existing tools have failed to scale efficiently with the increased size of studies. These tools are slow, memory inefficient and are installed through non-standard procedures. We present SNP-sites which can rapidly extract SNPs from a multi-FASTA alignment using modest resources and can output results in multiple formats for downstream analysis. SNPs can be extracted from a 8.3 GB alignment file (1842 taxa, 22 618 sites) in 267 seconds using 59 MB of RAM and 1 CPU core, making it feasible to run on modest computers. It is easy to install through the Debian and Homebrew package managers, and has been successfully tested on more than 20 operating systems. SNP-sites is implemented in C and is available under the open source license GNU GPL version 3.","722":"Renibacterium salmoninarum is the causative agent of bacterial kidney disease, an important disease of farmed and wild salmonid fish worldwide. Despite the wide spatiotemporal distribution of this disease and habitat pressures ranging from the natural environment to aquaculture and rivers to marine environments, little variation has been observed in the R. salmoninarum genome. Here we use the coverage depth from genomic sequencing corroborated by real-time quantitative PCR to detect copy number variation (CNV) among the genes of R. salmoninarum. CNV was primarily limited to the known dominant virulence factors msa and p22. Among 68 isolates representing the UK, Norway and North America, the msa gene ranged from two to five identical copies and the p22 gene ranged from one to five copies. CNV for these two genes co-occurred, suggesting they may be functionally linked. Isolates carrying CNV were phylogenetically restricted and originated predominantly from sites in North America, rather than the UK or Norway. Although both phylogenetic relationship and geographical origin were found to correlate with CNV status, geographical origin was a much stronger predictor than phylogeny, suggesting a role for local selection pressures in the repeated emergence and maintenance of this trait.","723":"","724":"Obtaining meaningful viral information from large sequencing datasets presents unique challenges distinct from prokaryotic and eukaryotic sequencing efforts. The difficulties surrounding this issue can be ascribed in part to the genomic plasticity of viruses themselves as well as the scarcity of existing information in genomic databases. The open-source software PhagePhisher (http:\/\/www.putonti-lab.com\/phagephisher) has been designed as a simple pipeline to extract relevant information from complex and mixed datasets, and will improve the examination of bacteriophages, viruses, and virally related sequences, in a range of environments. Key aspects of the software include speed and ease of use; PhagePhisher can be used with limited operator knowledge of bioinformatics on a standard workstation. As a proof-of-concept, PhagePhisher was successfully implemented with bacteria-virus mixed samples of varying complexity. Furthermore, viral signals within microbial metagenomic datasets were easily and quickly identified by PhagePhisher, including those from prophages as well as lysogenic phages, an important and often neglected aspect of examining phage populations in the environment. PhagePhisher resolves viral-related sequences which may be obscured by or imbedded in bacterial genomes.","725":"Chronic bacterial airway infections in people with cystic fibrosis (CF) are often caused by Pseudomonas aeruginosa, typically showing high phenotypic diversity amongst co-isolates from the same sputum sample. Whilst adaptive evolution during chronic infections has been reported, the genetic mechanisms underlying the observed rapid within-population diversification are not well understood. Two recent conflicting reports described very high and low rates of homologous recombination in two closely related P. aeruginosa populations from the lungs of different chronically infected CF patients. To investigate the underlying cause of these contrasting observations, we combined the short read datasets from both studies and applied a new comparative analysis. We inferred low rates of recombination in both populations. The discrepancy in the findings of the two previous studies can be explained by differences in the application of variant calling techniques. Two novel algorithms were developed that filter false-positive variants. The first algorithm filters variants on the basis of ambiguity within duplications in the reference genome. The second omits probable false-positive variants at regions of non-homology between reference and sample caused by structural rearrangements. As gains and losses of prophage or genomic islands are frequent causes of chromosomal rearrangements within microbial populations, this filter has broad appeal for mitigating false-positive variant calls. Both algorithms are available in a Python package.","726":"We recently reported a dramatic increase in the prevalence of carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii infections in the intensive care unit (ICU) of a Vietnamese hospital. This upsurge was associated with a specific oxa23-positive clone that was identified by multilocus VNTR analysis. Here, we used whole-genome sequence analysis to dissect the emergence of carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii causing ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP) in the ICU during 2009-2012. To provide historical context and distinguish microevolution from strain introduction, we compared these genomes with those of A. baumannii asymptomatic carriage and VAP isolates from this same ICU collected during 2003-2007. We identified diverse lineages co-circulating over many years. Carbapenem resistance was associated with the presence of oxa23, oxa40, oxa58 and ndm1 genes in multiple lineages. The majority of resistant isolates were oxa23-positive global clone GC2; fine-scale phylogenomic analysis revealed five distinct GC2 sublineages within the ICU that had evolved locally via independent chromosomal insertions of oxa23 transposons. The increase in infections caused by carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii was associated with transposon-mediated transmission of a carbapenemase gene, rather than clonal expansion or spread of a carbapenemase-harbouring plasmid. Additionally, we found evidence of homologous recombination creating diversity within the local GC2 population, including several events resulting in replacement of the capsule locus. We identified likely donors of the imported capsule locus sequences amongst the A. baumannii isolated on the same ward, suggesting that diversification was largely facilitated via reassortment and sharing of genetic material within the localized A. baumannii population.","727":null,"728":null,"729":null,"730":"Pathogen genomics has the potential to transform the clinical and public health management of infectious diseases through improved diagnosis, detection and tracking of antimicrobial resistance and outbreak control. However, the wide-ranging benefits of this technology can only fully be realized through the timely collation, integration and sharing of genomic and clinical\/epidemiological metadata by all those involved in the delivery of genomic-informed services. As part of our review on bringing pathogen genomics into 'health-service' practice, we undertook extensive stakeholder consultation to examine the factors integral to achieving effective data sharing and integration. Infrastructure tailored to the needs of clinical users, as well as practical support and policies to facilitate the timely and responsible sharing of data with relevant health authorities and beyond, are all essential. We propose a tiered data sharing and integration model to maximize the immediate and longer term utility of microbial genomics in healthcare. Realizing this model at the scale and sophistication necessary to support national and international infection management services is not uncomplicated. Yet the establishment of a clear data strategy is paramount if failures in containing disease spread due to inadequate knowledge sharing are to be averted, and substantial progress made in tackling the dangers posed by infectious diseases.","731":"Firmicutes and Bacteroidetes are the predominant bacterial phyla colonizing the healthy human large intestine. Whilst both ferment dietary fibre, genes responsible for this important activity have been analysed only in the Bacteroidetes, with very little known about the Firmicutes. This work investigates the carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) in a group of Firmicutes, Roseburia spp. and Eubacterium rectale, which play an important role in producing butyrate from dietary carbohydrates and in health maintenance. Genome sequences of 11 strains representing E. rectale and four Roseburia spp. were analysed for carbohydrate-active genes. Following assembly into a pan-genome, core, variable and unique genes were identified. The 1840 CAZyme genes identified in the pan-genome were assigned to 538 orthologous groups, of which only 26 were present in all strains, indicating considerable inter-strain variability. This analysis was used to categorize the 11 strains into four carbohydrate utilization ecotypes (CUEs), which were shown to correspond to utilization of different carbohydrates for growth. Many glycoside hydrolase genes were found linked to genes encoding oligosaccharide transporters and regulatory elements in the genomes of Roseburia spp. and E. rectale, forming distinct polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs). Whilst PULs are also a common feature in Bacteroidetes, key differences were noted in these Firmicutes, including the absence of close homologues of Bacteroides polysaccharide utilization genes, hence we refer to Gram-positive PULs (gpPULs). Most CAZyme genes in the Roseburia\/E. rectale group are organized into gpPULs. Variation in gpPULs can explain the high degree of nutritional specialization at the species level within this group.","732":"Klebsiella pneumoniae is a growing cause of healthcare-associated infections for which multi-drug resistance is a concern. Its polysaccharide capsule is a major virulence determinant and epidemiological marker. However, little is known about capsule epidemiology since serological typing is not widely accessible and many isolates are serologically non-typeable. Molecular typing techniques provide useful insights, but existing methods fail to take full advantage of the information in whole genome sequences. We investigated the diversity of the capsule synthesis loci (K-loci) among 2503 K. pneumoniae genomes. We incorporated analyses of full-length K-locus nucleotide sequences and also clustered protein-encoding sequences to identify, annotate and compare K-locus structures. We propose a standardized nomenclature for K-loci and present a curated reference database. A total of 134 distinct K-loci were identified, including 31 novel types. Comparative analyses indicated 508 unique protein-encoding gene clusters that appear to reassort via homologous recombination. Extensive intra- and inter-locus nucleotide diversity was detected among the wzi and wzc genes, indicating that current molecular typing schemes based on these genes are inadequate. As a solution, we introduce Kaptive, a novel software tool that automates the process of identifying K-loci based on full locus information extracted from whole genome sequences (https:\/\/github.com\/katholt\/Kaptive). This work highlights the extensive diversity of Klebsiella K-loci and the proteins that they encode. The nomenclature, reference database and novel typing method presented here will become essential resources for genomic surveillance and epidemiological investigations of this pathogen.","733":"For many infections transmitting to humans from reservoirs in nature, disease dispersal patterns over space and time are largely unknown. Here, a reversed genomics approach helped us understand disease dispersal and yielded insight into evolution and biological properties of Francisella tularensis, the bacterium causing tularemia. We whole-genome sequenced 67 strains and characterized by single-nucleotide polymorphism assays 138 strains, collected from individuals infected 1947-2012 across Western Europe. We used the data for phylogenetic, population genetic and geographical network analyses. All strains (n=205) belonged to a monophyletic population of recent ancestry not found outside Western Europe. Most strains (n=195) throughout the study area were assigned to a star-like phylogenetic pattern indicating that colonization of Western Europe occurred via clonal expansion. In the East of the study area, strains were more diverse, consistent with a founder population spreading from east to west. The relationship of genetic and geographic distance within the F. tularensis population was complex and indicated multiple long-distance dispersal events. Mutation rate estimates based on year of isolation indicated null rates; in outbreak hotspots only, there was a rate of 0.4 mutations\/genome\/year. Patterns of nucleotide substitution showed marked AT mutational bias suggestive of genetic drift. These results demonstrate that tularemia has moved from east to west in Europe and that F. tularensis has a biology characterized by long-range geographical dispersal events and mostly slow, but variable, replication rates. The results indicate that mutation-driven evolution, a resting survival phase, genetic drift and long-distance geographical dispersal events have interacted to generate genetic diversity within this species.","734":"It has become increasingly clear that the composition of mammalian gut microbial communities is substantially diet driven. These microbiota form intricate mutualisms with their hosts, which have profound implications on overall health. For example, many gut microbes are involved in the conversion of host-ingested dietary polysaccharides into host-usable nutrients. One group of important gut microbial symbionts are bacteria in the genus Ruminococcus. Originally isolated from the bovine rumen, ruminococci have been found in numerous mammalian hosts, including other ruminants, and non-ruminants such as horses, pigs and humans. All ruminococci require fermentable carbohydrates for growth, and their substrate preferences appear to be based on the diet of their particular host. Most ruminococci that have been studied are those capable of degrading cellulose, much less is known about non-cellulolytic non-ruminant-associated species, and even less is known about the environmental distribution of ruminococci as a whole. Here, we capitalized on the wealth of publicly available 16S rRNA gene sequences, genomes and large-scale microbiota studies to both resolve the phylogenetic placement of described species in the genus Ruminococcus, and further demonstrate that this genus has largely unexplored diversity and a staggering host distribution. We present evidence that ruminococci are predominantly associated with herbivores and omnivores, and our data supports the hypothesis that very few ruminococci are found consistently in non-host-associated environments. This study not only helps to resolve the phylogeny of this important genus, but also provides a framework for understanding its distribution in natural systems.","735":"We report two cases of severe pneumonia due to clone ST93 methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) presenting from a remote Australian Indigenous community within a 2-week period, and the utilization of whole genome sequences to determine whether these were part of an outbreak. S. aureus was isolated from 12 of 92 nasal swabs collected from 25 community households (including the two index households); one isolate was ST93. Three of five skin lesion S. aureus isolates obtained at the community were ST93. Whole genome sequencing of the ST93 isolates from this study and a further 20 ST93 isolates from the same region suggested that recent transmission and progression to disease had not taken place. The proximity in time and space of the two severe pneumonia cases is probably a reflection of the high burden of disease due to ST93 MRSA in this population where skin infections and household crowding are common.","736":"Enterohaemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) O157 is a zoonotic pathogen for which colonization of cattle and virulence in humans is associated with multiple horizontally acquired genes, the majority present in active or cryptic prophages. Our understanding of the evolution and phylogeny of EHEC O157 continues to develop primarily based on core genome analyses; however, such short-read sequences have limited value for the analysis of prophage content and its chromosomal location. In this study, we applied Single Molecule Real Time (SMRT) sequencing, using the Pacific Biosciences long-read sequencing platform, to isolates selected from the main sub-clusters of this clonal group. Prophage regions were extracted from these sequences and from published reference strains. Genome position and prophage diversity were analysed along with genetic content. Prophages could be assigned to clusters, with smaller prophages generally exhibiting less diversity and preferential loss of structural genes. Prophages encoding Shiga toxin (Stx) 2a and Stx1a were the most diverse, and more variable compared to prophages encoding Stx2c, further supporting the hypothesis that Stx2c-prophage integration was ancestral to acquisition of other Stx types. The concept that phage type (PT) 21\/28 (Stx2a+, Stx2c+) strains evolved from PT32 (Stx2c+) was supported by analysis of strains with excised Stx-encoding prophages. Insertion sequence elements were over-represented in prophage sequences compared to the rest of the genome, showing integration in key genes such as stx and an excisionase, the latter potentially acting to capture the bacteriophage into the genome. Prophage profiling should allow more accurate prediction of the pathogenic potential of isolates.","737":null,"738":"Estimating the rates at which bacterial genomes evolve is critical to understanding major evolutionary and ecological processes such as disease emergence, long-term host-pathogen associations and short-term transmission patterns. The surge in bacterial genomic data sets provides a new opportunity to estimate these rates and reveal the factors that shape bacterial evolutionary dynamics. For many organisms estimates of evolutionary rate display an inverse association with the time-scale over which the data are sampled. However, this relationship remains unexplored in bacteria due to the difficulty in estimating genome-wide evolutionary rates, which are impacted by the extent of temporal structure in the data and the prevalence of recombination. We collected 36 whole genome sequence data sets from 16 species of bacterial pathogens to systematically estimate and compare their evolutionary rates and assess the extent of temporal structure in the absence of recombination. The majority (28\/36) of data sets possessed sufficient clock-like structure to robustly estimate evolutionary rates. However, in some species reliable estimates were not possible even with 'ancient DNA' data sampled over many centuries, suggesting that they evolve very slowly or that they display extensive rate variation among lineages. The robustly estimated evolutionary rates spanned several orders of magnitude, from approximately 10-5 to 10-8 nucleotide substitutions per site year-1. This variation was negatively associated with sampling time, with this relationship best described by an exponential decay curve. To avoid potential estimation biases, such time-dependency should be considered when inferring evolutionary time-scales in bacteria.","739":"Visualization is frequently used to aid our interpretation of complex datasets. Within microbial genomics, visualizing the relationships between multiple genomes as a tree provides a framework onto which associated data (geographical, temporal, phenotypic and epidemiological) are added to generate hypotheses and to explore the dynamics of the system under investigation. Selected static images are then used within publications to highlight the key findings to a wider audience. However, these images are a very inadequate way of exploring and interpreting the richness of the data. There is, therefore, a need for flexible, interactive software that presents the population genomic outputs and associated data in a user-friendly manner for a wide range of end users, from trained bioinformaticians to front-line epidemiologists and health workers. Here, we present Microreact, a web application for the easy visualization of datasets consisting of any combination of trees, geographical, temporal and associated metadata. Data files can be uploaded to Microreact directly via the web browser or by linking to their location (e.g. from Google Drive\/Dropbox or via API), and an integrated visualization via trees, maps, timelines and tables provides interactive querying of the data. The visualization can be shared as a permanent web link among collaborators, or embedded within publications to enable readers to explore and download the data.

Epidemiological investigations did not identify a common source of exposure. To analyse the population structure and genetic diversity of these Salmonella Paratyphi A isolates, we used whole-genome sequencing on 65 isolates collected from 1999 to 2014: 55 from infections acquired in Cambodia and 10 from infections acquired in other countries in Asia, Africa and Europe. Short-read sequences from 80 published genomes from around the world and from 13 published genomes associated with an outbreak in China were also included. Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) was performed on a subset of isolates. Genomic analyses were found to provide much more accurate information for tracking the individual strains than PFGE. All but 2 of the 36 isolates acquired in Cambodia during 2013-2014 belonged to the same clade, C5, of lineage C. This clade has been isolated in Cambodia since at least 1999. The Chinese outbreak isolates belonged to a different clade (C4) and were resistant to nalidixic acid, whereas the Cambodian outbreak isolates displayed pan-susceptibility to antibiotics. Since 2014, the total number of cases has decreased, but there has been an increase in the frequency with which nalidixic acid-resistant C5 isolates are isolated. The frequency of these isolates should be monitored over time, because they display decreased susceptibility to ciprofloxacin, the first-choice antibiotic for treating paratyphoid fever.","741":null,"742":"Many bacterial pathogens are well characterized but, in some cases, little is known about the populations from which they emerged. This limits understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying disease. The crop pathogen Pseudomonas syringae sensu lato has been widely isolated from the environment, including wild plants and components of the water cycle, and causes disease in several economically important crops. Here, we compared genome sequences of 45 P. syringae crop pathogen outbreak strains with 69 closely related environmental isolates. Phylogenetic reconstruction revealed that crop pathogens emerged many times independently from environmental populations. Unexpectedly, differences in gene content between environmental populations and outbreak strains were minimal with most virulence genes present in both. However, a genome-wide association study identified a small number of genes, including the type III effector genes hopQ1 and hopD1, to be associated with crop pathogens, but not with environmental populations, suggesting that this small group of genes may play an important role in crop disease emergence. Intriguingly, genome-wide analysis of homologous recombination revealed that the locus Psyr 0346, predicted to encode a protein that confers antibiotic resistance, has been frequently exchanged among lineages and thus may contribute to pathogen fitness. Finally, we found that isolates from diseased crops and from components of the water cycle, collected during the same crop disease epidemic, form a single population. This provides the strongest evidence yet that precipitation and irrigation water are an overlooked inoculum source for disease epidemics caused by P. syringae.","743":"The decreased costs of genome sequencing have increased the capability to apply whole-genome sequencing to epidemiological surveillance of zoonotic Campylobacter jejuni. However, knowledge of the genetic diversity of this bacteria is vital for inferring relatedness between epidemiologically linked isolates and a necessary prerequisite for correct application of this methodology. To address this issue in C. jejuni we investigated the spatial and temporal signals in the genomes of a major clonal complex and generalist lineage, ST-45 CC, by analysing the population structure and genealogy as well as applying genome-wide association analysis of 340 isolates from across Europe collected over a wide time range. The occurrence and strength of the geographical signal varied between sublineages and followed the clonal frame when present, while no evidence of a temporal signal was found. Certain sublineages of ST-45 formed discrete and genetically isolated clades containing isolates with extremely similar genomes regardless of time and location of sampling. Based on a separate data set, these monomorphic genotypes represent successful C. jejuni clones, possibly spread around the globe by rapid animal (migrating birds), food or human movement. In addition, we observed an incongruence between the genealogy of the strains and multilocus sequence typing (MLST), challenging the existing clonal complex definition and the use of whole-genome gene-by-gene hierarchical nomenclature schemes for C. jejuni.","744":"The RegB\/RegA two-component system from Rhodobacter capsulatus regulates global changes in gene expression in response to alterations in oxygen levels. Studies have shown that RegB\/RegA controls many energy-generating and energy-utilizing systems such as photosynthesis, nitrogen fixation, carbon fixation, hydrogen utilization, respiration, electron transport and denitrification. In this report, we utilized RNA-seq and ChIP-seq to analyse the breadth of genes indirectly and directly regulated by RegA. A comparison of mRNA transcript levels in wild type cells relative to a RegA deletion strain shows that there are 257 differentially expressed genes under photosynthetic defined minimal growth medium conditions and 591 differentially expressed genes when grown photosynthetically in a complex rich medium. ChIP-seq analysis also identified 61 unique RegA binding sites with a well-conserved recognition sequence, 33 of which exhibit changes in neighbouring gene expression. These transcriptome results define new members of the RegA regulon including genes involved in iron transport and motility. These results also reveal that the set of genes that are regulated by RegA are growth medium specific. Similar analyses under dark aerobic conditions where RegA is thought not to be phosphorylated by RegB reveal 40 genes that are differentially expressed in minimal medium and 20 in rich medium. Finally, a comparison of the R. capsulatus RegA regulon with the orthologous PrrA regulon in Rhodobacter sphaeroides shows that the number of photosystem genes regulated by RegA and PrrA are similar but that the identity of genes regulated by RegA and PrrA beyond those involved in photosynthesis are quite distinct.","745":"In an genomics course sponsored by the Howard Hughes Medical Institute (HHMI), undergraduate students have isolated and sequenced the genomes of more than 1,150 mycobacteriophages, creating the largest database of sequenced bacteriophages able to infect a single host, Mycobacterium smegmatis, a soil bacterium. Genomic analysis indicates that these mycobacteriophages can be grouped into 26 clusters based on genetic similarity. These clusters span a continuum of genetic diversity, with extensive genomic mosaicism among phages in different clusters. However, little is known regarding the primary hosts of these mycobacteriophages in their natural habitats, nor of their broader host ranges. As such, it is possible that the primary host of many newly isolated mycobacteriophages is not M. smegmatis, but instead a range of closely related bacterial species. However, determining mycobacteriophage host range presents difficulties associated with mycobacterial cultivability, pathogenicity and growth. Another way to gain insight into mycobacteriophage host range and ecology is through bioinformatic analysis of their genomic sequences. To this end, we examined the correlations between the codon usage biases of 199 different mycobacteriophages and those of several fully sequenced mycobacterial species in order to gain insight into the natural host range of these mycobacteriophages. We find that UPGMA clustering tends to match, but not consistently, clustering by shared nucleotide sequence identify. In addition, analysis of GC content, tRNA usage and correlations between mycobacteriophage and mycobacterial codon usage bias suggests that the preferred host of many clustered mycobacteriophages is not M. smegmatis but other, as yet unknown, members of the mycobacteria complex or closely allied bacterial species.","746":"The pneumococcus is a leading global pathogen and a key virulence factor possessed by the majority of pneumococci is an antigenic polysaccharide capsule ('serotype'), which is encoded by the capsular (cps) locus. Approximately 100 different serotypes are known, but the extent of sequence diversity within the cps loci of individual serotypes is not well understood. Investigating serotype-specific sequence variation is crucial to the design of sequence-based serotyping methodology, understanding pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) effectiveness and the design of future PCVs. The availability of large genome datasets makes it possible to assess population-level variation among pneumococcal serotypes and in this study 5405 pneumococcal genomes were used to investigate cps locus diversity among 49 different serotypes. Pneumococci had been recovered between 1916 and 2014 from people of all ages living in 51 countries. Serotypes were deduced bioinformatically, cps locus sequences were extracted and variation was assessed within the cps locus, in the context of pneumococcal genetic lineages. Overall, cps locus sequence diversity varied markedly: low to moderate diversity was revealed among serogroups\/types 1, 3, 7, 9, 11 and 22; whereas serogroups\/types 6, 19, 23, 14, 15, 18, 33 and 35 displayed high diversity. Putative novel and\/or hybrid cps loci were identified among all serogroups\/types apart from 1, 3 and 9. This study demonstrated that cps locus sequence diversity varied widely between serogroups\/types. Investigation of the biochemical structure of the polysaccharide capsule of major variants, particularly PCV-related serotypes and those that appear to be novel or hybrids, is warranted.","747":"Bacteria can exchange genetic material, or acquire genes found in the environment. This process, generally known as bacterial recombination, can have a strong impact on the evolution and phenotype of bacteria, for example causing the spread of antibiotic resistance across clades and species, but can also disrupt phylogenetic and transmission inferences. With the increasing affordability of whole genome sequencing, the need has emerged for an efficient simulator of bacterial evolution to test and compare methods for phylogenetic and population genetic inference, and for simulation-based estimation. We present SimBac, a whole-genome bacterial evolution simulator that is roughly two orders of magnitude faster than previous software and includes a more general model of bacterial evolution, allowing both within- and between-species homologous recombination. Since methods modelling bacterial recombination generally focus on only one of these two modes of recombination, the possibility to simulate both allows for a general and fair benchmarking. SimBac is available from https:\/\/github.com\/tbrown91\/SimBac and is distributed as open source under the terms of the GNU General Public Licence.","748":"Enterococcus faecium, a major cause of hospital-acquired infections, remains problematic because of its propensity to acquire resistance to vancomycin, which currently is considered first-line therapy. Here, we assess the evolution and resistance acquisition dynamics of E. faecium in a clinical context using a series of 132 bloodstream infection isolates from a single hospital. All isolates, of which 49 (37 %) were vancomycin-resistant, underwent whole-genome sequencing. E. faecium was found to be subject to high rates of recombination with little evidence of sequence importation from outside the local E. faecium population. Apart from disrupting phylogenetic reconstruction, recombination was frequent enough to invalidate MLST typing in the identification of clonal expansion and transmission events, suggesting that, where available, whole-genome sequencing should be used in tracing the epidemiology of E. faecium nosocomial infections and establishing routes of transmission. Several forms of the Tn1549-like element-vanB gene cluster, which was exclusively responsible for vancomycin resistance, appeared and spread within the hospital during the study period. Several transposon gains and losses and instances of in situ evolution were inferred and, although usually chromosomal, the resistance element was also observed on a plasmid background. There was qualitative evidence for clonal expansions of both vancomycin-resistant and vancomycin-susceptible E. faecium with evidence of hospital-specific subclonal expansion. Our data are consistent with continuing evolution of this established hospital pathogen and confirm hospital vancomycin-susceptible and vancomycin-resistant E. faecium patient transmission events, underlining the need for careful consideration before modifying current E. faecium infection control strategies.","749":null,"750":"The MocR-subfamily transcription factors (MocR-TFs) characterized by the GntR-family DNA-binding domain and aminotransferase-like sensory domain are broadly distributed among certain lineages of Bacteria. Characterized MocR-TFs bind pyridoxal 5'-phosphate (PLP) and control transcription of genes involved in PLP, gamma aminobutyric acid (GABA) and taurine metabolism via binding specific DNA operator sites. To identify putative target genes and DNA binding motifs of MocR-TFs, we performed comparative genomics analysis of over 250 bacterial genomes. The reconstructed regulons for 825 MocR-TFs comprise structural genes from over 200 protein families involved in diverse biological processes. Using the genome context and metabolic subsystem analysis we tentatively assigned functional roles for 38 out of 86 orthologous groups of studied regulators. Most of these MocR-TF regulons are involved in PLP metabolism, as well as utilization of GABA, taurine and ectoine. The remaining studied MocR-TF regulators presumably control genes encoding enzymes involved in reduction\/oxidation processes, various transporters and PLP-dependent enzymes, for example aminotransferases. Predicted DNA binding motifs of MocR-TFs are generally similar in each orthologous group and are characterized by two to four repeated sequences. Identified motifs were classified according to their structures. Motifs with direct and\/or inverted repeat symmetry constitute the majority of inferred DNA motifs, suggesting preferable TF dimerization in head-to-tail or head-to-head configuration. The obtained genomic collection of in silico reconstructed MocR-TF motifs and regulons in Bacteria provides a basis for future experimental characterization of molecular mechanisms for various regulators in this family.","751":null,"752":"In the context of the Microbiology Society's 70th anniversary celebration, Microbial Genomics (MGen) is the new baby of the Society's publishing family.

Investigations by the Health Protection Agency (now Public Health England) employing multi-locus-variable number tandem repeat analysis had previously linked the clinical cases to spores associated with animal skins and drums the patients had been in contact with. In this study, whole-genome sequencing of 23 Bacillus anthracis isolates harvested during the investigations was performed. High-quality draft assemblies of these genomes provided greater characterization of the B. anthracis strains present and placed them all upon a new branch of the global phylogeny. Although closely related, the clinical isolates from the two events, and another isolated from a drum-skin-associated case in New York in 2006, were distinct from each other. Multiple distinct genotypes were found during both investigations, implying either multiple contamination events or a single heterogeneous contamination. One environmental isolate from the Scottish incident was more closely related to London isolates than to the other Scottish isolates. As B. anthracis of this subgroup was present at both geographically and temporally distinct events, it may be more widespread at the source of contamination. All isolates were distinct from currently characterized West African strains, despite this being the likely origin of the drums and hides, therefore adding to our knowledge of B. anthracis diversity in the region.","756":"Parsing and manipulating long and\/or multiple protein or gene sequences can be a challenging process for experimental biologists and microbiologists lacking prior knowledge of bioinformatics and programming. Here we present a simple, easy, user-friendly and versatile tool to parse, manipulate and search within large datasets of long and multiple protein or gene sequences. The Shetti tool can be used to search for a sequence, species, protein\/gene or pattern\/motif. Moreover, it can also be used to construct a universal consensus or molecular signatures for proteins based on their physical characteristics. Shetti is an efficient and fast tool that can deal with large sets of long sequences efficiently. Shetti parses UniProt Knowledgebase and NCBI GenBank flat files and visualizes them as a table.","757":"Population samples show bacterial genomes can be divided into a core of ubiquitous genes and accessory genes that are present in a fraction of isolates. The ecological significance of this variation in gene content remains unclear. However, microbiologists agree that a bacterial species should be 'genomically coherent', even though there is no consensus on how this should be determined. We use a parsimonious model combining diversification in both the core and accessory genome, including mutation, homologous recombination (HR) and horizontal gene transfer (HGT) introducing new loci, to produce a population of interacting clusters of strains with varying genome content. New loci introduced by HGT may then be transferred on by HR. The model fits well to a systematic population sample of 616 pneumococcal genomes, capturing the major features of the population structure with parameter values that agree well with empirical estimates. The model does not include explicit selection on individual genes, suggesting that crude comparisons of gene content may be a poor predictor of ecological function. We identify a clearly divergent subpopulation of pneumococci that are inconsistent with the model and may be considered genomically incoherent with the rest of the population. These strains have a distinct disease tropism and may be rationally defined as a separate species. We also find deviations from the model that may be explained by recent population bottlenecks or spatial structure. ","758":null,"759":null,"760":"Recent development of CRISPR-Cas9 genome editing has enabled highly efficient and versatile manipulation of a variety of organisms and adaptation of the CRISPR-Cas9 system to eukaryotic pathogens has opened new avenues for studying these otherwise hard to manipulate organisms. Here we describe a webtool, Eukaryotic Pathogen gRNA Design Tool (EuPaGDT; available at http:\/\/grna.ctegd.uga.edu), which identifies guide RNA (gRNA) in input gene(s) to guide users in arriving at well-informed and appropriate gRNA design for many eukaryotic pathogens. Flexibility in gRNA design, accommodating unique eukaryotic pathogen (gene and genome) attributes and high-throughput gRNA design are the main features that distinguish EuPaGDT from other gRNA design tools. In addition to employing an array of known principles to score and rank gRNAs, EuPaGDT implements an effective on-target search algorithm to identify gRNA targeting multi-gene families, which are highly represented in these pathogens and play important roles in host-pathogen interactions. EuPaGDT also identifies and scores microhomology sequences flanking each gRNA targeted cut-site; these sites are often essential for the microhomology-mediated end joining process used for double-stranded break repair in these organisms. EuPaGDT also assists users in designing single-stranded oligonucleotides for homology directed repair. In batch processing mode, EuPaGDT is able to process genome-scale sequences, enabling preparation of gRNA libraries for large-scale screening projects.","761":"Uropathogenic Escherchia coli (UPEC) is the causative agent of urinary tract infections. Nitric oxide (NO) is a toxic water-soluble gas that is encountered by UPEC in the urinary tract. Therefore, UPEC probably requires mechanisms to detoxify NO in the host environment. Thus far, flavohaemoglobin (Hmp), an NO denitrosylase, is the only demonstrated NO detoxification system in UPEC. Here we show that, in E. coli strain CFT073, the NADH-dependent NO reductase flavorubredoxin (FlRd) also plays a major role in NO scavenging. We generated a mutant that lacks all known and candidate NO detoxification pathways (Hmp, FlRd and the respiratory nitrite reductase, NrfA). When grown and assayed anaerobically, this mutant expresses an NO-inducible NO scavenging activity, pointing to the existence of a novel detoxification mechanism. Expression of this activity is inducible by both NO and nitrate, and the enzyme is membrane-associated. Genome-wide transcriptional profiling of UPEC grown under anaerobic conditions in the presence of nitrate (as a source of NO) highlighted various aspects of the response of the pathogen to nitrate and NO. Several virulence-associated genes are upregulated, suggesting that host-derived NO is a potential regulator of UPEC virulence. Chromatin immunoprecipitation and sequencing was used to evaluate the NsrR regulon in CFT073. We identified 49 NsrR binding sites in promoter regions in the CFT073 genome, 29 of which were not previously identified in E. coli K-12. NsrR may regulate some CFT073 genes that do not have homologues in E. coli K-12.","762":"Yersinia enterocolitica is a common cause of food-borne gastroenteritis worldwide. Recent work defining the phylogeny of the genus Yersinia subdivided Y. enterocolitica into six distinct phylogroups. Here, we provide detailed analyses of the evolutionary processes leading to the emergence of these phylogroups. The dominant phylogroups isolated from human infections, PG3-5, show very little diversity at the sequence level, but do present marked patterns of gain and loss of functions, including those involved in pathogenicity and metabolism, including the acquisition of phylogroup-specific O-antigen loci. We tracked gene flow across the species in the core and accessory genome, and show that the non-pathogenic PG1 strains act as a reservoir for diversity, frequently acting as donors in recombination events. Analysis of the core and accessory genome also suggested that the different Y. enterocolitica phylogroups may be ecologically separated, in contrast to the long-held belief of common shared ecological niches across the Y. enterocolitica species.","763":null,"764":"Serotype 1 Streptococcus pneumoniae is a leading cause of invasive pneumococcal disease (IPD) worldwide, with the highest burden in developing countries. We report the whole-genome sequencing analysis of 448 serotype 1 isolates from 27 countries worldwide (including 11 in Africa). The global serotype 1 population shows a strong phylogeographic structure at the continental level, and within Africa there is further region-specific structure. Our results demonstrate that region-specific diversification within Africa has been driven by limited cross-region transfer events, genetic recombination and antimicrobial selective pressure. Clonal replacement of the dominant serotype 1 clones circulating within regions is uncommon; however, here we report on the accessory gene content that has contributed to a rare clonal replacement event of ST3081 with ST618 as the dominant cause of IPD in the Gambia.","765":"Yersinia pestis, the causative agent of plague, is best known for historical pandemics, but still actively causes disease in many parts of the world. Y. pestis is a recently derived clone of the pathogenic species Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, but is more associated with human infection. Numerous studies have documented genomic changes since the two species differentiated, although all of these studies used a relatively small sample set for defining these differences. In this study, we compared the complete genomic content between a diverse set of Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis genomes, and identified unique loci that could serve as diagnostic markers or for better understanding the evolution and pathogenesis of each group. Comparative genomics analyses also identified subtle variations in gene content between individual monophyletic clades within these species, based on a core genome single nucleotide polymorphism phylogeny that would have been undetected in a less comprehensive genome dataset. We also screened loci that were identified in other published studies as unique to either species and generally found a non-uniform distribution, suggesting that the assignment of these unique genes to either species should be re-evaluated in the context of current sequencing efforts. Overall, this study provides a high-resolution view into the genomic differences between Y. pestis and Y. pseudotuberculosis, demonstrating fine-scale differentiation and unique gene composition in both species.","766":null,"767":"The recent growth in publicly available sequence data has introduced new opportunities for studying microbial evolution and spread. Because the pace of sequence accumulation tends to exceed the pace of experimental studies of protein function and the roles of individual amino acids, statistical tools to identify meaningful patterns in protein diversity are essential. Large sequence alignments from fast-evolving micro-organisms are particularly challenging to dissect using standard tools from phylogenetics and multivariate statistics because biologically relevant functional signals are easily masked by neutral variation and noise. To meet this need, a novel computational method is introduced that is easily executed in parallel using a cluster environment and can handle thousands of sequences with minimal subjective input from the user. The usefulness of this kind of machine learning is demonstrated by applying it to nearly 5000 haemagglutinin sequences of influenza A\/H3N2.Antigenic and 3D structural mapping of the results show that the method can recover the major jumps in antigenic phenotype that occurred between 1968 and 2013 and identify specific amino acids associated with these changes. The method is expected to provide a useful tool to uncover patterns of protein evolution.","768":"Leucine-responsive regulatory protein (Lrp) is a transcriptional regulator for the genes involved in transport, biosynthesis and catabolism of amino acids in Escherichia coli. In order to identify the whole set of genes under the direct control of Lrp, we performed Genomic SELEX screening and identified a total of 314 Lrp-binding sites on the E. coli genome. As a result, the regulation target of Lrp was predicted to expand from the hitherto identified genes for amino acid metabolism to a set of novel target genes for utilization of amino acids for protein synthesis, including tRNAs, aminoacyl-tRNA synthases and rRNAs. Northern blot analysis indicated alteration of mRNA levels for at least some novel targets, including the aminoacyl-tRNA synthetase genes. Phenotype MicroArray of the lrp mutant indicated significant alteration in utilization of amino acids and peptides, whilst metabolome analysis showed variations in the concentration of amino acids in the lrp mutant. From these two datasets we realized a reverse correlation between amino acid levels and cell growth rate: fast-growing cells contain low-level amino acids, whilst a high level of amino acids exists in slow-growing cells. Taken together, we propose that Lrp is a global regulator of transcription of a large number of the genes involved in not only amino acid transport and metabolism, but also amino acid utilization."},"articletitle":{"0":"Helicobacter cinaedi is a human-adapted lineage in the Helicobacter cinaedi\/canicola\/'magdeburgensis' complex.","1":"Profiling the plasmid conjugation potential
