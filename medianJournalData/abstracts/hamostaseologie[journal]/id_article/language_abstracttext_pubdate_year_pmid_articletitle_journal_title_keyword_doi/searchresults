von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) is a rare bleeding disorder caused by various underlying diseases or conditions and should be distinguished from the inherited type of von Willebrand disease. AVWS is associated with underlying diseases such as cardiovascular, autoimmune, malignant, proliferative disorders, or with mechanical circulatory support (MCS). AVWS was first reported in 1968 and most case reports describe AVWS in adults. However, AVWS can appear in pediatric patients occasionally as well. Because bleeding complications are rare in everyday life, AVWS may be underdiagnosed in pediatric patients. Therefore, the diagnosis should be suspected in a pediatric patient who is known for one of these underlying diseases or conditions and who presents with an onset of bleeding symptoms, especially before the child will undergo an invasive procedure. Here, we present an overview of the diagnostic analyses regarding AVWS and of the underlying diseases or conditions in which AVWS should be considered. Importantly, the patient's history should be investigated for bleeding symptoms (mucocutaneous or postoperative bleeding). As no single routine coagulation test can reliably confirm or exclude AVWS, the diagnosis may be challenging. Laboratory investigations should include analysis of von Willebrand factor (VWF):antigen, VWF:collagen-binding capacity, VWF:activity, and VWF multimeric analyses. For treatment, tranexamic acid, 1-desamino-8-D-arginine vasopressin, and VWF-containing concentrate can be used. AVWS disappears after the underlying disease has been successfully treated or the MCS has been explanted.","4":"Emicizumab is the first approved nonreplacement therapy for bleeding prophylaxis in hemophilia A (HA) patients. In 2018, it was licensed for HA patients with inhibitors, subsequently followed by an \"European Medicines Agency (EMA)\" approval for patients with severe HA in the absence of inhibitors in 2019. This is immediately raising the question whether emicizumab is suitable as a first-line treatment for all pediatric patients with severe HA. In this review, we want to discuss what we have, what we know, and what we would like to know. Severe HA is characterized by severe spontaneous and traumatic bleedings, particularly into muscles and joints leading to chronic joint damage. Standard of care is the regular, prophylactic replacement of factor VIII to prevent bleedings. Due to approval of emicizumab-the first nonreplacement therapy for bleeding prophylaxis-in HA patients with inhibitors, and severe HA patients without inhibitors, it is of pivotal interest whether emicizumab could be the first-line treatment in all pediatric patients with severe HA. Clinical trials and real-world observational studies could demonstrate a good efficacy and safety for bleeding prevention during emicizumab treatment in HA patients with and without inhibitors. This clearly indicates that emicizumab could improve HA treatment. However, some crucial and critical questions are remaining with regard to the use of emicizumab. Some of this missing information is already under investigation in the context of clinical trials. Until getting finalized data to shed insights into the points that are currently being discussed, there is a variety of expert and expert group recommendations, which are tackling questions concerning the treatment of HA patients. This review will address major information that is already available, but will also focus on important points that remain to be elucidated in the context of HA treatment.","5":"","6":"Coagulation abnormalities are common in patients with COVID-19 and associated with high morbidity and mortality. It became a daily challenge to navigate through these abnormal laboratory findings and deliver the best possible treatment to the patients. The unique character of COVID-19-induced coagulopathy necessitates not only a dynamic follow-up of the patients in terms of hemostatic findings but also the introduction of new diagnostic methods to determine the overall function of the coagulation system in real time. After the recognition of the high risk of thromboembolism in COVID-19, several professional societies published their recommendations regarding anticoagulation in patients with COVID-19. This review summarizes common hemostatic findings in COVID-19 patients and presents the societal recommendations regarding the use of coagulation laboratory findings in clinical decision-making. Although several studies have investigated coagulation parameters in patients with COVID-19, the methodological shortcomings of published studies as well as the differences in employed anticoagulation regimens that have changed over time, depending on national and international guidelines, limit the applicability of these findings in other clinical settings. Accordingly, evidence-based recommendations for diagnostics during acute COVID-19 infection are still lacking. Future studies should verify the role of coagulation parameters as well as viscoelastic methods in the management of patients with COVID-19.","7":null,"8":null,"9":null,"10":null,"11":"","12":"Antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs work at different places in the coagulation system. Antiplatelet drugs are usually indicated in patients with atherosclerosis. Anticoagulant drugs are mostly used in patients with atrial fibrillation, venous thromboembolism, or technical heart valves. In some clinical situations, combination of antiplatelet and anticoagulant therapy can be indicated. The most recent situations are a more intensive antithrombotic therapy for risk reduction in patients with atherosclerosis and temporary addition of antiplatelet drugs in patients with indication for long-term anticoagulation. Temporary combination of antiplatelet and anticoagulant drugs is usually necessary after coronary intervention in patients with atrial fibrillation. In patients with high-risk atherosclerosis, the combination of low-dose rivaroxaban and aspirin reduces major adverse cardiovascular events (myocardial infarction, stroke, cardiovascular death) and major adverse limb events. But every combination of antiplatelet and antithrombotic drugs can increase bleeding risk. Therefore, a careful assessment of thrombotic versus bleeding risk is necessary for each patient.","13":"Blood coagulation is essential to maintain the integrity of a closed circulatory system (hemostasis), but also contributes to thromboembolic occlusion of vessels (thrombosis). Thrombosis may cause deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism, myocardial infarction, peripheral artery disease, and ischemic stroke, collectively the most common causes of death and disability in the developed world. Treatment for the prevention of thromboembolic diseases using anticoagulants such as heparin, coumarins, thrombin inhibitors, or antiplatelet drugs increase the risk of bleeding and are associated with an increase in potentially life-threatening hemorrhage, partially offsetting the benefits of reduced coagulation. Thus, drug development aiming at novel targets is needed to provide efficient and safe anticoagulation. Within the last decade, experimental and preclinical data have shown that some coagulation mechanisms principally differ in thrombosis and hemostasis. The plasma contact system protein factors XII and XI, high-molecular-weight kininogen, and plasma kallikrein specifically contribute to thrombosis, however, have minor, if any, role in hemostatic coagulation mechanisms. Inherited deficiency in contact system proteins is not associated with increased bleeding in humans and animal models. Therefore, targeting contact system proteins provides the exciting opportunity to interfere specifically with thromboembolic diseases without increasing the bleeding risk. Recent studies that investigated pharmacologic inhibition of contact system proteins have shown that this approach provides efficient and safe thrombo-protection that in contrast to classical anticoagulants is not associated with increased bleeding risk. This review summarizes therapeutic and conceptual developments for selective interference with pathological thrombus formation, while sparing physiologic hemostasis, that enables safe anticoagulation treatment.","14":"Compared with nonpregnant women, pregnancy carries a four- to fivefold higher risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). Despite increasing use of heparin prophylaxis in identified high-risk patients, pulmonary embolism still is the leading cause of maternal mortality in the western world. However, evidence on optimal use of thromboprophylaxis is scarce. Thrombophilia, the hereditary or acquired tendency to develop VTE, is also thought to be associated with complications in pregnancy, such as recurrent miscarriage and preeclampsia. In this review, the current evidence on optimal thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy is discussed, focusing primarily on VTE prevention strategies but also discussing the potential to prevent recurrent pregnancy complications with heparin in pregnant women with thrombophilia.","15":"In patients with normal plasmatic coagulation and bleeding tendency, platelet function defect can be assumed. Congenital platelet function defects are rare. Much more commonly they are acquired. The clinical bleeding tendency of platelet function defects is heterogeneous, which makes diagnostic approaches difficult. During the years, a large variety of tests for morphological phenotyping and functional analysis have been developed. The diagnosis of platelet function defects is based on standardized bleeding assessment tools followed by a profound morphological evaluation of the platelets. Platelet function assays like light transmission aggregation, luminoaggregometry, and impedance aggregometry followed by flow cytometry are commonly used to establish the diagnosis in these patients. Nevertheless, despite great efforts, standardization of these tests is poor and in most cases, quality control is lacking. In addition, these tests are still limited to specialized laboratories. This review summarizes the approaches to morphologic phenotyping and platelet testing in patients with suspected platelet dysfunction, beginning with a standardized bleeding score and ending with flow cytometry testing. The diagnosis of a functional defect requires a good collaboration between the laboratory and the clinician.","16":"The term unusual site thrombosis refers to the occurrence of venous thromboembolism outside of the lower limbs and the pulmonary arteries. Unusual site thrombosis can virtually affect any venous segment, with the most common and\/or clinically relevant sites including the upper limbs veins, the retinal veins, the splanchnic veins and the cerebral veins. Clinical features are obviously heterogeneous, while many predisposing factors are common, though with different prevalence among the various disorders. Antithrombotic therapy is prescribed to most patients, but the type, intensity, and duration of treatment vary both within and among patient groups. Increasing evidence is supporting the use of the direct oral anticoagulants in patients with upper limb deep vein thrombosis, cerebral vein thrombosis, and with splanchnic vein thrombosis. This article will review available evidence on the treatment of venous thrombosis occurring in unusual sites.","17":"","18":null,"19":"Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most prevalent congenital bleeding disorder. Diagnosis and classification of VWD is complex due to its heterogeneity regarding clinical manifestations and molecular genetic analysis. Genetic investigations became an inherent part of diagnosis and help distinguish different types\/subtypes of VWD. Although many variants have been listed being causative for VWD, the genetic etiology remains undefined in a lot of patients. We report about two siblings with severely reduced values for von Willebrand factor collagen-binding activity (VWF:CB). Genetic analysis using panel sequencing identified a heterozygous non-synonymous single nucleotide variant in exon 30. At the protein level, the alteration (p.Ser1731Leu) is located in the A3 collagen-binding domain. The amino acid position is already known to be important for collagen binding because p.Ser1731Thr has been reported to affect the VWF:CB.","20":null,"21":null,"22":"This article explores the communication challenges brought about by the digital revolution in the 21st century for healthcare professionals internationally. It particularly focuses on the use of content-generating and sharing platforms like social media. Globally, healthcare has been irrevocably altered by digital innovation and health professionals deploy an extensive range of social media and web-based tools on a daily basis. However, many healthcare professionals use these platforms in a regulatory vacuum-where there may not be specific legal or ethical guidance-and without an appreciation of the associated risks. Given the special protections afforded to the practitioner-patient relationship, and the importance of a health practitioners' reputation, it is vital that we understand how to traverse the many ethical and legal challenges of the digital interaction. A comprehensive set of recommendations (see \"Guidelines for Good Digital Citizenship in the Health Professions\" on page 5 ff.) to keep practitioners out of trouble is provided. These hinge on the notion of being a \"good person and a good doctor\" as a formative maxim for ethical and legal safety. The constituents of publication, and the consequences of falling foul of acceptable publication standards on social media, are specifically discussed. \"Publication\" involves sharing content with a third party, or a group of people, and social media refers to platforms on which content can be shared with more than one person. Hence, most information that we post on social media can be considered as \"published,\" and as such may attach liability for health professionals who do not use these platforms with requisite care and sufficient forethought.","23":null,"24":"","25":"Here, we report about a preterm female newborn with a prolonged course of severe thrombocytopenia and hematomas. The family history was positive for von Willebrand disease type 2B (VWD 2B). Diagnosis of VWD 2B was identified analyzing von Willebrand factor (VWF) parameters (VWF:antigen, VWF:activity, VWF multimer analyses) and performing light transmission aggregometry (with half concentration of ristocetin). In addition, the diagnosis was confirmed by molecular genetic analysis: identification of a disease-causing missense mutation (Val1316Met) in the VWF gene associated with a severe course of VWD 2B, which had been previously reported. Treatment with a VWF-containing plasma concentrate was initiated. Because the combination of prematurity and very low platelet count is often associated with intracranial bleeding, at the beginning platelet concentrates were transfused. Fortunately, the patient did not develop serious bleeding episodes. Interestingly, the patient had a mutation in the VWF gene, which had been described to be associated with aggravation of thrombocytopenia especially in stressful situations. Therefore, we replaced venous blood withdrawals by capillary blood samplings when possible and, consequently, we observed an increase of the platelet count after this change in management. At the age of 2 months, the patient was discharged after stabilization of the platelet count without any bleeding signs and without a need of long-term medication.","26":"Inherited platelet disorders (IPDs) constitute a large heterogeneous group of rare bleeding disorders. These are classified into: (1) quantitative defects, (2) qualitative disorders, or (3) altered platelet production rate disorders or increased platelet turnover. Classically, IPD diagnostic is based on clinical phenotype characterization, comprehensive laboratory analyses (platelet function analysis), and, in former times, candidate gene sequencing. Today, molecular genetic analysis is performed using next-generation sequencing, mostly by targeting enrichment of a gene panel or by whole-exome sequencing. Still, the biochemical and molecular genetic characterization of patients with congenital thrombocytopathias\/thrombocytopenia is essential, since postoperative or posttraumatic bleeding often occurs due to undiagnosed platelet defects. Depending upon the kind of surgery or trauma, this bleeding may be life-threatening, e.g., after tonsillectomy or in brain surgery. Undiagnosed platelet defects may lead to additional surgery, hysterectomy, pulmonary bleeding, and even resuscitation. In addition, these increased bleeding symptoms can lead to wound healing problems.

Traditional risk factors drive vascular inflammation, further justifying the instrumental role of intensified risk factor management in attenuating and preventing atherosclerotic disease and complications. Promising therapeutic approaches specifically related to inhibition of inflammation span traditional anti-inflammatory drugs, specific immunomodulation, and development of vaccination against atherosclerotic disease.

Despite the increasing availability of next-generation sequencing, a careful phenotyping of suspected patients-concerning the general clinical features, platelet morphology, and function-is still demanded. The cornerstones of IPD diagnosis are clinical evaluation, laboratory characterization, and genetic testing. Achieving a diagnosis of IPD is desirable for several reasons, including the possibility of tailored therapeutic strategies and individual follow-up programs. However, detailed investigations can also open complex scenarios raising ethical issues in case of IPDs predisposing to hematological malignancies.

This leads to the development of pathogenic multimers of VWF, causing a thrombotic microangiopathy with decreased number of platelets, hemolysis, and life-threatening tissue ischemia of mostly brain, heart, and kidneys. Standard treatment of iTTP involves daily plasma exchange to remove ultra large multimers of VWF, inhibitors, substituting ADAMTS13, and the accompaniment of an immunosuppressive treatment with steroids. Recently, caplacizumab was approved for iTTP. Caplacizumab is a nanobody binding the A1 domain of VWF, blocking its interaction with glycoprotein Ib-IX-V platelet receptor and therefore preventing platelet aggregation. VWF activities may serve as therapeutic drug monitoring of caplacizumab, whereas ADAMTS13 activities may be used for biomarkers to guide caplacizumab treatment modalities and overall treatment duration. Additional immunosuppressive treatment by inhibiting autoantibody formation (e.g., the use of Rituximab, a chimeric monoclonal antibody directed against the B-cell antigen CD20) is a further treatment option. Infections are well-known causes for an acute episode for patients with iTTP. The novel SARS-CoV-2 virus is mainly associated with acute respiratory distress as well as diffuse endothelial inflammation and increased coagulopathy.

Increasing numbers of clinical studies have shown associations between circulating miRNA levels and platelet reactivity or the recurrence of cardiovascular events. However, these studies differed regarding population selection, sample types used, miRNA quantification procedures, and platelet function assays. Furthermore, they often lacked functional validation of the miRNA identified in such studies. The latter step is essential to identifying causal relationships and understanding if and how miRNAs regulate platelet function.

The spectrum of platelet serine\/threonine protein kinases (more than 100) includes the AGC family (protein kinase A, G, C [PKA, PKG, PKC]), the mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), and others. PKA and PKG have multiple significantly overlapping substrates in human platelets, which possibly affect functions with clear \"signaling nodes\" of regulation by multiple protein kinases\/phosphatases. Signaling nodes are intracellular Ca2+ stores, the contractile system (myosin light chains), and other signaling components such as G-proteins, protein kinases, and protein phosphatases. An example for this fine-tuning is the tyrosine kinase Syk, a crucial component of platelet activation, which is controlled by several serine\/threonine and tyrosine protein kinases as well as phosphatases. Other protein kinases including PKA\/PKG modulate protein phosphatase 2A, which may be a master regulator of MAPK signaling in human platelets. Protein kinases and in particular MAPKs are targeted by an increasing number of clinically used inhibitors. However, the precise regulation and fine-tuning of these protein kinases and their effects on other signaling components in platelets are only superficially understood-just the beginning.

Attention has also been drawn to JAK2 mutant clonal hematopoiesis of indeterminate potential as a possible precursor state of MPN. Insight into the pathogenesis as well as options for the treatment of MPN has increased in the last years thanks to modern sequencing technologies and functional studies. Mutational analysis provides information on the oncogenic driver mutations in JAK2, CALR, or MPL in the majority of MPN patients. In addition, molecular markers enable more detailed prognostication and provide guidance for therapeutic decisions. While JAK2 inhibitors represent a standard of care for MF and resistant\/refractory PV, allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation remains the only therapy with a curative potential in MPN so far but is reserved to a subset of patients. Thus, novel concepts for therapy are an important need, particularly in MF. Novel JAK2 inhibitors, combination therapy approaches with ruxolitinib, as well as therapeutic approaches addressing new molecular targets are in development. Current standards and recent advantages are discussed in this review.","62":"","63":"For several decades, the treatment of haemophilia has relied on factor replacement therapy, which restores haemostasis by replacing the missing coagulation factor. In recent years, novel alternative therapies for the treatment of haemophilia in patients with and without inhibitors have been developed. These emergent therapies promote haemostasis by mimicking coagulation factors or inhibiting natural anticoagulants. They provide a less invasive route of administration (i.e. subcutaneous) and some offer reduced frequency of dosing (i.e. every 2 weeks, monthly) compared with the majority of factor replacement therapies, and thus have the potential to simplify treatment, increase adherence and subsequently improve outcomes for patients. Their introduction has transformed the care of haemophilia patients with inhibitors to factor VIII, with similar expectation for haemophilia B patients with inhibitors. However, these therapies also come with several new challenges including their limitation to prophylactic treatment, the observed increased incidence of thrombosis, or their impact on the natural history of the disease and potential disruption of existing treatment guidelines like the use of immune tolerance induction. Moreover, questions remain regarding the long-term impact of non-replacement therapies on joint health as well as the optimal strategy to manage breakthrough bleeds in patients with inhibitors.","64":"The clinical spectrum of patients with coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) ranges from asymptomatic cases to severe pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome.

However, it is becoming increasingly clear that platelets play a role not only in hemostasis but also in immune response, inflammation and allergy, atherosclerosis, and cancer development, and MMPs seem to contribute importantly to this role.

DIC is common in patients with acute leukemia, with prevalence ranging from 17 to 100% in acute promyelocytic leukemia (APL) and 8.5 to 25% in acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-APL acute myeloid leukemia (AML). The pathophysiology is complex and varies between the leukemia subtypes, and is not fully reflected by the laboratory markers currently used to classify DIC. Similarly, the clinical consequence of DIC in acute leukemia also varies across the types of leukemia. DIC is primarily associated with bleeding in APL, while thrombosis is the dominant phenotype in ALL and non-APL AML. The cornerstone of managing DIC is the treatment of the underlying disease, as exemplified by the important role of early administration of all-trans retinoic acid in APL. Other aspects of management focus on supportive care aimed at minimizing the risk of bleeding, via transfusion of blood products. The use of blood products is more liberal in APL, due to the hemorrhagic phenotype and unacceptably high rates of early hemorrhagic death. This review will focus on the pathophysiology, risk factors, clinical implications, and the management of DIC in patients across the spectrum of acute leukemias.","73":"Platelet disorders comprise heterogeneous diseases featured by reduced platelet counts and\/or impaired platelet function causing variable bleeding symptoms. Despite their bleeding diathesis, patients with platelet disorders can develop transient or permanent prothrombotic conditions that necessitate prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation. Anticoagulation in patients with platelet disorders is a matter of concern because the bleeding risk could add to the hemorrhagic risk related to the platelet defect. This review provides an overview on the evidence on anticoagulation in patients with acquired and inherited thrombocytopenia and\/or platelet dysfunction. We summarize tools to evaluate and balance bleeding- and thrombotic risks and describe a practical approach on how to manage these patients if they have an indication for prophylactic or therapeutic anticoagulation.","74":"Despite advances in anticoagulant therapy, thrombosis remains the leading cause of morbidity and mortality worldwide. Heparin and vitamin K antagonists (VKAs), the first anticoagulants to be used successfully for the prevention and treatment of thrombosis, are associated with a risk of bleeding. These agents target multiple coagulation factors. Thus, by activating antithrombin, heparin mainly inhibits factor Xa and thrombin, whereas VKAs lower the levels of the vitamin K-dependent clotting factors. Direct oral anticoagulants, which have replaced VKAs for many indications, inhibit only factor Xa or thrombin. Although the direct oral anticoagulants are associated with less bleeding than VKAs, bleeding remains their major side effect. Epidemiological and animal studies have identified factor XI as a target for potentially safer anticoagulant drugs because factor XI deficiency or inhibition protects against thrombosis and is associated with little or no bleeding. Several factor XI-directed strategies are currently under investigation. This article (1) reviews the rationale for the development of factor XI inhibitors, (2) identifies the agents in most advanced stages of development, (3) describes the results of completed clinical trials and provides a summary of those underway, and (4) highlights the opportunities and challenges for this next generation of anticoagulants.","75":"","76":"","77":null,"78":null,"79":"Spontaneous intra-abdominal hemorrhage is very rare in hemophilia A patients.

The main topic this review aims to cover is the proinflammatory effects and side effects of platelet transfusion. Platelets prepared for transfusion are subject to stress injury upon collection, preparation, and storage. With these types of stress, they undergo morphologic, metabolic, and functional modulations which are likely to induce platelet activation and the release of biological response modifiers (BRMs). As a consequence, platelet concentrates (PCs) accumulate BRMs during processing and storage, and these BRMs are ultimately transfused alongside platelets. It has been shown that BRMs present in PCs can induce immune responses and posttransfusion reactions in the transfusion recipient. Several recent reports within the transfusion literature have investigated the concept of platelets as immune cells. Nevertheless, current and future investigations will face the challenge of encompassing the immunological role of platelets in the scope of transfusion.","82":"The recommended treatment for patients with venous thromboembolism (VTE) is anticoagulation for at least 3 months. However, anticoagulant treatment increases the risk of bleeding, and patients at high risk for major bleeding might benefit from treatment discontinuation. In this review, we discuss strategies for assessing bleeding risk and compare different bleeding risk tools. Bleeding risk assessment is best viewed as a continuous approach with varying challenges throughout the acute and chronic phase. At diagnosis, bleeding risk factors must be identified and reversible risk factors treated or modified. After initial treatment, repeated bleeding risk assessment is crucial for the decision on extended\/long-term anticoagulation. Current clinical prediction models (e.g., HAS-BLED, RIETE, or VTE-BLEED scores) are externally validated tools with relevant differences in specificity and sensitivity, which can aid in clinical decision-making. Unfortunately, none of the current bleeding risk assessment tools has been investigated in clinical trials and provides evidence to withhold anticoagulation treatment based on the score. Nevertheless, the HAS-BLED or RIETE score can be used to identify patients at high risk for major bleeding during the initial treatment phase, while the VTE-BLEED score might be used to identify patients at low risk for bleeding and, therefore, to safely administer extended\/long-term anticoagulation for secondary thromboprophylaxis. As clinical prediction scores still lack predictive value, future research should focus on developing biomarker-based risk assessment models.","83":"The therapeutic landscape of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is rapidly changing with the recent availability of new targeted therapies. This progressive shift from empiricism to pathophysiology-based treatments reflects an intensive interaction between the continuous findings in the field of basic science and an efficient collaborative clinical research and represents a convincing example of the strength of translational medicine. Despite the rarity of TTP, national and international efforts could circumvent this limitation and shed light on the epidemiology, clinical presentation, prognosis, and long-term outcome of this disease. Importantly, they also provided high-quality results and practice changing studies for the benefit of patients. We report here the most recent therapeutic findings that allowed progressively improving the prognostic of TTP, both at the acute phase and through long-term outcome.","84":"","85":"Physiological fibrinolysis under normal conditions progresses slowly, in contrast to coagulation which is triggered rapidly to stop bleeding and defend against microbial invasion. Methods to detect fibrinolysis abnormalities are less simple and poorly standardized compared with common coagulation tests. Fibrinolysis can be accelerated by preparing euglobulin from plasma to reduce endogenous inhibitors, or by adding plasminogen activators to normal plasma. However, these manipulations complicate interpretation of results and diagnosis of a \"fibrinolysis deficit.\" Many observational studies on antigen levels of fibrinolysis inhibitors, plasminogen activator inhibitor 1 or thrombin-activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor, zymogen or active enzyme have been published. However, conclusions are mixed and there are clear problems with harmonization of results. Viscoelastic methods have the advantage of being rapid and are used as point-of-care tests. They also work with whole blood, allowing the contribution of platelets to be explored. However, there are no agreed protocols for applying viscoelastic methods in acute care for the diagnosis of hyperfibrinolysis or to direct therapy. The emergence of SARS-CoV-2 and the dangers of associated coagulopathy provide new challenges. A common finding in hospitalized patients is high levels of D-dimer fibrin breakdown products, indicative of ongoing fibrinolysis. Well-established problems with D-dimer testing standardization signal that we should be cautious in using results from such tests as prognostic indicators or to target therapies.","86":null,"87":"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) is a severe, immune-mediated, adverse drug reaction that paradoxically induces a prothrombotic state.

In this short review, the different perioperative strategies to run cardiopulmonary bypass will be summarized.","88":"Myeloproliferative neoplasms (MPNs) are clonal disorders of the hematopoietic stem cell. Classical BCR\/ABL-negative MPNs include polycythemia vera (PV), essential thrombocythemia (ET), and primary myelofibrosis (PMF). Thrombotic events are a major cause of morbidity and mortality in these patients. Pathogenesis of blood clotting activation involves various abnormalities of platelets, erythrocytes, and leukocytes, as well as dysfunctions of endothelial cells. Patients with MPN can be stratified in \"high risk\" or \"low risk\" of thrombosis according to established risk factors. ET and PV clinical management is highly dependent on the patient's thrombotic risk, and a risk-oriented management strategy to treat these diseases is strongly recommended. In this review, we give an overview of risk factors, pathogenesis, and thrombosis prevention and treatment in MPN.","89":"Active cancer causes approximately 25% of all acute events of venous thromboembolism (VTE). While most of the cancer diagnoses are known or clinically apparent at the time of VTE, care providers and patients may be worried about the 3 to 8% risk of occult cancer occurring in the year after VTE. Several studies have compared limited to extensive cancer screening after acute VTE, especially with the addition of abdominal computed tomography (CT) or whole-body PET-CT, with the hope to shorten the time to cancer diagnosis and lead to less advanced cancer stages. These studies have not shown improved clinical outcomes with an extensive screening, and have led to current recommendations of limited screening for cancer in patients with acute VTE, including unprovoked cases. Several risk assessment models have been developed to identify patients at greatest risk of occult cancer, however, with low discriminative performances and no current clinical usefulness. Some clinical situations may empirically deserve a more thorough cancer screening, such as unprovoked upper extremity deep vein thrombosis (DVT), bilateral leg DVT, descending leg DVT, or recurrent VTE during anticoagulation.","90":"Preventing thromboembolic events, while minimizing bleeding risks, remains challenging when managing patients with atrial fibrillation. Despite large and successful trial programs, several clinical concerns remain which commonly relate to fears of over- or underexposure to drugs and unfavorable outcomes.

In vitro studies have shown that platelets, which come into contact with proteins such as fibrinogen, spread and first form filopodia and then lamellipodia, the latter being plate-like protrusions with branched actin filaments. However, the role of platelet lamellipodia in hemostasis and thrombus formation has been unclear until recently.

Although the pathogenesis of ITP is still not completely elucidated, it is largely recognized that the low platelet count observed in ITP patients is due to multiple alterations of the immune system leading to increased platelet destruction as well as impaired thrombopoiesis. The clinical manifestations and patients' response to different treatments are very heterogeneous suggesting that ITP is a group of disorders sharing common characteristics, namely, loss of immune tolerance toward platelet (and megakaryocyte) antigens and dysfunctional primary hemostasis. Management of ITP is challenging and requires intensive communication between patients and caregivers. The decision to initiate treatment should be based on the platelet count level, age of the patient, bleeding manifestation, and other factors that influence the bleeding risk in individual patients.

Hepatocytes are targeted by gene therapy protocols to treat hemophilia A. However, the hepatocyte is not the natural site for FVIII synthesis and current gene therapy protocols are eliciting immune responses that require immune suppression with corticosteroid therapy in a fairly high proportion of patients over a significant period of time.

The two available brands TEG (thromboelastography) and ROTEM (rotational thromboelastometry) provide devices that are either manually operated or fully automated. The automation allows for the assays to be used as point-of-care tests increasing their usefulness in massively bleeding patients with rapidly changing hemostatic profiles. While the number of research papers on the subject and the number of published treatment algorithms increase rapidly, the influence of the use of these devices on patient outcome needs yet to be established. In this article, we first review the technology of these devices and the parameters provided by the assays.

Bleeding manifestations are highly variable among FXI-deficient patients and FXI replacement therapy can be associated with an increased thrombotic risk. A correct evaluation of the patient hemostatic potential is crucial to prevent under- or overtreatment. In recent years, different research groups have investigated the use of global coagulation assays as alternative for studying the role of FXI in hemostasis and identifying the clinical phenotype of FXI deficiency.

To make an accurate diagnosis, constitutional platelet dysfunction (CPDF) should be considered once von Willebrand disease and drug intake are ruled out. CPDF may be associated with thrombocytopenia or a genetic syndrome. CPDF diagnosis is complex, as no single test enables the analysis of all aspects of platelet function. Furthermore, the available tests lack standardization, and repeat tests must be performed in specialized laboratories especially for mild and moderate forms of the disease. In this review, we provide an overview of the laboratory tests used to diagnose CPDF, with a focus on light transmission platelet aggregation (LTA), flow cytometry (FC), and granules assessment. Global tests, mainly represented by LTA, are often initially performed to investigate the consequences of platelet activation on platelet aggregation in a single step. Global test results should be confirmed by additional analytical tests. FC represents an accurate, simple, and reliable test to analyze abnormalities in platelet receptors, and granule content and release. This technique may also be used to investigate platelet function by comparing resting- and activated-state platelet populations. Assessment of granule content and release also requires additional specialized analytical tests. High-throughput sequencing has become increasingly useful to diagnose CPDF. Advanced tests or external research laboratory techniques may also be beneficial in some cases.","121":null,"122":"","123":"Computational physiology, i.e., reproduction of physiological (and, by extension, pathophysiological) processes in silico, could be considered one of the major goals in computational biology. One might use computers to simulate molecular interactions, enzyme kinetics, gene expression, or whole networks of biochemical reactions, but it is (patho)physiological meaning that is usually the meaningful goal of the research even when a single enzyme is its subject. Although exponential rise in the use of computational and mathematical models in the field of hemostasis and thrombosis began in the 1980s (first for blood coagulation, then for platelet adhesion, and finally for platelet signal transduction), the majority of their successful applications are still focused on simulating the elements of the hemostatic system rather than the total (patho)physiological response in situ.

The procedure can also be performed in platelet-rich plasma by omitting exogenous phospholipids. TG is thought to mimic more than other coagulation procedures the process that occurs in vivo. Over the years, TG has been used to investigate coagulation mechanisms, which were not completely understood, or to investigate hyper- or hypocoagulability in clinical conditions known to be at increased risk of thrombosis or hemorrhage, respectively. More recently, TG has been employed as a laboratory tool to assess the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism or to assess the risk of arterial thromboembolism in specific clinical settings or in the general population.

In this narrative review, we will present the latest evidence to better understand hemostatic mechanisms of preeclampsia, as well as in women with placenta-mediated pregnancy complications and inherited thrombophilia or antiphospholipid antibodies. Using four clinical scenarios, the mixed results of preventive efforts through the use of antithrombotic drugs (aspirin, heparin) will be discussed. We will also review knowledge gaps and ongoing research.","135":"Since the earliest works on the understanding of different forms of pulmonary hypertension, thrombosis has been involved in the pathophysiology of the disease, both in pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH) and in chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). Autopsy and then pathophysiological data paved the way for the use of anticoagulants as a treatment for PAH and CTEPH. In PAH their role has diminished with the advent of specific targeted therapies, but they are still prescribed in more than half of PAH patients, because of concomitant venous thromboembolism or atrial fibrillation. In CTEPH long-term anticoagulant therapy is the cornerstone of the management. The recent development of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs) raises the question of the best anticoagulation strategy, both in patients with PAH and in patients with CTEPH. In this review, we present an overview of the history of anticoagulants in the management of patients suffering from PAH or CTEPH, an update of the available data on the underlying rationale of their use in these subjects, an alert on the potential risks of using DOACs in these poorly explored situations, and the setting up of dedicated trials to evaluate the best anticoagulant treatment strategies in patients suffering from PAH or CTEPH.","136":"Cytoskeleton is composed of more than 100 proteins and represents a dynamic network of the cellular cytoplasm. Cytoskeletal functions include spatial organization of cellular components, structural connection of the cell with external environment, and biomechanical force generation. Cytoskeleton takes part, at different levels, in all phases of platelet biogenesis: megakaryocyte (MK) differentiation, MK maturation, and platelet formation. In addition, it also plays a major role in each stage of platelet function. Inherited platelet disorders (IPDs) are a group of rare diseases featured by low platelet count and\/or impaired platelet function. Over the past decade, the investigation of platelet biomechanics has become a major and highly relevant theme of research due to its implications at every stage of development of human life. The initial use of diverse biophysical techniques (e.g., micropipette aspiration, atomic force and scanning ion conductance microscopy, real-time deformability cytometry) started unraveling biomechanical features of platelets that are expected to provide new explanations for physiological and pathological mechanisms. Although the impact of cytoskeletal alterations has been largely elucidated in various IPDs' pathogenesis, the understanding of their impact on biomechanical properties of platelets represents an unmet need. Regarding IPDs, improving biomechanical studies seems promising for diagnostic and prognostic implications. Potentially, these characteristics of platelets may also be used for the prediction of bleeding risk. This review addresses the current available methods for biophysical investigations of platelets and the possible implementations in the field of IPDs.","137":"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a rare, relapsing, and life-threatening disorder with an annual incidence of 10 cases per million people. TTP is a thrombotic microangiopathy characterized by severe thrombocytopenia, microangiopathic hemolytic anemia, and organ ischemia. The disease is caused by a severe deficiency of the enzyme ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloprotease with thrombospondin type 1 repeats, member 13), which can either be acquired, mainly by autoantibodies targeting ADAMTS13, or congenital due to mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene. Thanks to the establishment of national registries worldwide, fundamental and translational research, major advances have been made on the diagnosis, treatment, and fundamental understanding of TTP, since the description of the first TTP case almost 100 years ago. The introduction of therapeutic plasma exchange in the 1970s has significantly improved patient survival, but novel diagnostic assays, targeted treatments (rituximab, caplacizumab, recombinant ADAMTS13), and the unraveling of both ADAMTS13 function and TTP pathophysiology should help to further improve the patients' quality of life. However, differential diagnosis of TTP remains challenging and still a lot of questions remain unanswered to completely understand this rare and devastating disease.","138":"Hemophilia A (HA) and B (HB) are X-linked bleeding disorders caused by mutations in the F8 or F9 gene that result in the absence, or reduced activity, of the corresponding clotting factor. The severity of bleeding and related complications is proportional to the amount of residual circulating functional factor. The development of a safe and effective hemophilia treatment lasted several decades and has been mainly based on clotting factor replacement. Advances in the engineering and manufacturing of clotting concentrates have led to the widespread availability of extended half-life products that reduced the number of intravenous infusions needed to achieve adequate trough levels. The recent development of new nonfactor replacement treatments and biotechnology techniques has offered therapeutic alternatives for hemophilia patients with and without inhibitors. These are characterized by an easier route of administration, low immunogenicity, and, regarding gene therapy and cell-based treatments, potential long-term protection from bleeding after a single treatment course. In this review, we analyze recent progresses in the management of hemophilia and discuss opportunities and challenges.","139":"Septic thrombophlebitis (STP) is a complex, cross-disciplinary clinical condition that combines a localized infection with a neighboring venous thrombosis. STP can occur at several possible anatomic sites, such as dural sinuses, jugular vein (Lemierre syndrome), portal vein (pylephlebitis), and pelvic veins. Its high mortality in the preantibiotic era improved considerably with the introduction of modern antibiotics. However, little evidence exists to date to guide its clinical management. The incidence of STP or its risk factors may be increasing, and its mortality may still be considerable. These trends would have far-reaching implications, especially in the setting of increasing resistance to antimicrobial agents. No clinical assessment tools exist to support patient screening or guide treatment in STP. Few interventional studies exist on the efficacy and safety of anticoagulation. Recommendations on its indications, duration, and the agents of choice are mostly based on evidence derived from small observational studies. While all forms of STP pose similar challenges, future research may benefit from the distinction between bacteria-associated, virus-associated, and mycosis-associated thrombophlebitis. Addressing these gaps in evidence would enhance our ability to diagnose this condition and treat patients effectively.","140":"Given the aging population, the burden of age-dependent diseases is growing. Despite this, elderly patients are often underrepresented in clinical trials and little data are available on current anticoagulant management and outcomes in this unique population, especially those aged 90 years or older. There is uncertainty, and a fear of \"doing harm,\" that often leads to de-prescription of antithrombotic agents in nonagenarian patients. Decision-making concerning the use of anticoagulant treatment needs to balance the risk of thrombotic events against the risk of major bleeding, especially intracranial hemorrhage. In this perspective, the development of direct oral anticoagulants (DOACs), acting as direct and selective inhibitors of a specific step or enzyme of the coagulation cascade, has dramatically changed oral anticoagulant treatment. In fact, given the lower incidence of intracranial hemorrhage, the favorable overall efficacy and safety, and the lack of routine monitoring, DOACs are the currently recommended anticoagulant agents for the treatment of both atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism even in very elderly patients. However, given the limited data available on the management of anticoagulation in nonagenarians, a few unanswered questions remain. In this review, we focused on recent evidence for anticoagulant treatment in atrial fibrillation and venous thromboembolism along with management of anticoagulation-related bleeding in nonagenarians.","141":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. Accuracy of diagnosis is thus of vital importance. Failure to diagnose VTE increases the risk of progression and complications. Conversely, anticoagulation as a result of an incorrect diagnosis exposes patients to the associated hazards of bleeding. The diagnostic management of recurrent deep vein thrombosis (DVT) and postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) is especially challenging due to the lack of well-established diagnostic standards. Particularly, the differentiation between the two is notoriously difficult as symptoms, clinical signs, and diagnostic test findings largely overlap. This review highlights the current diagnostic and management strategies for recurrent DVT and PTS with a focus on clinical findings and imaging modalities. We also discuss current open questions for clinicians in the field, anticipating future directions and predictions for the year 2050.","142":"A strong link between cancer and thrombosis has been well recognized. The occurrence of venous thromboembolism (VTE) can be the first clinical sign of an undiagnosed (i.e., occult) cancer. Cancer is more often diagnosed after unprovoked compared with provoked VTE events, with a reported risk in recent studies of around 5%. Extensive, imaging-based screening strategies to detect occult cancer after unprovoked VTE do not appear to have a clear clinical benefit compared with a more limited cancer screening. To identify patients with unprovoked VTE at high risk of occult cancer, risk factors have been explored and prediction models developed. Relevant risk factors for occult cancer include male sex, age, anemia, chronic lung disease, and thrombocytosis. Studies with preselection of patients based on risk assessment and evaluation of limited versus extensive screening strategies are currently ongoing. Also, novel and promising approaches for early detection of cancer in patients with unprovoked VTE by means of liquid biopsies, which include analysis of circulating tumor cells, cell-free tumor DNA, proteomics, or platelet mRNA sequencing, are currently under investigation. In this review, we provide an overview of the risk of cancer diagnosis after VTE, discuss the studies which investigated different screening strategies for occult cancer, summarize risk factors and risk scoring models for identification of patients at high risk of cancer diagnosis after VTE, and highlight ongoing research to optimize screening and identification of patients at risk of occult cancer, which will shape the future clinical practice.","143":"","144":"","145":"Congenital haemophilia A (HA) is caused by deficiency of coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) activity, leading to spontaneous or traumatic bleeding events. While FVIII replacement therapy can treat and prevent bleeds, approximately 30% of patients with severe HA develop inhibitor antibodies that render FVIII replacement therapy ineffective. The bypassing agents (BPAs), activated prothrombin complex concentrate (aPCC) and recombinant activated FVII, first approved in 1977 and 1996, respectively, act to generate thrombin independent of pathways that involve factors IX and VIII. Both may be used in patients with congenital haemophilia and inhibitors (PwHIs) for the treatment and prevention of acute bleeds and quickly became standard of care. However, individual patients respond differently to different agents. While both agents are approved for on-demand treatment and perioperative management for patients with congenital haemophilia with inhibitors, aPCC is currently the only BPA approved worldwide for prophylaxis in PwHI. Non-factor therapies (NFTs) have a mechanism of action distinct from BPAs and have reported higher efficacy rates as prophylactic regimens. Nonetheless, treatment challenges remain with NFTs, particularly regarding the potential for synergistic action on thrombin generation with concomitant use of other haemostatic agents, such as BPAs, for the treatment of breakthrough bleeds and in perioperative management. Concomitant use of NFTs with other haemostatic agents could increase the risk of adverse events such as thromboembolic events or thrombotic microangiopathy. This review focuses on the origins, development and on-going role of aPCC in the evolving treatment landscape in the management of PwHI.","146":null,"147":"Congenital fibrinogen disorders (CFDs) encompass a heterogeneous group of fibrinogen defects with a wide spectrum of biological and clinical features. An accurate diagnosis is thus essential to assure the optimal management for the patient. Diagnosis involves a multistep approach starting with routine coagulation assays and assessment of functional and antigenic fibrinogen followed by identification of the molecular anomaly. However, the diagnosis of CFD can be challenging as the sensitivity and specificity of coagulation assays depend on the fibrinogen level as well as on the fibrinogen variant. In addition, patients suffering from CFD have a heterogeneous clinical course which is often unpredictable by routine coagulation assays. To better determine the patient's clinical phenotype, global hemostasis assays and an assessment of the fibrin clot properties are performed in research laboratories. In this review, we summarize the fibrinogen work-up highlighting some common pitfalls and provide an update of the research on CFD.","148":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a major cause of maternal morbidity during pregnancy and the postpartum period. Because there is a lack of adequate study data, management strategies for the prevention of VTE during pregnancy have mainly been deduced from case-control and observational studies and extrapolated from recommendations for non-pregnant patients. The decision for or against pharmacologic thromboprophylaxis must be made on an individual basis weighing the risk of VTE against the risk of adverse side effects such as severe bleeding complications. A comprehensive, multidisciplinary approach is often essential as the clinical scenario is made more complex by the specific obstetric context, especially in the peripartum period. As members of the Working Group in Women's Health of the Society of Thrombosis and Haemostasis (GTH), we summarize the evidence from the available literature and aim to establish a more uniform strategy for VTE risk assessment and thromboprophylaxis in pregnancy and the puerperium. In this document, we focus on women with hereditary thrombophilia, prior VTE and the use of anticoagulants that can safely be applied during pregnancy and the lactation period.","149":"von Willebrand factor (VWF) represents a large and complex adhesive plasma protein whose main function is to provide a bridge between blood platelets and damaged endothelium, and thus facilitate primary hemostasis. VWF also binds to FVIII, preventing early proteolysis, and delivers this cargo to sites of vascular injury, thereby promoting clot formation and secondary hemostasis. An absence, deficiency, or defect in VWF can lead to a bleeding diathesis called von Willebrand disease (VWD), considered the most common inherited bleeding disorder. Contemporary laboratory assays used in VWD diagnosis\/exclusion comprise a myriad of assays that identify the quantity (level) of VWF, as well as the multitude of VWF activities. These may use the following test abbreviations: VWF:Ag, VWF:RCo, VWF:CB, VWF:GPIbR, VWF:GPIbM, VWF:FVIIB, VWF:Ab.

ADP, either derived from red blood cells or released by platelets themselves, stimulates platelets via two G protein-coupled receptors, P2Y1 and P2Y12. In addition, adenosine triphosphate, also contained in the platelet dense granules, activates the P2X1 cation channel. Each of these receptors plays a specific role during platelet activation and aggregation, with relevance to haemostasis, thrombosis and various inflammatory processes where platelets are involved including chronic responses such as atherosclerosis or acute responses such as sepsis, endotoxaemia or allergic asthma. Finally, platelets also express P2Y14, a receptor activated by released uridine diphosphate glucose. Although devoid of any known role in haemostasis, this receptor seems to play a specific role in neutrophil chemotaxis.","155":"","156":"","157":"","158":"Patients with ventricular assist devices (VADs) and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) suffer from an increased risk for thromboembolic events as well as for hemorrhages. High shear stress in the mechanical device results in acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS), characterized by a loss of high-molecular-weight multimers of von Willebrand factor (VWF) leading to an increased bleeding risk. Onset of AVWS occurs within hours, persists during the whole period of mechanical support, and subsides rapidly after explantation. Patients with the older HeartMate II exhibit more severe AVWS than those with the newer HeartMate III, thanks to lower shear stress in the latter. All ECMO and VAD patients exhibit thrombocytopathia and often thrombocytopenia which further increases the bleeding risk. Etiological models for AVWS are increased cleavage by the metalloproteinase ADAMSTS13, mechanical destruction of VWF, and shear-induced VWF binding to platelets. Platelet secretion defects may be caused by transient platelet activation leading to degranulation. AVWS can be diagnosed by detection of VWF multimers using gel-electrophoresis and functional assays of varying sensitivity (VWF ristocetin cofactor activity, VWF activity, VWF collagen binding). Platelet dysfunction is monitored using light transmission aggregometry and secretion defects are detectable using flow cytometry. Modest use of anticoagulants and a target-controlled therapy based on VWF parameters and other coagulation and platelet parameters are shown to be beneficial in this patient group. Persistent hemorrhages may be controlled with tranexamic acid and platelet concentrates. Prompt weaning from the device, when indicated, is the best therapeutic option to prevent recurrent bleeding.","159":"After acute treatment of deep vein thrombosis, not only the risk but also associated side effects of postthrombotic syndrome (PTS) are often underestimated.There are essentially two main types of PTS.1. Obstructive type-no sufficient recanalization of the deep vein.2. Refluctive type-sufficient recanalization of the deep vein, but insufficient venous valves in conjunction with venous reflux.A statement regarding deep vein recanalization and venous valve function can be made at the earliest after 6 months.PTS is often diagnosed without appropriate medical history. However, the assessment of the degree of recanalization and venous reflux is paramount to the medical prognosis. In our opinion, beside proximal thrombosis, sufficient recanalization combined with a strong venous reflux, especially in the popliteal vein, works as a powerful predictor for an unfavorable and fast progression of PTS and chronic venous insufficiency. Thus, the obstructive type is prognostically more favorable. For PTS in general, consistent compression therapy represents the first-line treatment option.With concomitant varicosis, one should assess whether the varicose veins represent primary varicosis with reflux or secondary varicosis without reflux. Especially in the presence of venous ulcers, the elimination of concomitant primary varicosis leads to an improved prognosis. Moist wound treatment is considered to be the standard treatment for all wounds undergoing secondary healing. A standardized set of topical therapeutic agents also facilitates the treatment. In individual cases \"ulcershaving\" and mesh graft transplantation proved to be successful.","160":null,"161":null,"162":null,"163":null,"164":"Preeclampsia complicates up to 8% of pregnancies and is a leading cause of fetomaternal morbidity andmortality. Treatment options are limited, with supportive care and delivery of the placenta representing the cornerstone of current management strategies. Derangements in blood coagulation are wellrecognised in this disorder and appear to favour an increased risk of venous thromboembolism among affected women. This risk appears to be most significant in the postpartum period. The mechanisms underlying this increased thrombosis risk remain to be fully elucidated although increased expression of procoagulant factors, endothelial dysfunction, attenuation of endogenous anticoagulant activity and increased platelet activity have been implicated in the prothrombotic tendency. Preeclampsia is also occasionally complicated by life-threatening haemorrhagic events and current evidence suggests that in some severe manifestations of this disease a coagulopathy with a clinical bleeding tendency may be the predominant haemostatic abnormality. Identifying affected women at significant risk of thrombosis and managing the competing thrombotic and haemorrhagic risks continue to be a significant clinical challenge. Derangements in blood coagulation are also implicated in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia; however, the role of antiplatelet or anticoagulant drugs in the prevention and treatment of this disorder remains a source of considerable debate. In addition, the potential role of specific haemostatic markers as diagnostic or screening tools for preeclampsia has also yet to be determined. Further characterisation of the underlying molecular mechanisms would likely be of major translational relevance and could provide insights into the pathogenesis of this disease as well as the associated haemostatic dysfunction.","165":null,"166":null,"167":"Recently direct-acting oral anticoagulants (DOACs) have become a new therapeutic option besides parenteral anticoagulants to treat cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE).

A questionnaire was presented at several medical educational activities on cancer care and VTE management between August 2018 and January 2019. One hundred fifteen physicians returned their surveys. The two most compelling arguments pro DOAC were when the patient had no chemotherapy and when he expressed unwillingness to apply injections. The two most important arguments against DOACs were if the patient had problems with taking oral medications or when he had a history of severe bleeding.

Over recent years low-dose rIL-2 has been studied for the treatment of autoimmune diseases and acute coronary syndrome because of its ability to expand and activate T regulatory (Treg) cells. However, several medical conditions potentially benefiting from rIL-2 administrations are characterized by an intrinsic prothrombotic risk, thus requiring concurrent anticoagulation. In our systematic review of the literature, we investigated the potential for drug interactions between oral anticoagulants and rIL-2 by assessing the influence of rIL-2 administration on transporters and cytochromes determining the pharmacokinetics of (direct) oral anticoagulants. We extracted data from 12 studies, consisting of 11 animal studies and one study in humans. Eight studies investigated the pharmacokinetics of P-glycoprotein (P-gp) substrates and reported that the intraperitoneal rIL-2 administration may inhibit intestinal P-gp. Four studies on hepatic cytochrome P450 yielded conflicting results. The only human study included in this systematic review concluded that rIL-2 suppresses the hepatic cytochrome P450, but only if given at higher doses. Based on the results from animal studies, the co-administration of rIL-2 and dabigatran etexilate, a substrate of intestinal P-gp, may lead to higher dabigatran plasma concentrations and bioavailability.

AF trials showed that the relative benefits of direct OACs (DOACs) also applied to elderly patients, and due to their higher risk this translates into a higher absolute risk reduction compared with vitamin K antagonists, suggesting that DOACs are the better choice. All DOACs-at varying extent-are eliminated via the kidney and it is crucial to evaluate renal function at initiation and during follow-up, especially for dabigatran. The fear of falls is a common reason against OAC. However, there is still a benefit with OAC, particularly with DOACs given the lower risk of intracranial hemorrhage. Polypharmacy represents a common challenge, nevertheless DOACs and warfarin were classified as beneficial. Nonetheless, attempts should be undertaken to reduce comedication, and drug-drug interactions should be assessed. Coadministration of platelet inhibitors increases bleeding risk and should be avoided. In conclusion, elderly and frail patients requiring anticoagulation for AF or VTE are at higher risk of adverse outcomes, but also have a higher absolute benefit from OAC.

APC is an important regulator of blood coagulation, cleaving and inactivating not only FV\/FVa but also activated factor VIII (FVIIIa). In FVa, APC cleaves several sites, Arg506 (R506) being one of them. The R506Q mutation results in the APC resistance phenotype and a lifelong hypercoagulable state. A prothrombin gene mutation is another relatively frequent thrombosis risk factor, whereas deficiencies of the anticoagulant proteins antithrombin, protein C, or protein S are less common.

The total count of platelets in the body is finely regulated by the balance between platelet production and destruction. Although the pathogenesis of ITP is still not completely elucidated, it is largely recognized that the low platelet count observed in ITP patients is due to alterations of both mechanisms. An abnormal proliferation of autoreactive T cells leading to the breakdown of immune tolerance to platelet antigens is suggested to be responsible for the up-regulated proliferation of autoantibody producing B cells. Consequently, the immune response induces enhanced T cell-mediated cytotoxicity and antibody-mediated platelet destruction through phagocytosis, complement activation and apoptosis. An additional contribution to the pathophysiology of ITP is given by alterations of thrombopoiesis caused by platelet-reactive autoantibodies or cytotoxic T cells leading to impaired megakaryocyte differentiation and platelet production. All these processes involved in ITP pathophysiology account for the complexity and heterogeneity in the clinical manifestation and therapy responsiveness of this disorder. For this reason, a better understanding of the different underlying mechanisms in ITP is necessary to develop more efficient therapeutic treatments in the future.

Importantly, it has to be realized that the type and heterogeneity of phenotypically relevant mutations determines the method used for testing. Today, most laboratories use either PCR analyses or Sanger sequencing for diagnostic applications. However, increasingly next generation sequencing (NGS) is applied. The clinical use of NGS is still very challenging, but we can expect that the switch to regular application of this method will be coming in the very near future. The price for NGS has gone down to approx. USD 1000,- which makes the routine diagnostic use feasible. Nevertheless, several challenges have yet to be solved, such as the processing of the large data volume as well as storage of the data. Supporting data bases exist already and some will be discussed in the article.

Thrombolytic therapy of neonatal MI includes a chance to completely restore myocardial function. Understanding the resilience of the neonatal heart and mechanism of cardiac cell repair in neonates may spark novel treatment strategies for severe MI in the large number of affected individuals in an aging population.","289":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is a major cause of stroke. The restoration of sinus rhythm through cardioversion, either chemical or electrical is a common practice. Interestingly, there is an incremental increase from the baseline risk for embolisation in the immediate post-cardioversion period, with most events occurring within 10 days from cardioversion. Especially patients with recent onset AF show the lowest rates of antithrombotic therapy, while having a high stroke risk. Despite the increased risk for embolisation, anticoagulation in patients undergoing cardioversion of atrial fibrillation is often inadequate. Moreover, since the implementation of non-vitamin K antagonists oral anticoagulants (DOACs) there are several therapeutic approaches for pericardioversion anticoagulant therapy and not all suits to all patients. In addition, the extensive use of transesophageal echocardiography provides an alternative strategy, especially useful for patients of high haemorrhagic risk.

Key to VWF's function in recruitment of platelets to the site of vascular injury is its multimeric structure. The individual steps of VWF multimer biosynthesis rely on distinct posttranslational modifications at specific pH conditions, which are realized by spatial separation of the involved processes to different cell organelles. Production of multimers starts with translocation and modification of the VWF prepropolypeptide in the endoplasmic reticulum to produce dimers primed for glycosylation. In the Golgi apparatus they are further processed to multimers that carry more than 300 complex glycan structures functionalized by sialylation, sulfation and blood group determinants. Of special importance is the sequential formation of disulfide bonds with different functions in structural support of VWF multimers, which are packaged, stored and further processed after secretion.

They contain a diverse set of proteins that either function in haemostasis, inflammation, or angiogenesis. Biogenesis of the WPB occurs at the Golgi apparatus in a process that is dependent on the main component of the WPB, the haemostatic protein von Willebrand Factor (VWF). During this process the organelle is directed towards the regulated secretion pathway by recruiting the machinery that responds to exocytosis stimulating agonists. Upon maturation in the periphery of the cell the WPB recruits Rab27A which regulates WPB secretion. To date several signaling pathways have been found to stimulate WPB release. These signaling pathways can trigger several secretion modes including single WPB release and multigranular exocytosis. In this review we will give an overview of the WPB lifecycle from biogenesis to secretion and we will discuss several deficiencies that affect the WPB lifecycle.","317":"With the aging of the haemophilia population, age related comorbidities become more and more a medical issue. Managing haemophilia patients with cardiovascular disease is a difficult task for many haemophilia-treating physicians. Over the years, insights on prevalence, risk factors and management of cardiovascular disease in haemophilia have improved substantially. It is now recognised that many risk factors, such as hypertension and overweight, occur quite frequently in patients with haemophilia. Several new insights in anticoagulation management of atrial fibrillation and coronary ischaemia in haemophilia have been suggested. This review provides an general overview of the current knowledge of these topics in literature.","318":"Hepatitis C virus (HCV) represents one of the most common aetiologies of chronic liver disease and causes a major global health burden. Globally an estimated 80 million people are chronically infected, but the majority of whom is still undiagnosed. Prior to the discovery of the virus in 1989 a significant number of patients were exposed and consecutively infected with HCV via contaminated transfusions, as it is a blood-borne disease. Chronic HCV infection pursues a progressive course that ultimately results in the development of cirrhosis, liver failure and hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), if left untreated. The efficiency and tolerability of therapeutical approaches improved considerably with the development of direct-acting antivirals (DAA). The majority of patients treated with the recommended DAA combinations can be cured, which is reflected in achievement of sustained virological response (SVR). This review is intended to provide guidance in the management of patients with chronic hepatitis C, including recommendations for adequate screening, diagnostic procedures, clinical care, treatment and follow-up strategies.","319":null,"320":"Inhibitor development in haemophilia is a serious complication to treatment with factor concentrates. Since the advent of more pure products, especially developed using recombinant DNA technology, some studies have shown an increased incidence of inhibitors in previously untreated patients (PUPs) receiving recombinant products whereas plasma-derived concentrates sometimes have been claimed to have a protective role, probably due to the content of von Willebrand factor (VWF). In fact, experiments indicate that the VWF may block uptake of factor VIII into macrophages for further processing to the immune system. Also, a competition between VWF and inhibitor binding to the C2 domain of factor VIII has been suggested. Recently, large cohort and surveillance studies have created a vigorous debate about the role of product class for inhibitor development as results have been conflicting. The only randomised prospective study, the SIPPET study, was published in 2016, and substantiated previous reports claiming that plasma derived concentrates give less inhibitors in patients with severe haemophilia A, previously not exposed to factor VIII. The debate will continue.","321":"Venous thrombosis (VT) is the third most common cause of cardiovascular death worldwide. Complications from VT and pulmonary embolism are the leading cause of lost disability-adjusted life years. Risks include genetic (e.g., non-O blood group, activated protein C resistance, hyperprothrombinemia) and acquired (e.g., age, surgery, cancer, pregnancy, immobilisation, female hormone use) factors. Pathophysiologic mechanisms that promote VT are incompletely understood, but involve abnormalities in blood coagulability, vessel function, and flow (so-called Virchow's Triad). Epidemiologic studies of humans, animal models, and biochemical and biophysical investigations have revealed contributions from extrinsic, intrinsic, and common pathways of coagulation, endothelial cells, leukocytes, red blood cells, platelets, cell-derived microvesicles, stasis-induced changes in vascular cells, and blood rheology. Knowledge of these mechanisms may yield new therapeutic targets. Characterisation of mechanisms that mediate VT formation and stability, particularly in aging, are needed to advance understanding of VT.","322":"Afibrinogenemia represents the rarest form of fibrinogen deficiency. Causative missense mutations occur rarely and may improve the understanding of fibrinogen structure and function. The propositus was a 26-year-old Argentinian with afibrinogenemia. FGA, FGB and FGG exons and flanking regions were screened by sequencing and the mutant protein was analyzed in silico. A novel missense mutation in the FGB gene (Bbeta Gly272Arg, p.Gly302Arg) was identified. In silico analysis revealed its location in a highly conserved region, which preserves the core fold of the C-terminal beta-chain and is important for proper secretion. A substitution by a positively charged large Arg residue in this area would most likely disturb the core fold by additional interactions with adjacent residues (p.Asp291, p.Asp297, p.Asp311), or by forming of non-native interactions with other proteins, thereby hindering the action of molecular chaperones. Both alternatives would disturb the regular secretion of the beta-chain. The novel missense mutation in the FGB gene causes afibrinogenemia most probably by affecting the secretion of the fibrinogen beta-chain.

So far, only two families with such combination are reported in the literature worldwide supported by genetic background. Evaluation of clinical data, determination of FVIII and FIX levels and genetic analysis of F8 and F9 genes by direct sequencing. We report on a patient having severe haemophilia B (FIX:C &lt;1 IU dl-1) and mild haemophilia A (FVIII:C 18 IU dl-1 ). FIX deficiency was known since childhood, whereas mild haemophilia A was confirmed at the age of 42 due to unexpected bleeding complications after dental extraction despite adequate substitution with plasma derived FIX concentrate. F9 gene analysis showed a point mutation in exon 2 (c.223C&gt;T, p.R75X), whereas F8 gene analysis revealed a point mutation in exon 4 (c.545A&gt;C, p.D182A). The mother of the patient was heterozygous for F8 mutation, but not for F9 mutation suggesting a de novo F9 mutation. Accidentally, further family from Germany with mild Haemophilia A was identified to have the same F8 mutation. F8 Haplotype analysis revealed that the p.D182A mutation most likely represents a founder mutation with common ancestors of the German and the Lithuanian family. Our results confirm the rare event of Haemophilia A and haemophilia B in the same patient originating from two distinct genetic defects in F8 and F9 genes. ","324":"FVIII inhibitors still are the major concern in treatment of haemophilia A patients by FVIII replacement therapy. Immune tolerance induction to reverse inhibitor formation fails in about 30% of treated patients. These patients face increased morbidity and mortality producing a need for new therapy strategies in the treatment of FVIII inhibitor-positive patients. Regulatory T cells are important modulators of the immune response and are also involved in the immune response to FVIII in haemophilia A patients. Additionally, regulatory T cells have been shown to play a role in tolerance induction induced by multiple experimental treatment regimes. This review summarises the current knowledge on the role of regulatory T cells in the immune response to FVIII and tolerance induction strategies. Additionally, possible ways to engineer regulatory T cells as therapeutic agent in haemophilia A and current challenges of regulatory T cell therapies are discussed.","325":"Spontaneous intraabdominal hemorrhage is a very rare event even in patients with bleeding disorders like hemophilia. Nevertheless this rare case must be considered in patients with coagulopathies presenting with abdominal pain. Prompt radiologic imaging and surgical consultation are of highest priority. Here we report on a 20-year-old patient with moderate hemophilia A, who underwent emergency laparotomy for a spontaneous idiopathic bleeding of the omentum majus. There are few cases in the literature on this sort of event in patients with hemophilia, who mostly suffer from spontaneous joint bleedings. These patients require an intensive, interdisciplinary perioperative care, involving haematologists, surgeons, radiologists and anesthesists.

Treatment endpoints differ in clinical research and in clinical practice. The requirement of platelet enhancing drugs needs to be better defined in guidelines. Second-line therapies for children are rarely required and include thrombopoietin-receptor agonists, rituximab, dexamethasone and immunosuppressants. Thrombopoietin-receptor agonists are successful in adult but also in pediatric ITP. The strategical position of splenectomy differs from that in adults. Although effective in children it is less frequently used because of its life-long cumulative risk of infectious diseases and a higher potential of spontaneous remission in ITP, providing a strong argument to defer splenectomy.

Computer software to assist the NPR is crucial, as it facilitates the introduction of the data from a national universe that will be centralized and merged into a unique location, thus ensuring a greater reliability and accuracy of the collected data, avoiding duplication of patients. In Portugal, despite the efforts and recognition of the need of a NPR, just recently the protocol for the establishment of the computer software to support the Portuguese National Registry of Haemophilia and other Congenital Coagulopathies (PorR H&amp;CC) was approved. This paper aims to present this newly developed computerized solution, as well as to report the main variables and information that will be available. The development of this application, which includes a set of socio-demographic, clinical and treatment data, was based on the principles of WFH, and the database that supports the NPR, with anonymized data, is operated and maintained in accordance with the Data Protection Law. Currently, the first data are available on the application.

Healthy neonates show no signs of easy bruising or other bleeding diathesis and no increased tendency to thrombosis for any given stimulus compared to adults. Systemic diseases may affect haemostasis, thus predisposing ill neonates to increased risk for haemorrhagic or thrombotic complications. In hospitalized children, neonates have increased risk of developing thrombosis compared to infants and children, mostly associated with the presence of central venous catheter.

Clinically used antiplatelet drugs seem to follow the rule of an inherent link of improved anti-thrombotic potency with increased risk of bleeding complications. Therefore, there is an ongoing quest to develop drugs that are able to break this link that has prevented many patients from receiving antiplatelet protection and has resulted in substantial mortality and morbidity. We describe a new antiplatelet approach that is based on an recombinant antibody protein, a drug format that has recently attracted major interest. Two unique components are genetically combined in this molecule: 1) The ecto-nucleoside triphosphate diphosphohydrolase NTPDase CD39, which enzymatically degrades ATP and ADP to AMP, which is then further degraded to adenosine by the endothelially expressed CD73. Thereby, the platelet activating ADP is reduced and replaced by the platelet inhibiting adenosine resulting in a strong antiplatelet effect. 2) A single-chain antibody (scFv) that specifically binds to the activated GPIIb\/IIIa receptor and thus allows targeting to activated platelets. The described fusion protein results in strong enrichment of CD39's antiplatelet effect, resulting in potent inhibition of platelet adhesion and aggregation and thrombosis in mice. The activated platelet targeting allows using a low systemic concentration that does not interfere with normal haemostasis and thus does not cause bleeding time prolongation in mice. We describe a new antiplatelet approach that promises to deliver strong localized antithrombotic effects without associated bleeding problems.

Finally, several experimental data and clinical trials suggest possible benefits of anti-platelet drugs on some cancers.

Warfarin has been the only oral anticoagulant for more than 60 years and warfarin-related bleeding is reported to be the most common drug-related cause of emergency hospitalization in elderly Americans. Non-vitamin K oral antagonists were introduced five years ago and compared with warfarin are associated with lower risk of intracranial bleeding, and similar or lower case fatality after major bleeding. Despite their superior safety profile, serious bleeding can occur. Most bleeding can be managed with holding the drug, local measures to control the bleeding and transfusion support as required because the NOACs have a relatively short half life and their anticoagulant effect rapidly dissipates. In patients with ongoing bleeding despite supportive measures and in those with life-threatening bleeding, consideration may be given to the use of general hemostatic agents. Experimental and animal evidence suggests that 3 and 4 factor prothrombin complex concentrates can improve hemostasis in the presence of a NOAC and this is reinforced by anecdotal evidence in humans.

","366":null,"367":"There is emerging evidence that platelets have an important role in inflammation beyond their involvement in hemostasis. Platelets can contribute to inflammatory reactions via crosstalk both with immune cells and endothelial cells. Inflamed vessels are characterized by the presence of activated endothelial cells. These activated endothelial cells upregulate receptors necessary for leukocyte recruitment, but also for the adhesion of platelets. Subsequently, immune cells can bind to platelets through adhesion receptors presented on the platelet surface, thus supporting leukocyte recruitment to the vessel wall. There are several neurological diseases associated with vascular inflammation including multiple sclerosis (MS) and stroke. Increased markers of platelet activation could be demonstrated in patients suffering from MS compared to healthy individuals. Reports from murine models indicate that platelets may be of importance for disease progression and severity by mediating leukocyte recruitment as one potential underlying mechanism. Blocking platelet function disease severity was considerably ameliorated. Moreover, processes of tissue remodelling may be influenced by platelet derived mediators. Whether a role of platelets for vascular inflammation can be extrapolated to further neurological diseases will have to be investigated in further in depth experimental and clinical trials. Platelets and platelet associated mechanisms may offer novel starting points to understand neurovascular diseases from a different point of view and to develop novel approaches to access the disease. ","368":null,"369":"Immune thrombocytopenia (ITP) is an autoimmune bleeding disorder characterized by isolated thrombocytopenia. A dysfunctional proliferation of autoreactive T cells is suggested to be responsible for the loss of tolerance to self-platelet antigens in ITP patients. Autoreactive T cells induce uncontrolled proliferation of autoantibody producing B cells leading to persistent anti-platelet autoimmunity in some ITP patients. The autoimmune response causes an increased destruction of platelets by antibody-mediated phagocytosis, complement activation but also by T cell mediated cytotoxicity. In addition, abnormalities in thrombopoiesis and insufficient platelet production due to antibody or T cell mediated megakaryocyte inhibition and destruction contribute to the pathophysiology of ITP. These various effector cell responses may account for the heterogeneity in the clinical manifestation of ITP and also, to success or failure of different treatment strategies. A better understanding of the mechanisms behind ITP will hopefully allow for better diagnostic and, particularly, therapeutic strategies in the future. ","370":"The clinical link between cancer and thrombosis has been recognized by Armand Trousseau in 1865. It has become clear that activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis plays an important role not only in the pathophysiology of Trousseau's syndrome, but also in the progression of solid malignancies. In particular, tissue factor is critical for both primary tumour growth and haematogenous metastasis. Haemostatic perturbations in cancer patients are, at least in part, controlled by defined genetic events in molecular tumourigenesis, including activating and inactivating mutations of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, respectively. While long-term treatment with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is considered standard therapy for established venous thromboembolism (VTE), pharmacological VTE prophylaxis in ambulatory cancer patients and the management of complex systemic coagulopathies remain a challenge and have to be decided on an individual basis and in a risk-adapted manner. Experimental and preclinical studies further suggest that LMWH may be beneficial in cancer therapy, but this innovative concept has not yet been proven beyond doubt in rigorously designed clinical trials. ","371":"","372":"Since more than 20 years, aspirin is an approved and established first-line antiplatelet medication in cardiovascular prevention. This is partially due to ist unique mode of action which is not shared with any other antiplatelet agent as well by the reliability of its pharmacological efficacy: inhibition of platelet COX-1 and subsequent thromboxane formation in almost every patient. Aspirin acts synergistic with ADP-antagonists in dual antiplatelet therapy of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI) and is also approved for long-term secondary prevention. Patients with atrial fibrillation are an exception and benefit more from anticoagulants. After the introduction of the new oral anticoagulants (NOACs), i.e. direct inhibitors of factor Xa or thrombin formation, there is a renewed discussion about the role of antiplatelet agents, specifically if additional dual antiplatelet treatment is still necessary for an optimum clinical effect or whether one component, such as aspirin might be skipped in favor of other classes of oral antiplatelet agents, such as ADP-antagonists. The available data are insufficient to recommend this because of a low number of studies and a still uncertain benefit\/risk (bleeding) ratio. More research on aspirin as a chemopreventive appears also to be necessary and is going on, in particular in individuals at high-risk for vascular thrombotic diseases (diabetics, preeclampsia, venous thromboembolism).","373":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) in patients with cancer is associated with an increased morbidity and mortality, and its prevention is of major clinical importance. However, the VTE rates in the cancer population vary between 0.5% - 20%, depending on cancer-, treatment- and patient-related factors. The most important contributors to VTE risk are the tumor entity, stage and certain anti-cancer treatments. Cancer surgery represents a strong risk factor for VTE, and medical oncology patients are at increased risk of developing VTE, especially when receiving chemotherapy or immunomodulatory drugs. Also biomarkers have been investigated for their usefulness to predict risk of VTE (e.g. elevated leukocyte and platelet counts, soluble P-selectin, D-dimer, etc.). In order to identify cancer patients at high risk of VTE and to improve risk stratification, risk assessment models have been developed, which contain both clinical parameters and biomarkers. While primary thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight-heparin (LMWH) is recommended postoperatively for a period of up to 4 weeks after major cancer surgery, the evidence is less clear for medical oncology patients. Thromboprophylaxis in hospitalized medical oncology patients is advocated, and is based on results of randomized controlled trials which evaluated the efficacy and safety of LMWH for prevention of VTE in hospitalized medically ill patients. In recent trials the benefit of primary thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients receiving chemotherapy in the ambulatory setting has been investigated. However, at the present stage primary thromboprophylaxis for prevention of VTE in these patients is still a matter of debate and cannot be recommended for all cancer outpatients. ","374":null,"375":null,"376":"This short review addresses immune functions of platelet serotonin. Platelets transport serotonin at a high concentration in dense granules and release it upon activation. Besides haemostatic, vasotonic and developmental modulation, serotonin also influences a variety of immune functions (mediated by different serotonin receptors). First, platelet serotonergic effects are directed against invading pathogens via activation and proliferation of lymphocytes, modulation of cytokine release, and recruitment of neutrophils to sites of acute inflammation by induction of selectin expression on endothelial cells. Second, serotonin levels are elevated in autoimmune diseases, such as asthma or rheumatoid arthritis, and during tissue regeneration after ischemia of myocardium or brain. Specific antagonism of serotonin receptors appears to improve survival after myocardial infarction or sepsis and to attenuate asthmatic attacks in animal models. It will be of great clinical relevance if these findings can be translated into human applications. In conclusion, targeting immune modulatory effects of platelet serotonin may provide novel therapeutic options for common health problems. ","377":"Atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the vascular wall that results from disturbed lipoprotein metabolism and increased oxidative stress. A major consequence of this is lipid peroxidation, which generates a number of breakdown products of membrane lipids that form so called oxidation-specific epitopes (OSE). OSE have been documented in oxidized lipoproteins and on the surface of dying cells and circulating microparticles, and their ability to trigger robust pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic responses has been demonstrated extensively. Recent studies have identified specific OSE as major targets of both cellular and soluble pattern recognition receptors of the innate immune system, including innate natural IgM antibodies. This allows the immune system to identify metabolic waste and mediate important physiological house keeping functions, e.g. by promoting the removal of cellular debris and by neutralizing oxidized molecules. Indeed, innate B1 cells and B1 cell derived natural IgM with specificity for OSE have been shown to protect mice from the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Moreover, OSE-specific natural IgM antibodies bind and neutralize the pro-inflammatory and pro-thrombotic effects of OSE, and low levels of OSE-specific IgM are associated with an increased risk for myocardial infarction. Understanding the molecular components and mechanisms involved in this process, will help identify individuals with increased risk for atherothrombosis and indicate novel points for therapeutic intervention. ","378":"The endothelium is a widely distributed organ system that plays an important role in health and disease. The endothelium is remarkably heterogeneous in structure and function. One vital function of the endothelium is to maintain blood in its fluid state, and to provide controlled haemostasis at sites of vascular injury. In keeping with the theme of endothelial cell heterogeneity, endothelial cells from different sites of the vascular employ different strategies to mediate local haemostatic balance. These differences are sufficient to explain why systemic imbalances of haemostatic components invariably lead to local thrombotic phenotypes. An important goal for the future is to identify diagnostic markers that reflect phenotypic changes at the level of individual vascular beds, and to develop therapies that target one or another site of the vasculature. ","379":"Atherosclerosis and its major complications - myocardial infarction and stroke - remain major causes of death and disability in the United States and world-wide. Indeed, with dramatic increases in obesity and diabetes mellitus, the prevalence and public health impact of cardiovascular diseases (CVD) will likely remain high. Major advances have been made in development of new therapies to reduce the incidence of atherosclerosis and CVD, in particular for treatment of hypercholesterolemia and hypertension. Oxidative stress is the common mechanistic link for many CVD risk factors. However, only recently have the tools existed to study the interface between oxidative stress and CVD in animal models. The most important source of reactive oxygen species (and hence oxidative stress) in vascular cells are the multiple forms of enzymes nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate oxidase (NADPH oxidase). Recently published and emerging studies now clearly establish that: 1) NADPH oxidases are of critical importance in atherosclerosis and hypertension in animal models; 2) given the tissue-specific expression of key components of NADPH oxidase, it may be possible to target vascular oxidative stress for prevention of CVD. ","380":"Chronic kidney disease is an established risk factor for arterial and venous thromboembolism (TE). Whereas the overall risk of TE in moderately decreased kidney function is approximately 2.5-fold higher compared to patients with normal renal function, the risk increase is 5.5-fold in patients with severe renal dysfunction. In patients with renal dysfunction and arterial thrombosis (OR: 4.9), malignancy (OR: 5.8) surgery (OR: 14.0) or thrombophilia (OR: 4.3) the risk to suffer from venous TE is higher compared to the risk associated to the baseline renal dysfunction alone. The treatment options for end-stage renal diseases include hemodialysis, peritoneal dialysis and kidney transplantation. During all treatment modalities thrombotic complications have been described, namely catheter malfunction and shunt thrombosis in patients undergoing hemodialysis in up to 25% of patients, and TE, pulmonary embolism or graft vessel thrombosis in approximately 8% of patients. The reported incidence of reno-vascular thrombosis following renal transplantation leading to hemorrhagic infarction with organ rejection or organ loss varied between 2-12%. Keeping in mind the multifactorial etiology of TE in patients with kidney dysfunction a general screening for thrombophilia in this patient group is not indicated. Selected screening on an individual patient basis should be discussed if the family history for TE is positive or the patient itself had suffered one thrombosis before the onset of the renal disease or multiple TEs during hemodialysis or post kidney transplantation in patients waiting for living donor kidney transplantation. ","381":"Platelet cytoskeletal reorganization is essential for platelet adhesion and thrombus formation in hemostasis and thrombosis. The Rho GTPases RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 are the main players in cytoskeletal dynamics of platelets responsible for the formation of filopodia and lamellipodia to strongly increase the platelet surface upon activation. They are involved in platelet activation and aggregate formation including platelet secretion, integrin activation and arterial thrombus formation. The activity of Rho GTPases is tightly controlled by different proteins such as GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs). GAPs stimulate GTP hydrolysis to terminate Rho signaling. The role and impact of GAPs in platelets is not well-defined and many of the RhoGAPs identified are not known to be present in platelets or to have any function in platelets. The recently identified RhoGAPs Oligophrenin1 (OPHN1) and Nadrin regulate the activity of RhoA, Rac1 and Cdc42 and subsequent platelet cytoskeletal reorganization, platelet activation and thrombus formation. In the last years, the analysis of genetically modified mice helped to gain the understanding of Rho GTPases and their regulators in cytoskeletal rearrangements and other Rho mediated cellular processes in platelets. ","382":null,"383":"Platelet activation at sites of vascular injury is critical for the formation of a hemostatic plug which limits excessive blood loss, but also represents a major pathomechanism of ischemic cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases. Although currently available antiplatelet therapies have proved beneficial in preventing the recurrence of vascular events, their adverse effects on primary hemostasis emphasize the necessity to identify and characterize novel pharmacological targets for platelet inhibition. Increasing experimental evidence has suggested that several major platelet surface receptors which regulate initial steps of platelet adhesion and activation may become promising new targets for antiplatelet drugs due to their involvement in thrombotic and thrombo-inflammatory signaling cascades. This review summarizes recent developments in understanding the function of glycoprotein (GP)Ib, GPVI and the C-type lectin-like receptor 2 (CLEC-2) in hemostasis, arterial thrombosis and thrombo-inflammation and will discuss the suitability of the receptors as novel targets to treat these diseases in humans.","384":"Obesity is a major cause for a spectrum of metabolic syndrome-related diseases that include insulin resistance, type 2 diabetes, and steatosis of the liver. Inflammation elicited by macrophages and other immune cells contributes to the metabolic abnormalities in obesity. In addition, coagulation activation following tissue factor (TF) upregulation in adipose tissue is frequently found in obese patients and particularly associated with diabetic complications. Genetic and pharmacological evidence indicates that TF makes significant contributions to the development of the metabolic syndrome by signaling through G protein-coupled protease activated receptors (PARs). Adipocyte TF-PAR2 signaling contributes to diet-induced obesity by decreasing metabolism and energy expenditure, whereas hematopoietic TF-PAR2 signaling is a major cause for adipose tissue inflammation, hepatic steatosis and inflammation, as well as insulin resistance. In the liver of mice on a high fat diet, PAR2 signaling increases transcripts of key regulators of gluconeogenesis, lipogenesis and inflammatory cytokines. Increased markers of hepatic gluconeogenesis correlate with decreased activation of AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK), a known regulator of these pathways and a target for PAR2 signaling. Clinical markers of a TF-induced prothrombotic state may thus indicate a risk in obese patient for developing complications of the metabolic syndrome.","385":null,"386":"Endothelial cells (ECs) at arterial branching points are physiologically subjected to chronic damage by disturbed blood flow, which triggers a vascular wound healing response. Additional damage by hyperlipidaemia perturbs this delicate balance of endothelial injury and regeneration, and the progressive accumulation of noxious modified lipoproteins leads to macrophage death. Several miRNAs such as miR-92a and miR-712, which modulate EC proliferation and inflammation, are up-regulated by disturbed flow in ECs, and contribute to atherosclerosis. In addition, reduced endothelial levels of miR-126-5p limit the regenerative capacity of ECs, which becomes apparent by insufficient endothelial repair under hyperlipidemic stress. In macrophages, miR-342-5p induces the expression of miR-155 during the progression of atherosclerosis, which promotes inflammatory gene expression and inhibits efferocytosis by targeting Bcl6, thus contributing to necrotic core formation. Deciphering the complex cell- and context-specific effects of miRNAs during vascular wound healing appears essential for the development of miRNA-based therapies of atherosclerosis.","387":"Blood coagulation is essential for hemostasis, however excessive coagulation can lead to thrombosis. Factor XII starts the intrinsic coagulation pathway and contact-induced factor XII activation provides the mechanistic basis for the diagnostic aPTT clotting assay. Despite its function for fibrin formation in test tubes, patients and animals lacking factor XII have a completely normal hemostasis. The lack of a bleeding tendency observed in factor XII deficiency states is in sharp contrast to deficiencies of other components of the coagulation cascade and factor XII has been considered to have no function for coagulation in vivo. Recently, experimental animal models showed that factor XII is activated by an inorganic polymer, polyphosphate, which is released from procoagulant platelets and that polyphosphate-driven factor XII activation has an essential role in pathologic thrombus formation. Cumulatively, the data suggest to target polyphosphate, factor XII, or its activated form factor XIIa for anticoagulation. As the factor XII pathway specifically contributes to thrombosis but not to hemostasis, interference with this pathway provides a unique opportunity for safe anticoagulation that is not associated with excess bleeding. The review summarizes current knowledge on factor XII functions, activators and inhibitors. ","388":"Coronary heart disease and stroke, the deadliest forms of cardiovascular disease (CVD), are mainly caused by atherosclerosis, a chronic inflammatory disease of the artery wall driven by maladaptive immune responses in the vessel wall. Various risk factors for CVD influence this pathogenic process, including diabetes mellitus, hypertension, dyslipidaemia, and obesity. Indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase (IDO), an enzyme catalyzing the rate-limiting step in the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation, is strongly induced by inflammation in several tissues, including the artery wall. An increasing body of evidence indicates that IDO promotes immune tolerance, decreases inflammation, and functions as a homeostatic mechanism against excessive immune reactions. This review provides an overview of the emerging field of the kynurenine pathway of tryptophan degradation in CVD, emphasizing the role of IDO-mediated tryptophan metabolism and its metabolites in the modulation of 'classical' cardiovascular risk factors, such as hypertension, obesity, lipid metabolism, diabetes mellitus, and in the development of atherosclerotic CVD.","389":"Clot formation in the circulation is a physiological mechanism preventing bleeding at sites of loss of vascular integrity. Clot formation may also occur intravascularly under pathological conditions, e.g. leading to myocardial infarction, stroke, and critical limb ischaemia. Clot formation involves activation of the coagulation cascade and of platelets eventually leading to an occlusive clot. In the venous circulation, clots are rich in erythrocytes and fibrin, while in the arterial circulation platelets predominate. Accordingly, drugs have been developed to interfere with the activation of the coagulation and\/or platelets. As several coagulation factors such as factor VII, VIIII, X and thrombin (factor II) are vitamin K-dependent, drugs interfering with the effects of the vitamin (VKAs), i.e. warfarin, marcoumar or sintrom have been used for decades to prevent thromboembolism and embolic stroke. With the advent of selective inhibitors of factor X (apixaban, edoxaban and rivaroxaban) or factor II (dabigratan) the therapeutic spectrum of anti-thrombotic therapy has been expanded. On the other hand, platelet inhibitors such as aspirin and thienopyridines, i.e. clopidogrel, prasugrel, and ticagrelor have extensively been used to treat arterial disease in the coronary, cerebrovascular and peripheral circulation. Individualized antithrombotic therapy considers (1) characteristics of the disease and (2) those of the patient. Such a decision tree first separates \"arterial\" and \"venous\" thrombi. For the prevention of arterial thrombi that occur in acute myocardial infarction and certain forms of stroke and critical limb ischemia, platelet inhibitors are indicated. The first line drug is aspirin which interferes with thromboxane A2 (TXA2) formation and partially inhibits platelet activation. In patients receiving a stent or in acute coronary syndromes (ACS), the combination of aspirin with a thienopyridine is indicated. On the other hand, patients with venous clots should be treated with anticoagulants interfering with the activation of the coagulation cascade. While the longest experiences exist with vitamin K antagonists, the novel oral anticoagulants (NOACs) are at least as effective, but associated with less intracerebral and life-threatening bleeding. VKAs remain the treatment of choice in patients receiving artificial heart valves or with renal failure (in general a GFR of 30 ml\/min\/KG or less). In the remaining patients, current evidence suggests that NOACs should be preferred. The NOACs are well documented in patients with thromboembolism and atrial fibrillation. Whether patients with an acute ACS should receive dual antiplatelet drugs plus a low dose NOAC is a matter of debate, although conceptually it is an attractive concept. In patients after stent implantation with atrial fibrillation, in which a triple therapy with dual antiplatelet drugs and an anticoagulant is indicated, bleeding is an issue. Recent data suggest that administering a thienopyridine plus warfarin (or possibly a NOAC), while at the same time skipping aspirin may be an alternative to avoid severe bleeding and to maintain antithrombotic efficacy. An extensive therapeutic arsenal to interfere with clot formation requires an individualized approach considering the disease condition and co-morbidities of the patient, the anticoagulants' and patient characteristics. This review builds on and extends previous publications of the authors on this topic. ","390":"In atherosclerosis, activated platelets have been recently recognised not only to participate in thrombotic events but also to play an essential role in the development of atherosclerotic lesions. Upon their activation, platelets release several pro-inflammatory mediators including chemokines. Chemokines are key molecules in inflammation as they are able to recruit leukocytes, modulate their activation\/differentiation and control their proliferation\/apoptosis. In this review we will discuss recent findings regarding the specific roles of chemokines released by platelets on leukocytes and their effects on atherosclerosis. ","391":"The chemokine CXCL12 and its receptor CXCR4 form an important axis contributing to cellular functions in homeostasis and disease. In addition, the atypical CXCL12 receptor CXCR7 may shape the availability and function of CXCL12. Further to their role through progenitor cell mobilization, CXCL12 and CXCR4 may affect native atherogenesis by modifying atherosclerosis-relevant cellular functions. This short review intends to provide a concise summary of current knowledge with regards to cell-specific functions of CXCL12 and its receptors CXCR4 and CXCR7 with potential implications for the initiation and progression of atherosclerosis. ","392":"In addition to their well characterized and established role in haemostasis and thrombosis, platelets contribute to the pathogenesis of inflammation. Adenine nucleotides are signalling molecules that regulate the function of virtually every cell in the body, by interacting with P2 receptors. Their important role in inflammation is well established. In the last few years, the pro-inflammatory roles of adenine nucleotides interacting with their platelet P2 receptors has emerged. In particular, it was shown that the platelet P2Y12 receptor for ADP significantly contributed to the pro-inflammatory effects of cysteinyl leukotrienes (CysLT) in experimental models of asthma in mice. More importantly, it was recently shown that P2Y12 variants were associated with lung function in a large family-based asthma cohort and that the P2Y12 antagonist prasugrel tended to decrease bronchial hyper-reactivity to mannitol in patients with allergic bronchial asthma in a randomized, placebo controlled trial. These data strongly suggest that P2Y12 may represent an important pharmacological target for the treatment of patients with allergic bronchial asthma. ","393":"Interventional treatment of aortic valve stenosis by transcatheter aortic valve replacement (TAVR) has become routine practice in elderly and high risk patients in recent years. Similar to other vascular interventional or surgical procedures TAVR carries thrombotic risks such as stroke, myocardial infarction or systemic embolism as well as peri-procedural bleeding risks. These risks comprise the access site, the type of prosthesis, and the individual risk profile of the patient. Not only during the peri-procedural period but also during longterm follow-up the current target population for TAVR procedures carries a high risk for thrombotic events in particular if atrial fibrillation is present. On the other hand side the bleeding risk is also increased in these patients. Thus, to provide the optimal strategy of antithrombotic therapy during and after TAVR remains a clinical challenge. ","394":null,"395":"The timely removal of blood clots and fibrin deposits is essential in the regulation of haemostasis. This is achieved by the fibrinolytic system, an enzymatic process that regulates the activation of plasminogen into its proteolytic form, plasmin. This is a self-regulated event as the very presence of fibrin initiates plasminogen activation on the fibrin surface due to the presentation of exposed C-terminal lysine residues in fibrin that allow plasminogen to position itself via its lysine binding sites and to be more efficiently cleaved by tissue-type plasminogen activator (t-PA). Hence fibrin, the ultimate substrate of plasmin during fibrinolysis, is indeed an essential cofactor in the cascade. What has now come to light is that the fibrinolytic system is not solely designed to eliminate fibrin. Indeed, it is a broad acting system that processes a variety of proteins, including many in the brain where there is no fibrin. So what drives t-PA-mediated plasminogen activation when fibrin is not available? This review will describe the broadening role of the fibrinolytic system highlighting the importance of fibrin and other key proteins as facilitators during t-PA-mediated plasminogen activation.

Lag time, thrombin peak, time to thrombin peak and endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) were analyzed. ROTEM was performed without activator (NATEM) and data for clotting time, alpha angle, clot formation time and maximum clot firmness were correlated with those of thrombin generation. Altogether 132 persons (72 men, 60 women; median age: 48.0 years) were included. There was a positive non-linear correlation for age versus lag time (p &lt; 0.001) and time to peak (p = 0.001), and almost linear correlation for age versus thrombin peak (p = 0.024) and ETP (p = 0.001), although with a moderate regression slope. Regarding ROTEM, there was a positive correlation between age and maximum clot firmness and alpha angle (p = 0.001), but a negative correlation between age and clotting time (p = 0.039). Comparing both assays, thrombin peak and ETP measured with a final tissue factor concentration of 5 pmol\/l correlated significantly with alpha angle and maximum clot firmness. The age-related changes in CAT and ROTEM variables among adults are not linear.

","404":"Although platelets act as central players of haemostasis only their cross-talk with other blood cells, plasma factors and the vascular compartment enables the formation of a stable thrombus. Multiple activation processes and complex signalling networks are responsible for appropriate platelet function. Thus, a variety of platelet function tests are available for platelet research and diagnosis of platelet dysfunction. However, universal platelet function tests that are sensitive to all platelet function defects do not exist and therefore diagnostic algorithms for suspected platelet function disorders are still recommended in clinical practice. Based on the current knowledge of human platelet activation this review evaluates point-of-care related screening tests in comparison with specific platelet function assays and focuses on their diagnostic utility in relation to severity of platelet dysfunction. Further, systems biology-based platelet function methods that integrate global and specific analysis of platelet vessel wall interaction (advanced flow chamber devices) and post-translational modifications (platelet proteomics) are presented and their diagnostic potential is addressed. ","405":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) poses a worldwide health burden affecting millions of people each year. The annual incidence of symptomatic VTE, the collective term used here for deep venous thrombosis, pulmonary embolism or both, is 2-3 per thousand inhabitants. The one-year mortality is 20% after a first VTE. Of the surviving patients 15-25% will experience a recurrent episode of VTE in the three years after the first event. Primary and secondary prevention is key to reducing death and disability from VTE. How to make use of our current knowledge of inherited risk of VTE for primary and secondary disease prevention is not straightforward. This despite the fact that in the past two or three decades we have made major strides in enlarging our understanding of inherited VTE risk, and that new inherited risk factors continue to be identified. For primary prevention of VTE genetic testing is not likely to play a role in the future. Genetic variations also determine recurrence risk, albeit that the effect sizes for individual genetic variations are invariably lower than those for first VTE events. Multilocus genetic risk scores improve risk classification, and it is now possible to stratify patients who have had a first venous thrombosis, into subgroups with a high and low risk of recurrence. Whether this approach can be used to tailor intensity and duration of treatment remains to be established.

While arteriosclerotic lesions have long been recognized as the underlying cause more recent studies suggest that alterations of the blood are also critically involved. Following plaque rupture, adherence of platelets is followed by the formation of a cross-linked fibrin clot. Patients with diabetes exhibit a prothrombotic milieu consisting of hyper reactive platelets, a tight and rigid clot structure which is due to up-regulation of coagulation factors and prolongation of clot lysis. Metabolic alterations as well as inflammatory processes, which are up-regulated in diabetes, are thought to be the main underlying causes. More recently, the complement cascade has emerged as a potential new player in this context with several complement components directly influencing both platelet function and coagulation.

Joint pain was the most common type of pain (92%), remarkably so even in 80% of young patients. Half of the patients received pharmacological therapy for the pain and 46% of the patients received physiotherapy. Priority and sequence of the contacted physicians and therapists for diagnosis and therapy is described.

While coronary artery disease is the leading cause of cardiac complications in diabetics, it is widely recognized that diabetes increases the risk for the development of heart failure independently of coronary heart disease and hypertension. This increased susceptibility of the diabetic heart to develop structural and functional impairment is termed diabetic cardiomyopathy. The number of different mechanisms proposed to contribute to diabetic cardiomyopathy is steadily increasing and underlines the complexity of this cardiac entity. In this review the mechanisms that account for the increased myocardial vulnerability in diabetic cardiomyopathy are discussed.

Dose reductions are recommended for all of these anticoagulants in renal impairment, some are even contraindicated at certain levels of renal impairment. Their benefit over the conventional anticoagulants is preserved if renal dosing is employed. For end-stage renal disease patients specific treatment regimens are required.

While thrombotic complications such as venous thromboembolism are most frequent in every day's practice, cancer patients may also experience severe bleeding symptoms due to complex systemic coagulopathies, including disseminated intravascular coagulation, haemolytic thrombotic microangiopathy, and hyperfibrinolysis. The pathophysiology of Trousseau's syndrome involves all aspects of Virchow's triad, but previous basic research has mainly focused on the cellular and molecular mechanisms underlying blood hypercoagulability in solid cancers and haematological malignancies. In this regard, over-expression of tissue factor (TF), the principal initiator of the extrinsic coagulation pathway, by primary tumour cells and increased shedding of TF-bearing plasma microparticles are critical to both thrombus formation and cancer progression. However, novel findings on intrinsic contact activation in vivo, such as the release of polyphosphates or DNA by activated platelets and neutrophils, respectively, have pointed to additional pathways in the complex pathophysiology of Trousseau's syndrome.

Monocytes, as cells of the innate immunity, are particularly involved in this process. In the last decade, heterogeneity of circulating monocytes has widely been acknowledged, and a recent consensus nomenclature subdivides classical, intermediate and nonclassical monocytes. Accumulating experimental and clinical data suggest a differential, subset-specific contribution of monocytes to the pathology of atherosclerosis.

This type of mutation is typically associated with low (5%) inhibitor risk. In the present retrospective study we analysed the clinical data of 16 haemophiliacs with the T295A missense mutation treated at Bonn Haemophilia Centre. In total, three patients developed inhibitors: two patients experienced low-titer and one high-titer inhibitors. Both patients with low titer inhibitors underwent successful ITI. The third patient, at the age of 81, developed initially low-titer inhibitors (3 BU\/ml) after rFVIII therapy because of knee surgery. He experienced spontaneous multiple large skin haematomas and haemarthrosis. Immunosuppressive therapy was not applicable because of the infectious origin of discitis (Th3-Th4). Immunoadsorption was performed, but the inhibitor titer increased up to 42 BU\/ml nine weeks after termination. A successful treatment of discitis with antibiotics finally allowed a weekly therapy (four times) with rituximab (375 mg\/m(2)). This resulted in a decrease of inhibitor titre to 0.7 BU\/ml eight weeks after the fourth rituximab application. Patient had endogenous FVIII levels of 3-5%. Twelve months after rituximab therapy (after B cells recovery) he relapsed with low-titer inhibitors and therefore was treated with single rituximab dose (375 mg\/m(2)) again. This resulted in his depletion of B cells, measurable endogenous FVIII levels and non measurable inhibitors. This study demonstrated T295A variant to be associated with significantly increased (3\/16 patients, 17%) inhibitor development.","415":"Compared to children of other age groups neonates show an increased thrombotic risk. The acute therapy depends on thrombus age, the localisation of vascular occlusion and the severity of the underlying disease. The treatment of choice is represented by the administration of unfractionated (UFH) or low molecular weight heparin (LMWH). If loss of limbs or organs is imminent, the application of thrombolytic treatment with recombinant tissue-type plasminogen activator (rt-PA) should be considered whilst taking into account the associated bleeding risk. We report on two patients in which thrombolytic therapy has been conducted successfully.

According to case reports, immunosuppressive therapy in addition to high doses of factor IX (FIX) appears to be promising. We report an 18-year-old patient with severe haemophilia B and a FIX inhibitor with a maximum titre of 2.6 Bethesda units and allergic skin reactions to FIX infusions. At 5 years of age, this patient already had a FIX inhibitor with allergic reactions to FIX and activated prothrombin complex concentrate. ITI at 11 years of age with high-dose FIX, dexamethasone, rituximab, mycophenolate mofetil and intravenous immunoglobulins had induced a sustained response until the current presentation. The patient was restarted on the same ITI regimen with aforementioned immunosuppressants, which were initiated one week before high-dose FIX. No allergic reactions, nephrotic syndrome or serious infection occurred during ITI. The FIX inhibitor was undetectable after five weeks of treatment and remained so until 19 months of follow-up. ","418":"Clot waveform analysis extends the interpretation of aPTT measurement curves. The curve is mathematically processed to obtain information about fibrin formation kinetics including semiquantitative determination of thrombin, prothrombinase and tenase activity. In this study the feasibility of clot waveform analysis for monitoring of haemophilia A was investigated using blood samples from healthy controls as well as haemophilia A patients under various clinical conditions. Thrombin, prothrombinase and tenase activity show a high correlation to factor VIII levels. Tenase activity was found to exhibit a linear relationship to factor VIII levels over a very large concentration range and was able to discriminate patients with severe, moderate and mild haemophilia. Clot waveform analysis is an easy, fast and cheap method to access disturbances in clot formation and can be done without any additional measurements beside an aPTT. ","419":"In over two-thirds of deaths, nutrition is a determining factor. Nutritional condition and dietary recommandations are unspecified in the haemophilia treatment. Aim of this study was to examine the food consumption and dietary behaviour in affected patients before and after a nutrition consultation. Data were assessed via questionnaires and compared between 38 patients with haemophilia (PwH) and 20 controls without haemophilia. Furthermore, in a randomised controlled trial 11 patients with haemophilia (PwH-I) took part in an adapted nutrition consultation and were supervised over six months as opposed to 12 patients with haemophilia (PwH-O) without intervention. PwH were compared to controls more pleased with their weight (53 vs. 40%), used more nutrition consultations in the past (53 vs. 15%) and consumed more dairy products (40 vs. 15%) and fruits (45 vs. 30%). After nutrition consultation PwH-I were better informed about their own blood values than PwH-O. The nutrition rated high in both groups, but PwH-I were more mindful of the feeling of satiety (9 vs. 36%) compared to PwH-O (33 vs. 17%). Moreover, PwH-I ate less under stress and\/or out of boredom, showed a higher satisfaction regarding their weight and increased the liquid intake (55 vs. 73%), which remained unchanged in PwH-O with 42%. Compared to PwH-O, PwH-I ate more roughage, low-fat food, fish and fruits, therefore consuming less coffee\/tea. Food consumption and dietary behaviour are similar between patients with haemophilia and controls without haemophilia. A nutrition consultation affected the food consumption and dietary behaviour in patients with haemophilia positively and can consequently contribute to preservation of health and prevention of nutritional diseases.

The aim of thisstudywas to investigatethe myoelectrical signal ofknee jointmusclesin different agestages during upright standing. Surface EMG (SEMG) amplitudes of quadriceps, hamstrings and gastrocnemii were measured in 191 patients with severe haemophilia A (n=164) and B (n=27) while standing on an even surface. After an age-based classification of patients into the subgroups H(A): 17-29 (n = 37), H(B): 30-39 (n = 50), HC: 40-49 (n = 61), H(D): 50-70 in years (n = 43) the clinical WFH score for the ankle and knee joint was determined. To normalize the SEMG values amplitude ratios (percentage of cumulated activity) were calculated with respect to the specific limb. With increasing age, the patient showed descriptively a deterioration of the joint situation. The extensors of the knee joint reached significantly higher absolute and percentage levels in the muscle activity with increasing age (p &lt; 0.05). The absolute amplitude values of the Mm. gastrocnemii showed no differences in the age groups while the relative levels were decreased. The present study shows that patients with increasing age and degree of haemophilic arthropathy develop a modified control strategy during upright standing, in the form of a shift from the plantar flexors to the extensors of the knee joint.","421":"Haemophilic arthropathy is a defining feature and a debilitating condition of persons with haemophilia (PwH) in low resource countries. Orthopaedic surgery is unavoidable for patients with high occurrence of joint damage. We aimed to evaluate the spectrum and outcome of invasive orthopaedic therapies in PwH and von Willebrand diseases (VWD). Our descriptive observational retrospective study included 131 invasive surgical procedures, performed on 76 consecutive patients, most of them (93.4%) with severe disease, treated in Timisoara's Haemophilia Center over a period of 12 years; 17.1% had pre-operation anti-FVIII inhibitors. Invasive elective procedures were predominant (90.8%) as compared to emergency measures (9.2%); according to their invasiveness, 20.6% of interventions were major, 44.3% intermediate and 35.1% minor. Results were good in the majority of cases; significantly reduced joint bleed rate and pain score were the most consistent achievements. The greatest proportion of complications occurred after major (66.7%), compared to moderate (25.6%) and minor (7.7%) interventions. The main threatening complication was the development (3.8%) or increase (4.6%) of inhibitor titer. Local bacterial infections and wound dehiscence complicated the evolution in 4.6% and 0.8 % of cases, respectively; we noticed no blood-borne infections or thrombotic accidents. Low dosage (10.7%) and short duration of substitution (21.4%) led to increased post-surgical bleeding and post-haemorrhagic anaemia. Surgery is a highly demanding intervention in haemophilia, which cannot be ignored in a low resource country. It represents a life or limb-saving and quality of life-improving measure. ","422":"Total knee arthroplasty (TKA) provides significant pain relief and better function in patients with end-stage haemophilic knee arthropathy. Peri- and postoperative care tends to be more complex than in non-haemophilic patients undergoing TKA and requires a multidisciplinary team approach. The implementation of standardized clinical pathways in non-haemophilic patients undergoing TKA has been shown to increase quality of care and to reduce postoperative complication rates. Consequently, the use of clinical pathways in haemophilic patients undergoing TKA may be beneficial to this particular subpopulation of patients. A clinical pathway for TKA for haemophilic patients was designed in a consensus process involving all participating departments. We propose a specifically adjusted clinical pathway for TKA for haemophilic patients to show that standardization of elective orthopaedic surgery in haemophilia is feasible. The authors emphasize that there are limitations on categorizing haemophilic patients and stress that individual interdisciplinary treatment should take precedence over a standardized approach. ","423":"After ankle and knee, the elbow is the most frequent joint affected by haemophilic arthropathy. The objective of this retrospective single centre study is to evaluate the results of treatment of elbow arthropathy after failed conservative therapy. In 21 consecutive patients, 11 radiosynoviortheses (RSO), four arthroscopic and six open synovectomies were performed, among them four with additional resection of the radial head. The mean duration of follow-up was 4.8 (RSO) and 5.3 years (surgery), respectively. Pain status (visual analogue scale, VAS), bleeding frequency, range of motion (ROM) as well as patient satisfaction were evaluated. Both, RSO and surgical synovectomy, achieved a significant reduction of pain and bleeding frequency (p &lt; 0.05). Surgical synovectomies were associated with a marked yet not statistically significant increase of postoperative ROM. Radial head resection improved forearm rotation in all cases. No complications occurred. 20 out of 21 patients were satisfied or highly satisfied with the result of the treatment and would undergo the respective procedure again. Due to the effectiveness and safety RSO is considered to be the primary treatment option in haemophilic arthropathy of the elbow after failed conservative therapy. Arthroscopic synovectomy should be considered if RSO shows inadequate effect or in the presence of contraindications. Open synovectomy with resection of the radial head yields good results in the case of advanced arthropathy with radial head impingement. ","424":"Climbing has a low risk of injury and strengthens the entire musculature. Due to its benefits in physical and mental health as well as its high fun factor climbing is an established way of therapy. So far, the usefulness of climbing therapy has not been shown for people with haemophilia (PWH). A crucial requirement for physical activity in PWH is regular prophylaxis. As the patient's individual pharmacokinetic (PK) response varies significantly, PK-tailored prophylaxis may decrease bleeding frequency. We describe a man (age 25 years) with severe haemophilia A who took part in an 8.5-month weekly climbing program under PK-tailored prophylaxis. Bleeding frequency, factor consumption, joint health (Haemophilia Joint Health Score, HJHS), quality of life (Haemo-QoL-A) and climbing performance (UIAA scale) were assessed before and after the training. Prior to the study, the patient was on demand treatment. The patient was started on standard prophylaxis for a 2 months period and then observed for 6.5 months under PK-tailored prophylaxis. PK-tailored prophylaxis was targeted to a trough level of 1-3%. For high-impact activities a factor activity &gt;15%, for low-impact activities a factor activity &gt;5% was suggested. Climbing therapy was safe. The bleeding rate decreased from 14 (2012) to 1 (during the study period of 8.5 months). The one bleeding event was due to a missed infusion and was not triggered by physical activity. The elimination half-life using Bayesian statistics was determined to be 16h. Using this half-life for PK-tailored prophylaxis reduced the factor VIII consumption in comparison to standard prophylaxis. Joint health was particularly improved in the categories range of motion and swelling. Quality of life scores stayed at a high level. Climbing performance improved by 1 grade. The combination of PK-tailored prophylaxis with therapeutic climbing improved clinical outcome in this young adult with severe haemophilia. The tailored concept for high- and low-impact activities appeared to be safe.

Therapeutic interventions should therefore be directed towards inhibiting growth of atherosclerotic lesions as well as towards prevention of lesion destabilization. Interestingly, the presence of mast cells has been demonstrated in both murine and human plaques, and multiple interventional murine studies have pointed out a direct role for mast cells in early and late stages of atherosclerosis. Moreover, it has recently been described that activated lesional mast cells correlate with major cardiovascular events in patients suffering from cardiovascular disease. This review focuses on the effect of different mast cell derived mediators in atherogenesis and in late stage plaque destabilization. Also, possible ligands for mast cell activation in the context of atherosclerosis are discussed. Finally, we will elaborate on the predictive value of mast cells, together with therapeutic implications, in cardiovascular disease.","426":"Shortly after myocardial infarction, various circulating leukocyte subsets accumulate in the heart. Leukocyte recruitment is highly coordinated and relies on cell production in the bone marrow, mobilization to the blood, and chemokine-mediated infiltration to the destination tissue. Neutrophils, which are phagocytic and inflammatory, are among the first leukocytes to accumulate in large numbers. Within a day, neutrophils disappear and are replaced by a subset of monocytes that further contribute to inflammation and phagocytosis. After a few days, monocyte-derived reparative macrophages accrue, quell inflammation, and foster angiogenesis and tissue remodelling. Studies suggest a well-balanced response comprising these three waves is essential to optimal infarct healing. ","427":"The outcome and clinical features during long term follow-up of 10 haemophilia patients (haemophilia A n = 9, haemophilia B n = 1), who underwent successful orthotopic liver transplantation (OLT) due to hepatitis associated liver disease, are summarised. Eight patients were HIV\/HCV co-infected. Despite severe postoperative complications, which were not bleeding-associated, all patients survived OLT. Long-term survival was 70% after in mean 8 years follow-up. Twelve years after OLT one patient developed a cyclosporine-induced nephropathy requiring haemodialysis. HIV-HAART was initiated in all patients after OLT, and allowed a successful HCV treatment in 6 patients. Factor VIII production was sufficient in mean 72 h after OLT and remained stable at subnormal to normal FVIII levels of in median 30% (range 14-96%) also during long-term follow-up. Post-OLT spontaneous bleeding events were rare compared to pre-OLT, therefore, the performance status improved in all patients. OLT substitutes the hepatic FVIII but has no effect on the extra-hepatic endothelial FVIII production, suggesting that in case of severe tissue injury enhanced bleeding might occur. Additionally, after OLT there is no acute phase reaction of the FVIII protein. Therefore, our OLT patients received in case of a reduced FVIII activity a peri-interventional prophylactic short-term FVIII substitution in surgical and diagnostic interventions with high bleeding risk. Bleeding and wound healing disturbances were not seen. ","428":"Prophylaxis in adults can be necessary and reasonable for clinical reasons. The aim was to evaluate from an economic viewpoint prophylactic factor VIII substitution in adult patients with haemophilia in Germany.

A prompt diagnosis of HPS patients could improve their quality of life and clinical management. However, the absence of a specific platelet function test, the wide molecular heterogeneity, and the lack of phenotype-genotype correlations hamper the rapid diagnosis. Nine subtypes of HPS have been identified as a result of mutations in nine genes that codify for proteins involved in formation and shuttle of the LRO. The molecular characterization of patients and knowledge derived from animal models of HPS contribute to the understanding of biogenesis and function of the LRO.

The ADAMTS13 dependent degradation of VWF to its proteolytic fragments can be visualized as a characteristic so-called triplet structure of individual VWF oligomers by multimer analysis. Lack of VWF high molecular weight multimers (VWF-HMWM) or their pathologically enhanced degradation underlies a particular type of von Willebrand disease, VWD type 2A with a significant bleeding tendency, and may also be observed in acquired von Willebrand syndrome due to cardiovascular disease. In these conditions multimer analysis is an obligatory and powerful tool for diagnosis of VWD. The opposite condition, the persistence of ultralarge VWF (UL-VWF) multimers may cause the microangiopathic life-threatening disorder thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). During the course of active TTP, UL-VWF is consumed in the hyaline thrombi formed in the microvasculature which will ultimately result in the loss of UL-VWF and VWF-HMWM. Therefore, VWF multimer analysis is not a valid tool to diagnose TTP in the active phase of disease but may be helpful for the diagnosis of TTP patients in remission.

Dual antiplatelet therapy composed of aspirin plus a third generation P2Y12 inhibitor (prasugrel or ticagrelor) represents the gold standard, while aspirin plus second generation P2Y12 inhibitor (clopidogrel) may be used as an alternative in the presence of contraindications for third generation P2Y12 inhibitors and\/or a high risk of bleeding. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) has been the unchallenged mainstay in anticoagulation for ACS for many decades and is still widely used in patients with ACS treated interventionally. Novel alternative parenteral anticoagulant strategies include the low molecular weight heparin enoxaparin and the synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux. Both of these agents share advantages over UFH particularly in medically treated patients with ACS not scheduled for PCI. The direct parenteral factor IIa (thrombin) inhibitor bivalirudin, when used as sole anticoagulant in patients with ACS undergoing PCI, is as effective as the regimen of UFH plus GPIIb\/IIIa inhibitor in NSTEMI and superior to the latter regimen in patients with STEMI. The novel approach of a long-term low dose factor Xa inhibition with rivaroxaban in the post ACS phase even further reduced cardiovascular mortality in a clinical trial but has yet to be established in daily clinical practice in the setting of third generation P2Y12 inhibitors.

In these patients, analysis reveals no causal mutations even after sequencing the whole coding region of F8 including the flanking splice sites, as well as the promoter and the 3' untranslated region (UTR). After excluding the mutations mimicking the haemophilia A phenotype in interacting partners of the FVIII protein affecting the half life and transport of the protein, mutations or rearrangements in non-coding regions of F8 have to be considered responsible for the haemophilia A phenotype.

Treatment strategy has changed over the last years by frequent use of more active agents inhibiting the ADP mediated activation of platelets instead of clopidogrel, such as prasugrel and ticagrelor. Compared to clopidogrel these modern antiplatelet drugs showed a significant reduction of efficacy endpoints as well as an acceptable safety profile in large multicenter randomized trials (TRITON TIMI 38, PLATO). Going in with higher efficacy a generally higher bleeding risk of prasugrel could be reduced by optimizing the maintenance dose in elderly and underweight patients (TRILOGY-ACS). However even prasugrel and ticagrelor have shown a delayed onset of action in special patient populations (e.g. STEMI) suggesting that the optimal ADP inhibitor has not been found yet. Results of the CHAMPION PHOENIX trial indicate that cangrelor, an intravenous agent, might fulfill these high expectations of an ideal platelet inhibitor in the first hours of an ACS in special patient cohorts.

Adipocytes secrete numerous hormones and cytokines (adipokines) which influence gene expression and cell functions in endothelial cells, arterial smooth muscle cells, and monocytes\/macrophages favouring the development of an atherosclerotic vulnerable plaque. Moreover, the release of such biologically active molecules also promotes endothelial function impairment, disturbs the haemostatic and fibrinolytic systems, and produces alterations in platelet function affecting the initiation, progression, and stabilization of thrombus formation upon atherosclerotic plaque rupture. In this review we will discuss the pathophysiological mechanisms by which obesity contributes to increase atherothrombosis paying special attention to its effects over thrombosis. ","458":"Methylation, CpG island, promoter, intron 1 Haemophilia A is the most common X-linked inherited coagulation disorder caused by a deficiency of the factor VIII protein (FVIII). A plethora of different mutations in the factor VIII gene (F8) have been identified as causative for this bleeding disease including a few promoter mutations. However, in approximately 2-5% of all haemophilic patients, the causal mutation still remains unknown. To our knowledge, epigenetic abnormalities in regulatory regions of the F8 gene have not yet been implicated in the disease pathogenesis. We therefore developed bisulfite pyrosequencing assays to screen patients with unknown mutation status for their methylation patterns in presumed regulative regions of the F8 gene (5'UTR and intron 1). The methylation patterns of haemophilia A patients did not differ from that of controls. In three patients, chromosomal aberrations were identified which could be associated with a defective FVIII synthesis. ","459":"The development of inhibitory anti-FVIII antibodies is currently the most severe complication in the treatment of haemophilia A patients. Inhibitor eradication can be achieved by immune tolerance induction (ITI). Recent findings suggest a correlation between the FVIII-specific IgG subclass distribution and the duration or outcome of ITI. To quantify FVIII-specific IgG subclasses in patients' plasma FVIII-specific IgG standards are required. Here, the isolation of FVIII-specific single chain variable fragments (scFvs) from synthetic phage display libraries and the characterisation of their FVIII domain specificity are described. The isolated scFv 1G10, which binds to the FVIII A2 domain, was cloned into the context of the four human IgG (hIgG) subclasses and expressed in mammalian cells. Purified 1G10-hIgG1, -hIgG2, -hIgG3 and -hIgG4 are used as standards to determine the absolute amounts and relative contribution of the different FVIII-specific IgG subclasses in future studies. The results from these studies will eventually add to understanding the role of the FVIII-specific IgG subclass distribution as prognostic factor for the outcome of ITI. ","460":"Since 1982, the multicenter study of the epidemiology of patients with haemophilia is carried out annually with the support of all sizes of haemophilia centers and treatment facilities. The long period of investigation has not only enabled the reporting of up-to-date mortality and morbidity status, but also of retrospective observations. The participating centers have made anonymized data available for patients with Haemophilia A, B and von Willebrand's disease (total counts for treated patients, type and severity of the disease, HIV status and causes of death). For 2011-2012 3331 patients were reported with haemophilia A or B from 32 centers. Although the mortality from HIV\/AIDS in haemophilia patients continues to decline, HIV infection remains clinically relevant since an HIV\/HCV coinfection can raise the risk of severe liver disease. The data from the multicenter survey were, together with the anonymized data from the Foundation for Humanitarian Aid for Persons Infected with HIV though Blood Products, comparatively descriptively compared and the temporal progression illustrated by a so-called moving average. Expectedly, haemophilia patients were shown to be under-represented by the data from the multicenter survey. Otherwise, the data are consistent. ","461":"Patients with haemophilia are growing older and may be faced with age-dependent co-morbidities. To evaluate the impact of growing age in patients with haemophilia, a questionaire was sent to members of German patients' organisations DHG and IGH with focus on medical care and psychosocial questions. This questionnaire was answered by 466 individuals (aged 50 years, 21-85 years), predominantly suffering from severe haemophilia. The majority of individuals considered the question of substitution of factor concentrates in case of bleeding as most important. Concerns were expressed regarding the financial situation and lack of medical care in higher age. The results provide an insight into issues of growing age from the patient's perspective.

Baxter is continuously pursuing the aim to provide new therapeutic options to patients with haemophilia and to their treating physicians. In fact, there are several opportunities to improve existing therapies, e.g., by new indications for existing products, the introduction of new products, and by novel therapeutic approaches other than factor replacement. Among these, Baxter is working on a number of innovations, such as pharmacokinetics-tailored factor VIII prophylaxis, bypassing agent prophylaxis with FEIBA in inhibitor patients, development of a longer acting pegylated recombinant FVIII, a new recombinant factor IX, a new recombinant factor FVIIa, the first recombinant von Willebrand factor, recombinant ADAMTS13 (a disintegrin and metalloproteinase with a thrombospondin type 1 motif, member 13) as well as gene therapy to cure haemophilia B.

Registered are patients with haemophilia A and B, von Willebrand disease with VWF:R-Co &lt; 10% and other rare factor deficiencies. For this latter group, inclusion in the Registry depends on the clinical relevance of the bleeding disorder, not on the factor level. Data come directly from the Swiss haemophilia reference and treatment centers and should be updated once a year. Currently 967 patients are registered, the majority (587) presenting with haemophilia A. Disease severity is graded according to ISTH criteria. Basic epidemiological findings are similar to those from larger registries in Europe, Canada or the USA. More that 60% of persons with haemophilia in Switzerland are treated on-demand, with the exception of young patients (&lt;20 years) who present an 80 to 90% rate of prophylactic therapy. Nevertheless, global use of factor concentrates went continuously up over the last decade and reaches now 5.52 Units per capita, still a low value compared to other high-income European countries.

Specific data of the significance of this problem and its changes in recent years in Germany are not available. Thus, we analyzed the incidence of VTE in hospitalized young patients and looked for gender-specific differences. Detailed lists of all pulmonary embolisms (PE) coded as I26 and deep vein thrombosis (DVT) coded as I80 in patients aged 10 to 39 years hospitalized in the years 2005 to 2011 were provided by the Federal Statistical Office. Beginning at the age of 12-13 years girls have higher numbers of PE and DVT documented as principal diagnosis, as compared to boys. This gender-specific difference disappears at the ages of 32-33 years. The difference in total numbers of PE (as principal diagnosis) between women and men within this 20-year time span increased from 318 in 2005 to 606 in 2010 and decreased to 505 in 2011. Stratifying the cases of PE according to presence or absence of cor pulmonale, the analysis showed a specific increase of PE in young women without cor pulmonale within the period of seven years between 2005 and 2011. Similar changes could not be shown for DVT as principal diagnosis. The presented data from the German DRG statistics show a disproportionally higher increase of young women hospitalised for pulmonary embolism as principal diagnosis in recent years. The possible impact of hormonal contraception on this increase has to be further elucidated. ","469":"Fibrinogen plays an essential role in clot formation and stability. Importantly it seems to be the most vulnerable coagulation factor, reaching critical levels earlier than the others during the course of severe injury. A variety of causes of fibrinogen depletion in major trauma have been identified, such as blood loss, dilution, consumption, hyperfibrinolysis, hypothermia and acidosis. Low concentrations of fibrinogen are associated with an increased risk of diffuse microvascular bleeding. Therefore, repeated measurements of plasma fibrinogen concentration are strongly recommended in trauma patients with major bleeding. Recent guidelines recommend maintaining plasma fibrinogen concentration at 1.5-2 g\/l in coagulopathic patients. It has been shown that early fibrinogen substitution is associated with improved outcome. ","470":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) occurs as the result of numerous complex physiological processes in the atria leading to AF promotion and maintenance. Improved diagnostic techniques have identified various biomarkers which may play an important role in the prediction of AF related outcomes (cardio- and cerebrovascular events, as well as mortality and rhythm outcomes). Biomarkers refer to 'biological markers' and biomarkers in blood, urine as well as imaging marker (eg, dimensions (left atrial diameter and volume), anatomical features (left appendage and pulmonary vein anatomy), and physiological pattern (LAA flow velocity)) may play important role(s) as clinically important indices in relation to outcomes after different therapeutic strategies. However, the main domain in the biomarker field has focused on blood-based biomarkers, which are widely used to predict therapeutic success regarding underlying pathophysiological mechanism, such as inflammation, fibrosis, endothelial damage. This review provides an update of the role of clinically relevant biomarkers in AF, with particular focus on AF rhythm outcomes. ","471":"The direct factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban is approved for venous thromboembolism (VTE) treatment in adults. However, in all phase-III trials children or adolescents have not been included. For under-aged VTE patients, current standard treatment consists of low molecular weight heparin or Vitamin K antagonists. Rivaroxaban could be an attractive alternative, however, no data on the pharmacokinetics (PK) of rivaroxaban in adolescents are currently available. PATIENT, METHODS: We report PK data for rivaroxaban derived from a girl (age:15 years), who presented three month after acute deep vein thrombosis, already receiving rivaroxaban therapy. In the steady state of rivaroxaban therapy (20 mg once daily), plasma levels at baseline, 3 and 6 hours after intake of rivaroxaban were measured to evaluate the pharmacokinetics and changes of global coagulation tests. At baseline, a very low trough level of only 9.9 ng\/ml rivaroxaban was found. At 3 hours, a peak concentration of 137.76 ng\/ml rivaroxaban was observed with a rapid decrease within 6 hours after drug intake, when plasma levels of 34.45 ng\/ml were measured. The patients INR and aPTT values reacted correspondingly. Our data indicate that adolescents may exhibit lower peak and trough levels after rivaroxaban intake compared to adult patients, but seem to have similar PK curves during the elimination phase. While our case is the first published case of a successful VTE treatment in an under-aged patient, we strongly discourage the routine use of rivaroxaban in non-adult patients, until data from phase II and III trials are available. ","472":"Primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PPCI) is the preferred reperfusion therapy in ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI), as long as it can be delivered within 90-120 minutes from patient's first medical contact, and is the leading reperfusion strategy in most European countries. However, as PPCI cannot be offered in a timely manner to all patients, fibrinolytic therapy (FT) is the recommended choice in patients with an anticipated delay to PPCI of &gt;90-120 minutes, presenting early after symptom onset and without contra-indications. FT should preferably be started in the pre-hospital setting. Following FT, all patients should be transferred to a PCI-center for rescue PCI or routine coronary angiography with PCI as indicated. Such a pharmaco-invasive strategy, combining FT with invasive treatment, has recently been shown to be non-inferior to PPCI in patients living in areas with long transfer delays to PCI (&gt;60 minutes). In this overview, we will briefly present the evidence for the benefit of FT in STEMI, and discuss the role of FT in the current era of PPCI as well as the optimal treatment following pharmacologic reperfusion. ","473":"In patients pretreated with P2Y12 receptor inhibitors who need to undergo non-emergent cardiac or major non-cardiac surgery, current guidelines of the European Society of Cardiology recommend postponing surgery for at least five days after last intake of clopidogrel or ticagrelor, and for seven days after last intake of prasugrel, unless there is high risk of ischemic events. However, a fixed five to seven days preoperative waiting period may be challenged, in the presence of inter-individual variability in on-treatment platelet reactivity. Therefore, Society of Thoracic Surgeons guidelines suggest to base decisions about a surgical delay on platelet function although both, the optimal platelet function assay and a bleeding cutoff have not yet been defined by large scale multicenter trials. This review aims to provide an overview on current knowledge of P2Y12 receptor induced platelet inhibition and surgery related bleeding and the potential role of platelet function analysis to time surgery. ","474":"Cardiovascular diseases remain to be the leading cause of death in Western societies. Despite major findings in vascular biology that lead to a better understanding of the pathomechanisms involved in atherosclerosis, treatment of the disease has only changed slightly within the last years. A big body of evidence suggests that atherosclerosis is a chronic inflammatory disease of the vessel wall. Accumulation and peroxidation of LDL-particles within the vessel wall trigger a strong inflammatory response, causing macrophage and T-cell accumulation within the vessel wall. Additionally, B-cells and specific antibodies against LDL-particles, as well as the complement system are implicated in atherogenesis. Besides data from clinical trials and autopsy studies it was the implementation of mouse models of atherosclerosis and the emerging field of direct gen-modification that lead to a thorough description of the pathophysiological mechanisms involved in the disease and created overwhelming evidence for a participation of the immune system. Recently, the cross-talk between coagulation and inflammation in atherogenesis has gained attention. Serious limitations and disparities in the pathophysiology of atherosclerosis in mice and men complicated the translation of experimental data into clinical practice. Despite these limitations, new anti-inflammatory medical therapies in cardiovascular disease are currently being tested in clinical trials. ","475":"Extensive research of the past decades altered our traditional concept about the genesis of atherosclerosis fundamentally. Today, the crucial role of inflammation in the formation and progression of atherosclerotic plaques is indisputable. Patients at high risk for developing cardiovascular disease, owing to poor diet, obesity and low physical activity have been shown to exhibit a particular inflammatory pattern. Therefore, the present review highlights the crosslink between the metabolic syndrome (MetS), adipose tissue, adipokines and selected inflammatory cytokines in the context of atherothrombosis and cardiovascular disease.

In a patient with recurrence long term prognosis and treatment are significantly altered both carrying their own risks not only in the acute phase but mainly in the long term perspective. Thus, accurate diagnosis of recurrence is of utmost importance for the fate of the patient. Diagnosis of a first DVT episode is well established and follows an algorithm including clinical prediction rules, D-Dimer testing and compression ultrasound. Due to the previous episode the efficiency of all three elements is impaired in a patient with suspected recurrence. This opens up areas of uncertainty which have to be filled by individual clinical judgement. Guidelines reflect this difficulty by providing mainly weak recommendations based on sparse data. The present review summarizes what is known about the performance of tools for DVT diagnosis, discusses recent guidelines, and finally gives personally weighed recommendations how to deal with this peculiar diagnostic situation. In conclusion, it will turn out that the well accepted diagnostic algorithm for a first DVT may be applied as well if the lower efficiency is regarded. Compression ultrasound largely benefits from a baseline assessment at the end of the previous episode. The order of tests may be discussed according to local and regional attitudes. ","479":"Superficial vein thrombosis (SVT) is a common disease, characterized by an inflammatory-thrombotic process in a superficial vein. Typical clinical findings are pain and a warm, tender, reddish cord along the vein. Until recently, no reliable epidemiological data were available. The incidence is estimated to be higher than that of deep-vein thrombosis (DVT) (1\/1000). SVT shares many risk factors with DVT, but affects twice as many women than men and frequently occurs in varicose veins. Clinically, SVT extension is commonly underestimated, and patients may have asymptomatic DVT. Therefore, ultrasound assessment and exclusion of DVT is essential. Risk factors for concomitant DVT are recent hospitalization, immobilization, autoimmune disorders, age &gt; 75 years, prior VTE, cancer and SVT in non-varicose veins. Even though most patients with isolated SVT (without concomitant DVT or PE) are commonly treated with anticoagulation for a median of 15 days, about 8% experience symptomatic thromboembolic complications within three months. Risk factors for occurrence of complications are male gender, history of VTE, cancer, SVT in a non-varicose vein or SVT involving the sapheno-femoral junction (SFJ). As evidence supporting treatment of isolated SVT was sparse and of poor quality, the large, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled CALISTO trial was initiated assessing the effect of fondaparinux on symptomatic outcomes in isolated SVT. This study showed that, compared with placebo, 2.5 mg fondaparinux given for 45 days reduced the risk of symptomatic thromboembolic complications by 85% without increasing bleeding. Based on CALISTO and other observational studies, evidence-based recommendations can be made for the majority of SVT patients. Further studies can now be performed in higher risk patients to address unresolved issues. ","480":"The term unusual site venous thrombosis defines uncommon clinical manifestations of venous thromboembolism occurring in sites different from the lower limbs or the lungs, with peculiar pathophysiological features and clinical history. Information on long-term outcomes of unusual site thrombosis is generally scant, because most studies are small and usually retrospective. Recurrence rate of cerebral vein thrombosis is about 2\/100 patient-years; the only identified predisposing factors have been male gender and personal history of thrombosis. Retinal vein occlusion showed a recurrence in the same eye of 2.5% and in the fellow eye of 11.9% within four years. Hypercholesterolemia, hypertriglyceridaemia and hyperhomocysteinaemia were significantly associated with recurrent events. Recurrence rates of splanchnic vein thrombosis are difficult to estimate given the heterogeneity of patient populations; higher recurrence rates are reported in the cirrhotic population (from 27% to 38.5%). Hormone therapy, myeloproliferative neoplasm or other prothrombotic states, and absence of anticoagulant therapy emerged as independent prognostic factors. Future studies should aim at better assessing the risk of recurrence in different patients subgroups and at identifying more accurate prognostic markers. ","481":"Deciding on the optimal duration of anticoagulation is based on the risk of recurrent venous thromboembolism (VTE) and of bleeding during anticoagulation. The duration of anticoagulation should be at least three months since shorter courses double the recurrence rates. At three months anticoagulation can be stopped in patients with a VTE provoked by a transient risk factor, as the recurrence risk is expected to be lower than the bleeding risk during anticoagulation. Patients with unprovoked VTE are at higher risk of recurrence and prolonged anticoagulation is currently recommended. However, attempts are made to stratify these patients according to their recurrence risk and to identify those with a low recurrence risk who would not benefit from extended anticoagulation. Novel approaches to optimize the management of patients with unprovoked VTE are the use of prediction models which link clinical patient characteristics with laboratory testing to discriminate between patients with a low risk (who may discontinue anticoagulation) and those with high risk (in whom long term anticoagulation is justified). Moreover, new antithrombotic concepts including new oral anticoagulants or aspirin both of which potentially confer a lower bleeding risk and are more convenient for the patients have been explored for extended thromboprophylaxis. ","482":"Some cases of thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) are refractory to plasma exchange therapy (PE) with persistence or recurrence of thrombocytopenia. We report two patients suffering from TMA of different aetiologies (associated with disseminated malignancy, typical haemolytic uraemic syndrome) with recurrent or persistent thrombocytopenia despite adequate therapy including PE. Since both patients were exposed to unfractionated heparin, heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) was suspected as a cause. Pretest probabilities for HIT were intermediate. ELISA for PF4\/heparin antibodies was strongly positive in both cases, and HIT was confirmed by heparin-induced platelet activation assay. Anticoagulation with lepirudin was initiated, with subsequent rapid increase of the platelet count. TMA might represent a predisposition for HIT. This could be due to TMA-related platelet activation with increased PF4 release. In TMA patients exposed to heparin and with refractory or rapidly recurrent thrombocytopenia HIT should always be considered as a possible cause.","483":"The thrombotic microangiopathies (TMA) are a heterogeneous group of disorders, characterized by microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia with red cell fragmentation, thrombocytopenia and signs of organ dysfunction due to disturbed microcirculation. Current laboratory methods can be used to better distinguish some of these entities. Organ dysfunction can be severe and life-threatening, and immediate start of sufficient therapy is necessary to avoid permanent damage or death. The therapeutic options, however, are often limited to symptomatic measures, and are not standardized or based on high scientific evidence. During the preceding years, not only considerable progress has been made in better diagnosis of TMA, but also new therapeutic strategies have been established. Initial treatment still is based on plasma exchange and symptomatic measures to protect organ function. New concepts (immunosuppression, targeted anti-von Willebrand factor or anti-complement therapy, replacement with recombinant enzymes) are discussed in this article.","484":"The Upshaw Schulman syndrome (MIM #274150) is a hereditary deficiency of the von Willebrand factor cleaving protease (ADAMTS13) due to homozygous or compound heterozygous mutations in the ADAMTS13 gene. Patients are prone to bouts of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura. However, disease manifestation needs a second trigger event. Pregnancy is a known risk factor for TTP. Patients with USS may manifest during pregnancy and the postpartum period or relapse with a TTP bout. Before plasma therapy mortality for both the mother and the fetus was high, but even nowadays when plasma is delivered, therapy is challenging, still bearing a high risk for miscarriage or long term sequelae for the mother. In this report on pregnancies in three mothers with USS, plasma therapy was increased in frequency and amount given with regard to platelet count or ADAMTS13 activity, thus leading to a successful outcome.","485":"Hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, Upshaw-Schulman syndrome, ADAMTS13 Hereditary thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), also known as Upshaw-Schulman syndrome, is a rare recessively inherited disease.

The clinical picture is variable and more and more patients with an adult-onset are diagnosed. In the majority of countries the only available treatment is plasma, which when administered regularly can efficiently prevent acute disease bouts. The decision to initiate regular prophylaxis is often not easy, as evidence based guidelines and long term outcome data are lacking. Through the hereditary TTP registry (www.ttpregistry.net, ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT01257269), which was initiated in 2006 and is open to all patients diagnosed with Upshaw-Schulman syndrome and their family members, we aim to gain further information and insights into this rare disease, which eventually will help to improve clinical management of affected patients.","486":"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP), a life threatening disease, can be induced by congenital or acquired deficiency of plasma metalloprotease ADAMTS13. Since the publication of the first genetic analysis in patients with congenital ADAMTS13 deficiency in 2001, more than 100 genetic defects in the ADAMTS13 gene have been reported worldwide. Genetic analysis in patients with ADAMTS13 deficiency has greatly contributed to the understanding of the etiology of TTP. A rapid and quantitative assay method for the plasma ADAMTS13 activity was developed recently in 2005 and opened a new area of TTP research - namely genetic research using a general population to evaluate age and gender differences of ADAMTS13 activity as well as phenotype - genotype correlations of genetic polymorphisms and estimation of a homozygote or a compound heterozygote ADAMTS13 deficiencies. The Japanese general population study included 3616 individuals with an age between 30 - 80 years confirming other studies that while ADAMTS13 activity decreased with age, VWF antigen increased and VWF antigen levels are lowest in blood group O indviduals, whereas ADAMTS13 activity levels were not associated with the AB0 blood group. 25 polymorphisms with a minor allele frequency of more than 0.01 were found, among them 6 missense mutations and 19 synonymous mutations, except P475S missense polymorphisms that was only idenitified in an East Asian population, characterized by reduced ADAMTS13 activity. Prevalence of congenital ADAMTS13 deficiency in the Japanese population was estimated about one individual in 1.1 x 106 to be homozygote or compound heterozygote for ADAMTS13 deficiency. So far more than 40 mutations in Japanese congenital TTP patients were found, but R193W, Q449*, C754Afs*24 (c.2259delA) and C908Y were identified in more than four patients suggesting the precipitaion of these mutations in the Japanese population.","487":"","488":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a disease, which often recurs. The recurrence risk is highest in patients with unprovoked proximal deep-vein thrombosis (VT) or pulmonary embolism. Men have a higher risk than women. The risk is low in patients with VTE related to a temporary risk factor such as surgery or estrogen use. Other risk factors include overweight, post-thrombotic syndrome, history of VTE, residual VT or a vena cava filter. Both factor V Leiden and the prothrombin mutation confer a negligible increase in recurrence risk. High clotting factor levels, deficiency of a natural coagulation inhibitor, or hyperhomocysteinaemia are also associated with an increased risk. Reasons why routine laboratory thrombophilia screening however is no longer warranted are addressed in this article. Prediction rules combining clinical characteristics and coagulation assays have recently been developed. One such model, the Vienna Prediction Model, allows predicting recurrent VTE on the basis of VTE location, sex and D-dimer. This article describes strategies to distinguish between patients with high risk of recurrent VTE from those with a lower risk, who might not benefit from long-term antithrombotic therapy. ","489":"The focus of DVT treatment is the prevention of recurrence and thrombus migration by treatment with anticoagulants. The aim is to improve outcomes by reducing clot burden and by preventing thrombus propagation, in order to prevent PE and the development of long-term complication. Actually, initial therapy is parenteral anticoagulation, mainly with low molecular weight heparin followed by a vitamin K antagonist (VKA) for triggered and idiopathic DVT. The long term treatment suggestion with a VKA is for sure the most challenging therapeutic scenario, showing all the disadvantages of VKA especially in the onset phase when therapeutic levels of VKA are difficult to achieve. The difference between VKAs and NOACs is the fact, that NOACs target a specific factor in the coagulation cascade. At time now two pathways have been chosen for treatment options, the direct inhibition of active sites of thrombin and factor Xa. Routine monitoring is not required and the drugs can be administered in fixed doses, which should increase patient adherence to long term treatment. At time now, four novel anticoagulants are called to be options for DVT treatment. Rivaroxaban, apixaban and edoxaban are direct FXa inhibitors, whereas dabigtran etexilate is a direct thrombin inhibitor.

The spectrum of possible aetiologies is wide, ranging from an in vitro artefact to severe treatment-resistant thrombocytopenic bleeding conditions, or even life-threatening prothrombotic states. Moreover, thrombocytopenia by itself does not protect from thrombosis and sometimes a patient with a low platelet count requires concomitant antithrombotic treatment as well. In order to identify and treat the cause and the effects of the thrombocytopenia, you have to put together several pieces of information, solving a unique jig-jaw puzzle.

Automation has been introduced and perfected by clinical chemistry and since then expanded into other fields such as haematology, immunology, molecular biology and also coagulation testing. The initial small and relatively simple standalone instruments have been replaced by more complex systems that allow for multitasking. Integration of automated coagulation testing into total laboratory automation has become possible in the most recent years. Automation has many strengths and opportunities if weaknesses and threats are respected. On the positive side, standardization, reduction of errors, reduction of cost and increase of throughput are clearly beneficial. Dependence on manufacturers, high initiation cost and somewhat expensive maintenance are less favourable factors. The modern lab and especially the todays lab technicians and academic personnel in the laboratory do not add value for the doctor and his patients by spending lots of time behind the machines.

Recent insights have shown that this is not due to less formation of atherosclerosis than in non-haemophilic men, therefore protection from the final occlusive thrombus will be the major determinant. Prevalence and incidence rates of cardiovascular disease (especially non-fatal events) are scarce, although ongoing studies are addressing this issue. Meanwhile, because the haemophilia population is aging, we are increasingly confronted with cardiovascular events. The main cardiovascular risk factors that should be part of regular screening programs are hypertension, overweight, lipometabolic disorders and smoking. Anticoagulation therapy in haemophilia is feasible, provided that individual tailored coagulation therapy and close monitoring is provided.

Autoantibodies to ADAMTS13 either neutralize its activity or accelerate its clearance, thereby causing a severe deficiency of ADAMTS13 in plasma. As a consequence, size regulation of VWF is impaired and the persistence of ultra-large VWF (ULVWF) multimers facilitates microvascular platelet aggregation causing microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia and ischaemic organ damage. Autoimmune TTP although a rare disease with an annual incidence of 1.72 cases has a mortality rate of 20% even with adequate therapy. We describe the mechanisms involved in ADAMTS13 autoimmunity with a focus on the role of B- and T-cells in the pathogenesis of this disorder.

Secondary prophylaxis in children has also been shown to have a more beneficial effect on joint protection as on-demand treatment. The outcome of delayed secondary prophylaxis started in adulthood is rarely studied. The case of a man (age: 47 years) with severe haemophilia A demonstrates the successful switch from on-demand therapy to prophylaxis with subsequent reduction of annual bleeding rate and number of days of work lost. The small increase of factor VIII consumption (16%) and the decrease of bleeding rate are compared with data from two recently published prospective studies. An optimal dosing schedule needs to be discussed and larger and longer prospective studies targeting the benefits of secondary prophylaxis with factor VIII started in adulthood are necessary. ","496":"The endothelium lining the vascular lumen is continuously exposed to complement from the circulation. When erroneously activated on host cells, complement may generate a deleterious effect on the vascular wall leading to endothelial injury, exposure of the subendothelial matrix and platelet activation. In this review the contribution of complement activation to formation and maintenance of the pathological lesion termed thrombotic microangiopathy (TMA) is discussed. TMA is defined by vessel wall thickening affecting mainly arterioles and capillaries, detachment of the endothelial cell from the basement membrane and intraluminal thrombosis resulting in occlusion of the vessel lumen. The TMA lesion occurs in haemolytic uraemic syndrome (HUS) and thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP). HUS is further sub-classified as associated with Shiga toxin-producing Escherichia coli (STEC-HUS) or with complement dysregulation (atypical HUS) as well as other less common forms. The contribution of dysregulated complement activation to endothelial injury and platelet aggregation is reviewed as well as specific complement involvement in the development of HUS and TTP.","497":"Placental-mediated pregnancy complications (PmC) like preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction and placental abruption are common causes of fetal and maternal morbidity and mortality. The high prevalence of hereditary thrombophilias in case-control studies associated with pathological morphological findings of the placenta in these cases gave evidence for the association between hereditary thrombophilias and PmC. However, data from the literature are inconsistent, since subsequent prospective cohort studies could not demonstrate significant associations between inherited thrombophilia and PmC. Because of the multifactorial aetiology of PmC it may be difficult to prove, that hereditary thrombophilias are independent risk factors for PmC. Current guidelines do not recommend screening for inherited thrombophilias in patients with previous PmC. Evidence from current in vitro studies have shown, that heparin has beneficial non-anticoagulatory effects on trophoblast invasion. Retrospective case-control studies and recently published randomised controlled cohort studies have shown, that prophylactic administration of low-molecular-weight heparin (LWH), started in early pregnancy, may lead to a significant reduction in the incidence of PmC in subsequent pregnancies in patients with and without hereditary thrombophilias and previous PmC. Large, well-designed multicenter studies are needed to elucidate the role of hereditary thrombophilias in cases of PmC and to confirm the benefit of LWH for subsequent pregnancy outcomes. ","498":"MicroRNAs (miRNAs), highly conserved, short (approx. 22 nucleotides) non-coding RNAs, exhibit a fine-tune control over gene expression by complementary sequence binding and translational repression of protein coding mRNA transcripts. Recently, the role of miRNAs has been increasingly investigated in various physiological or pathophysiological events. Circulating platelets are crucial for coagulation physiology to maintain haemostatic balance and are involved in various pathologies such as atherosclerosis and thrombosis. Anucleate platelets lack genomic DNA but inherit diverse array of functional coding or non-coding RNAs and translational machinery from their parent cells - megakaryocytes enabling activated platelets to synthesize proteins which suggests the possibility of post transcriptional gene regulation in platelets. Expression of functionally active miRNAs in platelets changes during platelet activation indicating a role in platelet biology. Here, we present a review on recently identified platelet miRNAs and their role in platelet physiology that is essential for maintaining haemostasis.","499":"The Oklahoma Thrombotic Thrombocytopenic Purpura-Haemolytic Uraemic Syndrome (TTP-HUS) Registry has a 24 year record of success for collaborative clinical research, education, and patient care. This article tells the story of how the Registry began and it describes the Registry's structure and function. The Registry provides a model for using a cohort of consecutive patients to investigate a rare disorder. Collaboration between Oklahoma, United States and Bern, Switzerland has been the basis for successful interpretation of Registry data. Registry data have provided new insights into the evaluation and management of TTP. Because recovery from acute episodes of TTP has been assumed to be complete, the increased prevalence of hypertension, diabetes, depression, and death documented by long-term follow-up was unexpected. Registry data have provided opportunities for projects for students and trainees, education of physicians and nurses, and also for patients themselves. During our follow-up, patients have also educated Registry investigators about problems that persist after recovery from an acute episode of TTP. Most important, Registry data have resulted in important improvements for patient care.","500":"To compare the efficacy and safety of the new oral anticoagulants (NOAC), ideally head-to-head clinical trials should be performed. Given the expense of such an undertaking, it is highly unlikely that such a comparison would be performed. Therefore, there is a need for an unbiased comparative assessment of the benefits and risks of the NOACs, based on the available trial data. Indirect or mixed treatment comparisons may be an useful tool to overcome these limitations also known as network meta-analysis (NMA). The aim of this paper is to give an overview on published NMAs for dabigatran, rivaroxaban and apixaban, each assessed against warfarin in patients with atrial fibrillation, and against enoxaparin in patients undergoing total knee and total hip replacement surgery, in order to obtain insights into the comparability of the adopted methodological techniques.","501":"Management of acute pulmonary embolism (PE) has advanced considerably in the past year, and progress is expected to continue in 2013. To help determine the optimal management strategy for normotensive patients with intermediate-risk PE, the Pulmonary Embolism Thrombolysis (PEITHO) study completed enrolment of 1006 patients with evidence of right ventricular dysfunction (by echocardiography or computed tomography) plus a positive troponin test. Patients have been randomised to thrombolytic treatment with tenecteplase versus placebo, and the effects on clinical end points (death or haemodynamic collapse) assessed at 7 and 30 days. The results are expected in spring 2013; long-term follow-up is also being performed. The results of a randomised trial on ultrasound-enhanced low-dose catheter-delivered thrombolysis will also become available soon. While optimisation of treatment with vitamin K antagonists incorporating pharmacogenetic testing is still being pursued, new oral anticoagulants are entering the field of PE treatment and secondary prophylaxis. Following the successful use of rivaroxaban as single oral drug therapy in the EINSTEIN-PE trial, the approval of this drug has recently been extended to cover, apart from deep vein thrombosis, PE as well. The apixaban (AMPLIFY) and edoxaban (HOKUSAI) trials have finished recruitment of PE patients, and their results will become available shortly. In the meantime, the AMPLIFY-EXT trial showed that both the therapeutic (5 mg twice daily) and the prophylactic dose (2.5 mg twice daily) of apixaban are effective and safe for long-term secondary prophylaxis after PE. For the extended prophylaxis (after the reommended initial anticoagulation period) of the (few) patients who are unable to tolerate any form of anticoagulation, low-dose asprin may be a safe albeit moderately efficacious option, as indicated by two recent investigator-initiated trials with a total of 1224 patients.","502":"Upon vascular injury or tissue damage, the exposed intracellular material such as nucleic acids, histones and other macromolecules may come into contact with vessel wall cells and circulating blood cells and may thus, have an enduring influence on wound healing and body defence processes. This short review summarizes recent work related to extracellular DNA and RNA and their role as prominent alarm signals and inducers of different defence reactions related to innate immunity and thrombus formation. Of particular importance are DNA-histone complexes (nucleosome material) that, having been expelled during stimulation of the neutrophils, not only trap and eliminate bacteria but also promote thrombus formation in the arterial and venous system. Consequently therefore, the administration of DNase exhibits strong antithrombotic functions. Similarly, extracellular RNA provokes activation of the contact phase system of blood coagulation and, by interacting with specific proteins and cytokines, it promotes vascular permeability and oedema formation. The development of RNA-mediated thrombosis, vasogenic oedema or proinflammatory responses are counteracted by the administration of RNase1 in several pathogenetic animal models. Thus, extracellular nucleic acids appear not only to function as host alarm signals that serve to amplify the defence response, but they also provide important links to thrombus formation as part of the innate immune system.","503":"Blood platelets are highly activated in the setting of an acute coronary syndrome (ACS). This fact mandates the need for potent platelet inhibition in ACS patients and especially in patients undergoing a percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). The 2 nd  generation thienopyridine clopidogrel has been the standard of treatment in the past. Due to its pharmacological properties including a delayed onset of action, a large response variability and an insufficient antiplatelet action in some patients (low responsiveness or high on-treatment platelet reactivity), there was a need to develop, to study and to introduce more potent agents with a fast, reliable and potent antiplatelet action. With the 3rd  generation thienopyridine prasugrel and with ticagrelor two potent agents for antiplatelet treatment of ACS patients are available now. Both drugs have demonstrated their superiority compared to clopidogrel in terms of thrombotic risk reduction in large-scale randomized trials. However, for these agents and in line with the expectations towards a more potent antiplatelet treatment regimen, a higher risk for bleeding was observed for prasugrel and ticagrelor. Further on, the new antiplatelet agents have their own and characteristic contraindications and numerous issues to be considered in clinical practice.This review aims to provide an overview on the state of the art P2Y12 receptor directed inhibition in ACS patients with a focus on patients undergoing a coronary stenting procedure.","504":null,"505":"","506":null,"507":null,"508":"Rivaroxaban, the first direct factor-Xa inhibitor anticoagulant, has been approved for the prevention of venous thromboembolism in adult patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement surgery, for stroke prophylaxis in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation and for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis. There is no requirement for coagulation monitoring with rivaroxaban in routine clinical practice. However, in certain clinical circumstances such as life-threatening bleeding or an emergency operation the measurement of the thromboplastin time with a sensitive reagent will deliver first information. A quantitative determination of rivaroxaban plasma concentration is possible using an anti-factor Xa assay. In the case of a patient under long-term anticoagulation with rivaroxaban requiring an elective surgery, a discontinuation of rivaroxaban 20 to 30 hours before the operation is sufficient to normalize the associated bleeding risk, as long as the renal and liver function is normal. A longer interval should be taken into consideration, when the patient presents a renal and liver impairment or is of a higher age. In the event of an emergency operation effective rivaroxaban concentrations might be present. Nevertheless, we advise against using a prophylactic dose of factor concentrates. From a clinical perspective, in the event of a minor bleeding we recommend a temporary discontinuation of rivaroxaban, whereas for clinically relevant major or severe bleeding events a mechanical compression or a limited surgical i.e. interventional treatment is required. Supportive measures such as the administration of blood products or tranexamic acid might be beneficial. In addition to haemodynamic supportive measures life threatening bleeding events demand a comprehensive haemostasis management, as well as the application of PCC. ","509":"The chapter of inherited thrombocytopenias has expanded greatly over the last decade and many \"new\" forms deriving from mutations in \"new\" genes have been identified. Nevertheless, nearly half of patients remain without a definite diagnosis because their illnesses have not yet been described. The diagnostic approach to these diseases can still take advantage of the algorithm proposed by the Italian Platelet Study Group in 2003, although an update is required to include the recently described disorders. So far, transfusions of platelet concentrates have represented the main tool for preventing or treating bleedings, while haematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been reserved for patients with very severe forms. However, recent disclosure that an oral thrombopoietin mimetic is effective in increasing platelet count in patients with MYH9-related thrombocytopenia opened new therapeutic perspectives. This review summarizes the general aspects of inherited thrombocytopenias and describes in more detail MYH9-related diseases (encompassing four thrombocytopenias previously recognized as separate diseases) and the recently described ANKRD26-related thrombocytopenia, which are among the most frequent forms of inherited thrombocytopenia.","510":null,"511":null,"512":null,"513":"Cardiovascular diseases are the most common disorder in the developed countries. Invasive cardiological and cardiosurgical techniques are known therapies. Yet, patients with severe hereditary haemorrhagical diseases (haemophilia, rare deficiencies of coagulation factors) have an increased bleeding risk by the use of anticoagulants. Therefore, the treatment of these patients requires a concomitant therapy.  This article shows eight patients with a severe bleeding diathesis and cardiosurgical interventions in the years 2006 to 2011. This case report shall demonstrate that an adequate therapy can be accomplished with the help of a good cooperation between haemostaseologists and colleagues of the cardioinvasive\/cardiosurgical disciplines.","514":"The retrospective observational study surveys the relationship between development of inhibitors in the treatment of haemophilia patients and risk factors such as changing FVIII products. A total of 119 patients were included in this study, 198 changes of FVIII products were evaluated. During the observation period of 12 months none of the patients developed an inhibitor, which was temporally associated with a change of FVIII products. A frequent change of FVIII products didn't lead to an increase in inhibitor risk. The change between plasmatic and recombinant preparations could not be confirmed as a risk factor. Furthermore, no correlation between treatment regimens, severity, patient age and comorbidities of the patients could be found. ","515":"Thromboembolic complications may occur in patients with major operations even after routine thromboprophylaxis with low-molecular-weight-heparin. In this retrospective, single center survey the post-operative course of patients with haemophilia was investigated. Overall, the postoperative course in 85 patients with haemophilia A and B (median age: 43 years, 18-73 years) and 139 surgical procedures was analyzed. The surgical procedures mainly consist of major orthopedic surgery (58 total knee replacement, 15 hip replacement, 17 other major orthopedic surgery, 15 minor orthopedic procedures). Additional surgical procedures were abdominal-surgical (18), urological (8), neurosurgical (5). During the post-operative observation period a small number of wound healing complications occurred (4%). None of the patients developed symptomatic deep vein thrombosis or lung embolism. There seems to a decreased risk of postoperative thromboembolism in patients with haemophilia. ","516":"Antithrombin (AT), a serin protease inhibitor (serpin) produced in the liver, inhibits mainly thrombin and factor Xa. Antithrombin deficiency (AD) is associated with a higher incidence of thrombosis. We report a newborn with uncomplicated birth in the 40+5 week of gestation and postnatal appearance of a reticular, livide haematoma on the right upper arm and a tonic clonic epileptic seizure. Clinical examination revealed weak pulses in the A. radialis and ulnaris. MRI scan showed a large thrombus in the A. carotis interna and externa with large cerebral infarction and a thrombus in the A. subclavia. Laboratory work up showed elevated D-dimers and antithrombin levels &lt;20% (lowest 15%), age-related values for protein C, protein S, plasminogen, and no other inherited thrombophilia. We started anticoagulation with unfractionated heparin intravenously (aPTT: 50-60 s) and under suspicion of an AD the substitution of AT (70 U\/kg body weight). In course of time we changed anticoagulation to low molecular weight heparin (Anti Xa 0.6-0.8 U\/ml) and substitution of 250 E\/kg AT every second day. In the molecular work up we found a homozygous missense mutation in exon 2 of SERPINC1 gene (type \"Budapest 3\"). Molecular analysis showed also heterozygous mutations in both parents and a homozygous mutation in the asymptomatic brother aged three years. At age of six months we changed the anticoagulation to coumadin (INR 2.5-3.5). Anticoagulation with coumadin was also started in the brother. Hereditary AD is associated with an increased risk of thrombosis. The homozygous status mainly leads to intrauterine fetal loss or the occurrence of peri- and postnatal thrombosis. Therapy consists in the substitution of AT and a lifelong anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists also in asymptomatic patients. ","517":"It is not the blood alone! Increased loading destroys cartilage and leads to arthrosis. Reduced mechanical stimulation leads to reduced cartilage nutrition and to cartilage degeneration, which leads to arthrosis. We know about the existence of functional disturbances that occur in early childhood before any structural changes are diagnosed. This is typical for haemophilia. Those disturbances and the way movement is disturbed has a strong influence on the loading of cartilage. This involves acceleration peaks, disturbed load distribution with reduction of contact area and a change of vector direction, which leads to increased cartilage loading. The disturbed function can be analysed very early with motion analysis. Easy physiotherapeutical interventions are able to optimise function again. On top of that we have a loss of muscle contraction pattern. Around the knee joint it is the weakening of the vastus medialis and the shortening of the knee flexors. The ankle joint suffers from a weakening of the tibialis anterior and a shortening of the calf muscles. During progression of the disease there will be a shortening of the weakened muscle and a weakening of the shortened muscle as well. Kinetic superficial EMG is able to quantify the status of the muscles and enables us to prescribe an individual therapy. Subclinical influences like microbleeds, in the beginning silent synovitis, later chronic synovitis, silent symptoms and overprotection are the cause of the functional overloading of the cartilage in patient with haemophilia. Silent symptoms can be discovered by clinical examination. Again this leads to the opportunity of a symptomatic therapeutic approach. All those facts could be the reason why there is an increasing incidence of haemarthrophathy of the ankle joint, even in patients with mild haemophilia in spite of adequate factor substitution.","518":"A top quality, effective treatment of haemophilia requires an integrated therapeutical concept and an excellent cooperation of an interdisciplinary team. Since years different models are discussed in Germany in order to enlarge the offers for a suitable care of patients with hard to treat diseases. The health-political targets are expressed in the changes of the Code of Social Law number V (SGB V) and in innovations in the statutory health insurance. This new legal basis provides opportunities to implement innovative treatment concepts outside university hospitals and paves the way for ambulant haemophilia centres to offer an integral care, all legally saved by a contract.  The Coagulation Centre Rhine-Ruhr reveals as an example how haemophilia treatment in accordance with guidelines and with the latest results of international research can be realise in an ambulatory network.","519":null,"520":"Inclusive paedagogic thinking and acting is a modern and increasingly important topic in school sports. It will affect teachers as well as parents and students. The new international guidelines and national curricula enable new ways of inclusion especially for students with chronic illnesses like haemophilia. Special help from the sport teachers is of vital importance.  In our project \"fit for life\" where we advice children and young adults with haemophilia to find their appropriate sport, we developed a new approach for an optimised inclusion of children with haemophilia into sport lessons. The whole project is running in corporation with the German Sport Teachers Association\/Hessen. We analysed and rated the actual curricula of the different school years and looked at the specific needs, risks and necessary abilities for persons with haemophilia. By this means we gathered about 600 typical movements and\/or exercises for school sports and developed individual advice and adapted exercise solutions for sport lessons.","521":"76 German patients suffering from thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) were interrogated about the prevalence of co-occurring autoimmune disorders. In order to analyze a possible association of TTP with the questioned diseases, a comparison of prevalence rates between the patient group and the general population has been made for each disease. Compared to the estimated prevalence rates, the statistical analysis revealed an unexpected high occurrence of the following disorders within the patient group: Hashimoto's thyroiditis (23.5% within the patients compared to 0.7% within the general population, p&lt;0.001), systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) (6.5% in patients to 0.025% in the general population, p&lt;0.001), immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) (6.3% in patients to 0.02% in the general population, p&lt;0.001), psoriasis (9.4% in patients to 2.5% in the general population, p=0.005) and celiac disease (3.1% in patients to 0.2% in the general population, p=0.007). These findings confirm the mentioned tendency of autoimmune diseases to co-occur in one individual and argue once more for a genetic susceptibility in idiopathic TTP as well as in autoimmune disorders. ","522":"Development of FVIII inhibitors represents a major challenge in patients with mild haemophilia A (HA), because they tend to occur at an older age and classical immune tolerance induction appears to be less effective. A man (age: 60 years) with mild HA due to the missense mutation, Leu1929Arg, received a single dose of rFVIII at 35 IU\/kg prior to routine colonoscopy, totalling 25 lifetime exposure days. Two months later, rFVIII was infused for a traumatic hip haematoma. However, FVIII recovery was inappropriate, and a FVIII inhibitor of 19 BU with type-2 kinetics was detected, resulting in FVIII:C of &lt;1%. Two weeks later, the patient experienced spontaneous iliopsoas bleeding. Parallel to bypassing therapy, we started single-agent immunosuppression with prednisolone at 1.5mg\/kg. FVIII:C \"normalized\" at 10.2% after four weeks. After five months, the inhibitor titre fell to &lt;0.4 BU with sustained remission after one year of follow-up. In mild HA, FVIII inhibitors may share characteristic features with FVIII autoantibodies commonly observed in acquired HA. Therefore, immunosuppressive therapy alone could be successful at least in a subset of patients. ","523":"Recurrent abortions are a common problem. A therapy with low-molecular- weight heparin is usual in deep vein thrombosis with thrombophilia, in woman with recurrent abortions or other risks, like EPH-gestosis or HELLP-Syndrom. The efficacy of a mono-therapy with LMWH (3000-16000 daily) in women with risk pregnancies has been examined prospectively. The dates of 676 pregnant women have been analysed and compared to the current literature about live birth rates without therapy and tot he results of other, similar studies. The live birth rate has been the target variable. We obtained main a live birth rate of 98.6%. There has been no record of serious adverse effects. We obtained a live birth rate of 95.8% if NMH therapy starts early, and a live birth rate of 100% if NMH therapy starts between week 20 and 25. For the live birth rate the existence of thrombophilic gene polymorphisms is irrelevant. The high live birth weight is depended on early starting the therapy with NMH. For the late risk it is favourable to start the therapy with heparin between week 20 and 25 week of pregnancy. ","524":"An adequate number of qualified haemophilia centres is an essential requirement for effective and cost-efficient haemophilia care. During a reassessment of the delivery of haemophilia care in Germany a broad range of criteria relating to structure and quality of the centres were defined and a questionnaire was developed. Of 137 doctors who received the questionnaire, 113 (82%) replied. Based on data related to diagnostic and treatment services, together with voluntary information from PEI forms (Paul Ehrlich Institut, Germany), 72 haemophilia centres were established. Three levels of haemophilia care were defined by the Medical Advisory Council of the German Haemophilia Society. This is in accordance with criteria defined by European working parties. 17 haemophilia centres were designated CCC (Comprehensive Care Centre), 24 were designated HTC (Haemophilia Treatment Centre) and 31 smallest centres were allocated the status HTR (Haemophilia Treatment Regional). In comparison to the survey in 2007, there was only slight variance in the CCC centres (+ 2 centres\/-1 centre). From the previous HTC centres, 7 have withdrawn from this treatment level: 4 maintain treatment on the lower level HTR, and 3 centres had ceased treatment. On the HTR level of treatment, 6 of 29 (21%) had ceased to offer treatment. 9 had been able to increase the number of patients and were designated HTC. 5404 patients with haemophilia and 3047 with the severe form of haemophilia were reported. 67% were treated in CCC, 25% in haemophilia treatment centres and 8% in the 31 smallest centres. 13 of the adult CCC are situated in the department of internal medicine and 4 in the section of transfusion medicine. The survey and analysis of the haemophilia treatment centres in Germany show that the delivery of haemophilia care through 17 CCC, 24 HCT and 31 HTR appears to be adequately structured. But it is noticeable and alarming, however, that on both HTC and HTR levels of treatment, 32% and 21%, respectively, have left their treatment level. 9 centres (12.5%) have finished working in haemophilia care in the last four years. On the strength of these results, endeavours to maintain haemophilia centres must be intensified. A high level of effective care can be guaranteed only through continued existence of the centres.

Currently there are 950 patients registered, the majority of which (585) having haemophilia A. Disease severity is graded according to ISTH criteria and its distribution between mild, moderate and severe haemophilia is similar to data from other European and American registries. The majority (about two thirds) of Swiss patients with haemophilia A or B are treated on-demand, with only about 20% of patients being on prophylaxis. The figure is different in paediatrics and young adults (1st and 2nd decades), where 80 to 90% of patients with haemophilia A are under regular prophylaxis. Interestingly enough, use of factor concentrates, although readily available, is rather low in Switzerland, especially when taking the country's GDP into account: The total amount of factor VIII and IX was 4.94 U pro capita, comparable to other European countries with distinctly lower incomes (Poland, Slovakia, Hungary). This finding is mainly due to the afore mentioned low rate of prophylactic treatment of haemophilia in our country. Our registry remains an important instrument of quality control of haemophilia therapy in Switzerland.","527":"Haemophilia, a lifelong congenital bleeding disease, is a highly demanding disorder, due to the costs of its replacement therapy. In the absence of this pivotal treatment, life expectancy and quality of life are deleteriously affected. As illustration, we present a 14 years long follow-up of a patient with severe haemophilia A, treated sporadically with fresh plasma, cryoprecipitate and factor concentrates, who developed a giant iliopsoas pseudotumor. Since he was an infant, under on demand therapy with fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate and low doses of factor concentrates he presented many spontaneous bleedings, developing multiple disabling arthropathies. At the age of 14 years, an iliopsoas hematoma occurred, which relapsed several times, developing an iliopsoas pseudotumour. After 5 years, sepsis with Klebsiella was diagnosed. A CT scan revealed fistula between the pseudotumor and the gut. Under antibiotics, the evolution of sepsis improved, but over a period of 10 months 5 episodes of haematemesis and melena, followed by one episode of macroscopic haematuria occurred; two months later he developed an inguino-crural mass, which fistulized through the abdominal wall. A mixt german-romanian team solved the clinical concern. After 108 hospitalization days and consumption of 104840 IU factor VIII he left the clinic in good condition. One year later, the temporary colostomy with anus praeter was closed. The follow-up reveals now, after almost 10 years with favourable outcome, that the patient is well, active within his family and profession.","528":"For the last decades, anticoagulation for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (AF) as well as for the prophylaxis and long-term treatment of venous thromboembolism has been entirely based on vitamin K antagonists (VKA). Although very effective under optimal conditions, long-term treatment with these drugs is flawed by the fact that the time in the therapeutic range frequently is suboptimal due to biological factors, drug interactions and compliance. The direct thrombin inhibitor dabigatran, as well as the direct FXa inhibitors rivaroxaban and apixaban provide more consistent anticoagulation and have proven their efficacy and safety against VKAs in several large scale randomized clinical trials for stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation as well as for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism. In view of these convincing data and other advantages such as the lack of mandatory monitoring and only few drug interactions, VKAs will most likely be replaced in a majority of patients for these indications. Based on the most recent trial evidence, the current review discusses the role of VKA treatment and that of the novel anticoagulants.","529":null,"530":"Atopaxar, also known as E 5555 is a novel reversible protease-activated receptor-1 (PAR-1) thrombin receptor antagonist. To date, Atopaxar has been investigated in phase II trials with focus on safety and tolerability in patients with acute coronary syndromes or stable coronary artery disease on top of standard antiplatelet therapy. Atopaxar was generally well tolerated, however a rise in liver enzymes and prolongation of the QTcF interval were observed. The data suggest, that atopaxar administration may promote some minor bleeding complications, but does not seem to significantly increase the risk of major bleeding. Although not powered for efficacy, the currently available data suggest potential benefits in patients at high risk for recurrent ischemic events on top of standard antiplatelet therapy. In conclusion, more studies (e.g. phase III) are needed to evaluate efficacy and safety of atopaxar.","531":"","532":"The antithrombotic therapy in patients with atherosclerotic vascular disease is subject of several new therapeutic approaches. Simultaneous treatment with aspirin and a thienopyridin (clopidogrel) represents the standard of care for patients with acute coronary syndrome and following coronary stenting recommended by many guidelines. Without true evidence this drug combination is used for the prevention of arterial thrombosis in many other vascular interventions (e.g. carotid stenting, aortic stenting, peripherial arterial stents). The main problems of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and clopidogrel are the slow onset of action and the high interindividual variation in the degree of platelet inhibition. The thienopyridin prasugrel is a more potent platelet inhibitor with a more rapid onset of action and smaller interindividual variations in platelet inhibition. The therapeutic superiority of prasugrel with respect to coronary events and stent thromboses was proven in patients with acute coronary syndrome undergoing coronary interventions. Specifically patients with Diabetes mellitus and patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction seemed to benefit most due to the improved inhibition of platelet activity. A higher rate of bleeding complications was seen in those over the age of 75 years and a body weight below 60 kg for which a daily dose of 5mg\/day was approved. Further clinical studies with prasugrel in patients with non-invasively treated acute coronary syndromes are ongoing.","533":"Edoxaban (the former DU176b) an orally available direct factor Xa inhibitor has been engineered from DX-9065a, which was one of the first parenteral Xa inhibitors. Edoxaban has a time to peak plasma concentrations of 1-2 hours and a half-life of approximately 10 hours after multiple doses. Edoxaban is the third new oral anticoagulant in the group of direct factor Xa inhibitors that has gained clinical approval for the prevention of venous thromboembolism after major orthopaedic surgery. Currently, edoxaban is assessed in late stage clinical development for the prevention of stroke and systemic embolism in patients with non-valvular atrial fibrillation (ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48, NCT00781391) and for the treatment and prevention of venous thromboembolism in patients with acute deep vein thrombosis and\/or pulmonary embolism (HOKUSAI VTE, NCT00986154).  Both clinical phase III trials represent the largest single clinical studies in their entity so far with an enrolment of 21107 patients in ENGAGE AF-TIMI 48 and a planned enrolment of 7500 patients in HOKUSAI VTE.  The pharmacological properties of edoxaban will be discussed along with the current late stage clinical development focusing on the prevention of stroke and venous thromboembolism.","534":"Vorapaxar is the first substance of a new class of antiplatelet drugs that has been tested in large clinical trials. The protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1) antagonist inhibits thrombin-induced platelet activation to prevent atherothrombosis. In the phase 3 trials TRACER (acute coronary syndrome) and TRA 2P-TIMI 50 (stable atherosclerosis) reducing ischemic events with vorapaxar came at the cost of bleeding. TRACER compared vorapaxar to placebo in 12,944 patients who had non-ST-segment elevation acute coronary syndromes on top of contemporary treatment including dual antiplatelet therapy (aspirin and clopidogrel). Vorapaxar reduced ischemic events non-significantly, but increased bleeding significantly, therefore not justifying triple antiplatelet therapy in this setting. Follow-up was stopped early because of bleeding. TRA 2P-TIMI 50 examined 26,449 patients who had a history of myocardial infarction, ischemic stroke, or peripheral arterial disease. Vorapaxar reduced ischemic events and increased bleeding both significantly. Recruitment of patients with prior stroke was stopped early. Net clinical outcome and subgroup analyses suggested that vorapaxar could be beneficial for patients with prior myocardial infarction - but no history of stroke.","535":null,"536":"The antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and the ADP-receptor blocker clopidogrel is currently the standard medication after coronary intervention or after acute coronary syndrome to prevent recurrent ischemic events and reduce mortality. However, high interindividual response variability to antiplatelet treatment is described in up to 44% of treated patients. A poor response to clopidogrel is caused by multifactorial mechanisms. Individual risk assessment including platelet function testing (PFT) can help to identify high risk patients, although recent randomized trials to investigate effects of PFT-guided therapy have failed to detect an impact on prognostic outcome. Poor response to standard antiplatelet agents can be overcome by switching to alternate substances. Elinogrel is a novel competitive, reversible ADP-receptor antagonist available in oral and intravenous formulation. Additional treatment with elinogrel showed advantages over clopidogrel, including more rapid, less variable, and more complete inhibition of platelet function without significantly increased bleeding complications. This review gives an overview over the investigational drug elinogrel for use in a personalized antiplatelet approach.","537":"Apixaban is a potent reversible inhibitor of the activated human coagulation factor X. This new oral anticoagulant has favourable pharmacokinetic and pharmocodynamic properties which include a concentration-dependent anticoagulant effect, good oral bioavailability, balanced elimination and excretion, infrequent drug or food interactions, and the lack of liver toxicity. Apixaban has already completed a large part of its phase 3 clinical trial programme. In the ARISTOTLE study, which focused on stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation, apixaban showed a balanced efficacy and safety profile, being superior to warfarin both in the prevention of strokes and in the risk of causing major bleeding. A further trial related to this indication, AVERROES, demonstrated the clear superiority of apixaban compared to aspirin treatment. In the primary prophylaxis of venous thromboembolism after orthopaedic surgery, apixaban successfully completed the ADVANCE study programme and was approved in Europe for patients undergoing elective hip or knee replacement. The results of the AMPLIFY and AMPLIFY-EXT studies will soon show whether the inhibitor is also effective in the treatment and secondary prophylaxis after acute deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism. On the other hand, the use of apixaban in the primary prophylaxis of venous thrombosis in hospitalised medical patients, and its administration on top of antiplatelet therapy to patients who have suffered an acute coronary syndrome, have not received support by the results of ADOPT and APPRAISE-II, respectively. In conclusion, on the basis of the available evidence, apixaban appears to be a valuable therapeutic option for the prevention of venous thrombosis and embolic stroke.","538":"Ticagrelor, a cyclopentyltriazolopyrimidine (CPTP), is the representative of a new chemical class of P2Y(12) receptor inhibitors that differ from thienopyridines (ticlopidin, clopidogrel, prasugrel) as ticagrelor is not a prodrug requiring active biotransformation by cytochromes in the liver and thus is characterized by a more rapid, more effective and more consistent platelet inhibition than ticlopidin or clopidogrel. An extensive study program for dose finding and safety for AZD6140 (DISPERSE studies) and a large-scaled phase III trial (PLATO) were undertaken on more than 18,000 patients for validation of efficacy and safety. In the PLATO trial, patients presenting with the broad spectrum of ACS, i.e. unstable angina, non-STEMI or STEMI, were randomized to ticagrelor (Brilique, Brilinta) or clopidogrel within 24 hours after onset of symptoms, regardless whether they were allocated to a planned invasive or conservative treatment. Compared to clopidogrel, ticagrelor reduced rates of the primary endpoint consisting of cardiovascular death, non-fatal MI, or stroke, without an excess of the primary safety endpoint that was PLATO-defined major bleedings. Results from the pre-specified confirmatory subgroup of patients undergoing planned invasive treatment was consistent with PLATO main trial. In addition, the primary endpoint, as well as CV death and all cause death were consistently reduced with ticagrelor in numerous exploratory subgroups including STEMI patients, those planned for non-invasive treatment, patients undergoing CABG, patients with renal failure, and those with diabetes mellitus, although patients were pretreated before coronary angiography and patients with clopidogrel pretreatment were not excluded. The pharmacological properties and convincing study results of the PLATO trial have stimulated a paradigm change for dual antiplatelet therapy. The new ESC guidelines on the management of ACS without ST segment elevation recommend the use of clopidogrel only when a new antiplatelet drug, e.g. ticagrelor or prasugrel is not available or contraindicated. ","539":"Dabigatran is a novel direct thrombin inhibitor that has recently been approved for primary and secondary stroke prevention and prevention of systemic embolism in patients with atrial fibrillation. In the pivotal RE-LY study, dabigatran 110 mg BID was demonstrated to be associated with a stroke rate similar to that observed with warfarin (INR target 2.0 to 3.0), but with a lower rate of major haemorrhage. Dabigatran administered at a dose of 150 mg BID was significantly more effective in stroke prevention than warfarin and showed a similar rate of major hemorrhages. Of note, both dosages resulted in an approximately 60-70% relative risk reduction of haemorrhagic stroke. The dosage of 110 mg BID should be preferably used in patients aged 75-80 years or older as the rate of extracranial bleeding events tends to increase with dabigatran 150 mg BID above this age limit. In RE-LY, myocardial infarcts occurred at a very low incidence. There were numerically more myocardial infarcts in dabigatran-treated patients than in warfarin patients; however, other myocardial ischaemic events were similar in the three treatment arms.","540":"","541":"","542":"","543":"Atherosclerotic diseases such as coronary artery disease and ischaemic stroke are caused by chronic inflammation in arterial vessel walls. The complement system is part of the innate immune system. It is involved in many processes contributing to onset and development of atherosclerotic plaques up to the final stage of acute thrombotic events. This is due to its prominent role in inflammatory processes. In addition, there is increasing evidence that interactions between complement and coagulation provide a link between inflammation and thrombosis. On the other hand, the complement system also has an atheroprotective function through the clearance of apoptotic material.  The knowledge of these complex mechanisms will become increasingly important, also for clinicians, since it may lead to novel therapeutic and diagnostic options. Therapies targeting the complement system have the potential to reduce tissue damage caused by acute ischaemic events. Whether early anti-inflammatory and anti-complement therapy may be able to prevent atherosclerosis, remains a hot topic for research.","544":"The clinical relevance of thrombophilia screening in stroke patients is still a matter of debate, and descriptions of larger patterns of genetic variability are rare. We assessed the frequency of hereditary hypercoagulability in young patients with cryptogenic stroke (n = 44) and in healthy blood donors (n = 282) without prior cardiovascular event. Furthermore, we focused on the impact of thrombophilia screening on secondary stroke prevention. Compared to the control group (19-67 years; median 38.5 years; 64% women), there was a lower prevalence of the FVII-R353Q mutation (p = 0.033) in stroke patients (17-52 years; median 36 years; 59.1% women). Of note, the FVII-R353Q mutation lowers FVII plasma levels, probably reducing the risk of cardiovascular events. The prevalence of the remaining 13 gene polymorphisms did not differ significantly. However, the prevalence of FV Leiden mutation tended to be higher among stroke patients. Overall, extended screening for inherited thrombophilia had an impact on medical stroke prevention in every sixth patient with cryptogenic stroke. ","545":"In contrast to children with haemophilia the scientific evidence of prophylaxis treatment in adults is not yet proven. Existing studies are of observational character and mostly retrospectively designed. Therefore, opinion leaders in this field postulate prospectively designed, randomized, controlled and multicentric studies to set up urgently needed guidelines. Evidence according to the Canadian task force ranking is assessed as level III with a recommendation grade C by the authors. The recognition of benefits of health care providers in accordance with the German Federal Joint Committee generally demands a Grade-Ia to Ib evidence. As long as the actual evidence of prophylaxis in adult haemophiliacs does not meet the postulated criteria of the German Federal Joint Committee, prophylactic replacement therapy of the individual case has to be well documented and reasonably explained.","546":"Mild bleeding disorders (BD) such as von Willebrand disease (VWD) type I are often difficult to diagnose because of inconclusive laboratory results. Our study examines the diagnostic value of repeated testing. Prospective study on 200 children. Extensive laboratory testing was done twice and a standardized history was taken. 165 patients completed the study (median age 5.6 years). Main reason for referral was aPTT prolongation (n = 109). The initial diagnosis was upheld in 74\/165 (44.8%) children. Of 18 patients rated normal, 8 had to be reclassified as possible VWD later. Ten patients were diagnosed VWD I. In 36 patients possible VWD was found, 13 of these had normal results at the second visit while in 6 VWD became more likely. The main diagnosis was lupus-anticoagulant (n=79), normalizing in 24. A total of 88 children underwent surgery during the study period. Our study shows frequent changes in the diagnosis and highlights the limitations of single laboratory tests in detecting mild BD. Clinical and laboratory abnormalities have to be followed and tests must be repeated in unclear cases. Normal values at one point do not exclude a BD.

We retrospectively compare medical and psychosocial data of 15 HIV+ long term survivors (L-S), 15 HIV+ later on deceased patients and 15 HIV-, all of them deriving from the original investigation group from 1985 including 52 patients (30 HIV+, 22 HIV-). We prove the validity of our psychosocial factors by the SF 36 which currently serves as gold standard. The actual psychosocial factors and medical parameters of the 15 L-S are checked against the data of the 15 HIV- patients. In 1985 already, we retrospectively found significantly higher values regarding psychosocial factors within the group of the L-S as opposed to the later on deceased ones. Highly significant are the facts that more than 90 % of HIV+ L-S have had a good relationship to their fathers and are still employed today in contrast to the deceased HIV+ patients. At present, the differences regarding psychosocial factors between HIV+ L-S and HIV-negative patients are vanishing. ","549":null,"550":"Electromyography (EMG) measures muscle electricity. It depends on muscle contraction and central motor control. Muscles react very sensitive on external signals (e. g. bleeding), The resulting changes can be shown in EMG. A first study included 51 children and young adults from Costa Rica. They underwent a clinical examination and EMG of the hip, knee and ankle joints. Resting muscle tone, maximal isometric contraction and three typical isotonic movements of the joints were measured. First step of analysis was to characterize typical pathogenic changes in the muscles and to find a corresponding physical therapy to minimize these changes. It showed that EMG is a good marker for muscle condition. It helps to individualize therapy and improve effectivity of physical and physiotherapeutic treatment of the locomotive system of children and young adults with hemophilia. It can help to recognize early subclinical changes and to control the outcome of therapeutic modalities.

In several haemophiliacs, diagnostic analyses for detection of these inversions revealed unusual band patterns. Upon further examination, different copy number variations were detected in the factor VIII gene of these patients by multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA). Since these duplications or deletions alone could not sufficiently explain the abnormal band patterns of the first analyses, we assumed a combination of intron 1 or intron 22 inversions together with a copy number variation. We could confirm this hypothesis by specific long range PCRs but a detailed characterization of the breakpoints and the mechanisms for these complex rearrangements have yet to be elucidated.

Median observation was 19 years for patients with haemophilia A and 9,5 years for carriers. FVIII:C levels collected from patients with mild haemophilia A displayed a significant median increase of 6.5% with proceeding age (p = 0.0013). Patients with moderate haemophilia A (and carriers of haemophilia A) showed a non significant median increase of 1.05% (carriers 8%).

The centre's large service area is, in part, due to the introduction of haemophilia home treatment and related to this the individualized prophylaxis in children and adults by Egli and Brackmann in Bonn in the early 1970s, that represented a milestone in German haemophilia therapy. Epidemiologic patient data from the two selected time points, 1980 and 2009, are evaluated to illustrate the change in the composition of the patient clientele. In 1980 a total of 639 patients were treated at the Bonn Haemophilia Center. 529 patients exhibited a severe form and 110 a non-severe form of the respective clotting disorder. In 2009 the Bonn Haemophilia Center took care for a total of 837 patients. There were 445 patients who suffered from a severe form of the considered clotting disorder while 392 showed a non-severe course. The number of less severely affected patients has increased significantly in 2009. Patients in 1980 were predominantly suffering from a severe form and most had to travel more than 150 km from their homes to the treatment center. In 2009 the number of patients living a medium-long distance from the care provider has significantly increased while the number of patients living more than 150 km from the center has decreased. Comparing 2009 to 1980 a growth of the center's regional character becomes apparent, especially when patient age and severity of the coagulation disorder are taken into consideration. The regional character was more strongly pronounced with milder disease severity and lower patient age. Due to the existence of well established primary haemophilia care in CCCs in Germany, the trend for the recent years is that the proportion of young patients that choose haemophilia care providers closer to their homes is increasing.","560":"Factor VII-activating protease (FSAP) is a serine protease in plasma that has a role in coagulation and fibrinolysis. FVII could be activated by purified FSAP in a tissue factor independent manner and pro-urokinase has been demonstrated to be a substrate for purified FSAP in-vitro. However, the physiological role of FSAP in haemostasis remains unclear. More recently FSAP is suggested to be involved in inflammation. It modulates vascular permeability directly and indirectly by the generation of bradykinin. Furthermore, FSAP is activated by dead cells induced by the inflammatory response and subsequently removes nucleosomes from apoptotic cells. FSAP activation can be detected in sepsis patients as well. However, whether FSAP activation upon inflammation is beneficial or detrimental remains an open question.  In this review the structure, activation mechanisms and the possible role of FSAP in inflammation are discussed.","561":"The diagnosis of venous thromboembolism has evolved considerably with the development of standardized diagnostic algorithms that include clinical probability assessment, D-dimer measurement and the use of non-invasive imaging modalities such as compression ultrasonography and computed tomography angiography. The implementation of these strategies aims to improve resource allocation and patient outcome. The judicious use of these diagnostic tools requires a thorough knowledge of the appropriate clinical setting in which every test and strategy is efficient and can be used safely. For this purpose, D-dimer measurement and compression ultrasonography are complementary: the former is mainly used to exclude VTE in selected patients, while the latter is used to confirm the presence of an underlying DVT.  This review provides an appraisal of the features and use of D-dimer and compression ultrasonography in the context of suspected venous thromboembolism.","562":null,"563":null,"564":null,"565":null,"566":"","567":"","568":"In women, von Willebrand disease (VWD) is the most common inherited bleeding disorder. Since VWD and other inherited bleeding disorders are autosomal disorders, they affect women and men. Menorrhagia, or heavy menstrual bleeding (HMB), is the most common symptom of women with bleeding disorder experience. Objectively, it is defined as bleeding that lasts for more than seven days or results in the loss of more than 80 ml of blood per menstrual cycle. The prevalence of menorrhagia in a woman with a bleeding disorder ranges from 32 to 100% in patients with VWD, from 5 to 98% in patients with a platelet dysfunction and from 35 to 70% in women with a rare factor deficiency. A detailed history and a careful physical exam are the first steps towards a diagnosis in adolescents, adding a PBAC&gt;100 increased the sensitivity of the screening tool further to 95%. Laboratory testing should be made at the time of menstrual bleeding in an effort to capture the lowest level of VWF:Ag and FVIII:C.  Treatment options  for menorrhagia in VWD: (1) antifibrinolytic therapy with tranexamic acid, (2) the non-transfusional agent desmopressin (DDAVP), (3) purified blood products that contain factor VIII and VWF concentrated from plasma and (4) hormonal preparations.","569":"Atrial fibrillation is one of the most frequent reasons for therapeutic anticoagulation in everyday practice. Oral vitamin K antagonists such as Marcumar have been state of the art anticoagulants to prevent thrombembolic events in patients with atrial fibrillation and additional risk factors. But these drugs are accompanied by disadvantages such as increased bleeding risk and impaired quality of life caused by interactions with food or other medications as well as frequent controls of INRs.  The new anticoagulants apixaban, rivaroxaban and dabigatran are direct antagonists of coagulation factors (FXa or FIIa) and demonstrate a promising risk\/benefit profile in large clinical trials compared with vitamin K antagonists. Their approval for clinical use will open up new therapeutic perspectives for patients with atrial fibrillation and indication for anticoagulation.","570":"Allogeneic and autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantations are important therapeutic options for patients with hematologic disorders. Hemostatic complications are frequent after hematopoietic stem cell transplantation with a considerable morbidity and mortality. The incidence of bleedings and thrombosis is highest in the first few weeks after transplantation, but may also occur later. However, beyond the first year of transplantation only limited data are available. In long-term survivors the risk for premature atherosclerosis increases over time after allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation and it is higher than in the age-adjusted general population and in recipients of autologous transplantation.","571":"Nucleic acid based aptamers are single-stranded oligonucleotide ligands isolated from random libraries by an in-vitro selection procedure. Through the formation of unique three-dimensional structures, aptamers are able to selectively interact with a variety of target molecules and are therefore also promising candidates for the development of anticoagulant drugs. While thrombin represents the most prominent enzymatic target in this field, also aptamers directed against other coagulation proteins and proteases have been identified with some currently being tested in clinical trials.  In this review, we summarize recent developments in the design and evaluation of aptamers for anticoagulant therapy and research.","572":"Mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) represent a stem and progenitor cell population that has been shown to promote tissue recovery in pre-clinical and clinical studies. The study of MSC migration following systemic infusion of exogenous MSC is difficult. The challenges facing these efforts are due to a number of factors, including defining culture conditions for MSC, the phenotype of cultured MSC, the differences observed between cultured MSC and freshly isolated MSC. However, even if, MSC populations consist of a mixture of stem and more committed multipotent progenitors, it remains probable that these cell populations are still useful in the clinic as discussed in this review.","573":"Acute venous thromboembolism (VTE) is treated with parenteral administration of heparin or derivatives, in conjunction with oral vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) to reach and maintain INR values between 2.0 and 3.0 for at least 3 months; the duration of a further period of treatment for secondary prevention of recurrences is still matter of debate. If bleeding occurs during treatment the decision will be based on: a) type of bleeding (major or minor), and b) thrombotic risk if anticoagulation is withheld (characteristics of patients and time elapsed from the index VTE). In case of major bleeding anticoagulation should be stopped and reversed. A first but insufficient measure is i.v. vitamin K administration. Fresh frozen plasma is widely used; however, large volumes are needed (at least 15 mL\/kg body weight) with risk for fluid overload. Prothrombin complex concentrate infusion, with 3 or (better) the 4 pro-coagulant factors, is a more efficient (fast and safe) measure. In patients at high thrombotic risk (first month or other conditions) and absolute contraindication for anticoagulation a caval filter is recommended, to avoid as much as possible life-threatening pulmonary embolism.","574":"Ambient environmental air pollutants include gaseous and particulate components. In polluted air, especially particulate matter seems responsible for cardiovascular complications: It consists of a heterogeneous mixture of solid and liquid particles with different diameters ranging from large thoracic to ultrafine particles, with a diameter &lt;100 nm. Ultrafines can penetrate deeply into the lung to deposit in the alveoli. Cardiovascular manifestations result both from short-term and long-term exposure and have been linked to interference with the autonomic nervous system, direct translocation into the systemic circulation, pulmonary inflammation and oxidative stress. Thrombotic complications associated with air pollution comprise arterial and probably venous thrombogenicity.  This review describes the existing epidemiological and experimental evidence to explain the rapid induction of myocardial infarction within 1-2 hours after exposure to polluted air and advances several explanations as to why more chronic exposure will lead to enhanced venous thrombogenicity. Mechanisms such as platelet activation, endothelial dysfunction, coagulation factor changes and microvesicle production are discussed.","575":"Trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) has been considered for a long time as being due to depletion of coagulation factors secondary to blood loss, dilution and consumption. Dysfunction of the remaining coagulation factors due to hypothermia and acidosis is assumed to additionally contribute to TIC. Recent data suggest that hyperfibrinolysis (HF) represents an additional important confounder to the disturbed coagulation process. Severe shock and major tissue trauma are the main drivers of this HF. The incidence of HF is still speculative. According to visco-elastic testing of trauma patients upon emergency room admission, HF is present in approximately 2.5-7% of all trauma patients. However, visco-elastic tests provide information on severe forms of HF only. Occult HF seems to be much more common but diagnosis is still challenging. Results from a recent randomized, placebo-controlled trial suggest that the early treatment of trauma patients with tranexamic acid may result in a significant reduction of trauma-associated mortality.","576":"About 3.2 million women in Germany are between 14 and 19 years old representing about 19% of women. 55% of them use combined oral contraception (COC). The risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) during the use of COC is increased 2-6 times. For thrombophilic patients depending on the kind of thrombophilic defect it is much higher. Pregnancy and postpartum period lead to a much higher increase of VTE than any COC use at all, both in women with and without thrombophilic defect. VTE risk in COC is highly dependent on the content of ethinylestradiol (EE) and the kind of progestagen used in COC. Progestagen-only contraceptives (POC) do not increase the VTE risk, since they do not activate the coagulation system. It is not justified to withhold any hormonal contraception to thrombophilic women, especially considering the much higher VTE risk in (maybe unintended) pregnancy. Adolescents thrombophilic women should rather be informed about the opportunity to use POC. ","577":"The transplantation of allogeneic or autologous haematopoietic stem cells is an established treatment for many malignant and non-malignant diseases of the bone marrow. Intensive cytoreductive regimens administered before transplantation induce prolonged and severe cytopenia of all haematopoietic lineages. Thrombocytopenia leads to an increased risk of bleeding, which may be further aggravated by consumption of plasmatic factors as a result of tumour lysis or after antibody administration. At the same time, patients after transplantation are also at increased risk of thrombotic complications. Endothelial damage induced by radio- and chemotherapy, indwelling catheters, prolonged immobilization and a high incidence of systemic infection all contribute to the frequent occurrence of thromboembolic events in this population.  This review discusses the incidence and risk factors for haemorrhagic and thrombotic complications after stem cell transplantation. Special emphasis is given to complications occurring specifically in the context of transplantation such as diffuse alveolar haemorrhage, haemorrhagic cystitis, veno-occlusive disease, and transplant associated microangiopathy.","578":null,"579":"Cancer is associated with a fourfold increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE). The risk of VTE varies according to the type of malignancy (i. e. pancreatic cancer, brain cancer, lymphoma) and its disease stage and individual factors (i. e. sex, race, age, previous VTE history, immobilization, obesity). Preventing cancer-associated VTE is important because it represents a significant cause of morbidity and mortality. In order to identify cancer patient at particularly high risk, who need thromboprophylaxis, risk prediction models have become available and are under validation. These models include clinical risk factors, but also begin to incorporate biological markers. The major American and European scientific societies have issued their recommendations to guide the management of VTE in patients with cancer.  In this review the principal aspects of epidemiology, risk factors and outcome of cancer-associated VTE are summarized.","580":"","581":null,"582":"Etiological concepts on cancer development, malignant growth and tumour propagation have undergone a revolutionary development during recent years: Among other aspects, the discovery of angiogenesis - the growth of new blood vessels from pre-existing vasculature - as a key element in the pathogenesis of malignancy has opened an abundance of biologic insights and subsequent therapeutic options, which have led to improved prognosis in many cancers including those originating from colon, lung, breast and kidney. Thereby, targeting the major pro-angiogenic stimulus vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) became the focus for therapeutic interventions. However, the use of VEGF-targeting drugs has been shown to be of limited efficacy, which might lie in the fact that tumor angiogenesis is mediated by a variety of different subcellular systems.  This review focuses on the basic mechanisms involved in angiogenesis, which potentially represent novel targets for pharmacological agents in the treatment of malignancies.","583":"The central effector protease of the protein C pathway, activated protein C (APC), interacts with the endothelial cell protein C receptor, with protease activated receptors (PAR), the apolipoprotein E2 receptor, and integrins to exert multiple effects on haemostasis and immune cell function. Such receptor interactions modify the activation of PC and determine the biological response to endogenous and therapeutically administered APC. This review summarizes the current knowledge about interactions of APC with cell surface-associated receptors, novel substrates such as histones and tissue factor pathway inhibitor, and their implications for the biologic function of APC in the control of coagulation and inflammation.","584":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a common complication in patients with cancer that causes significant morbidity and mortality. Several patient-, tumour- and treatment-related risk factors for VTE in cancer patients have been identified. An effective and safe thromboprophylaxis in cancer patients at high risk of VTE is desirable. Recently, the identification of potential biomarkers and the development of risk scoring models for prediction of cancer-associated VTE have been published. Whether primary VTE prophylaxis based on risk assessment through these biomarkers and risk prediction models might be useful, is currently not yet known. However, thromboprophylaxis is clearly indicated in high-risk situations. While VTE prophylaxis is recommended in cancer patients undergoing surgery and in hospitalised patients with acute disease, studies in ambulatory cancer patients are still rare and evidence for primary VTE prophylaxis is currently limited. In this review, risk factors associated with VTE in cancer patients and current approaches of thromboprophylaxis in different settings, specifically in ambulatory cancer patients are subjected to a critical evaluation.","585":"Cancer is a major and independent risk factor of venous thromboembolism (VTE). In clinical practice, a high number of VTE events occurs in patients with cancer, and treatment of cancer-associated VTE differs in several aspects from treatment of VTE in the general population. However, treatment in cancer patients remains a major challenge, as the risk of recurrence of VTE as well as the risk of major bleeding during anticoagulation is substantially higher in patients with cancer than in those without cancer. In several clinical trials, different anticoagulants and regimens have been investigated for treatment of acute VTE and secondary prophylaxis in cancer patients to prevent recurrence. Based on the results of these trials, anticoagulant therapy with low-molecular-weight heparins (LMWH) has become the treatment of choice in cancer patients with acute VTE in the initial period and for extended and long-term anticoagulation for 3-6 months. New oral anticoagulants directly inhibiting thrombin or factor Xa, have been developed in the past decade and studied in large phase III clinical trials. Results from currently completed trials are promising and indicate their potential use for treatment of VTE also in cancer patients. However, the role of the new oral thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors for VTE treatment in cancer patients still has to be clarified in further studies specifically focusing on cancer-associated VTE.  This brief review will summarize the current strategies of initial and long-term VTE treatment in patients with cancer and discuss the potential use of the new oral anticoagulants.","586":"Cancer is characterized by bidirectional interrelations between tumour progression, coagulation activation, and inflammation. Tissue factor (TF), the principal initiator of the coagulation protease cascade, is centrally positioned in this complex triangular network due to its pleiotropic effects in haemostasis, angiogenesis, and haematogenous metastasis. While formation of macroscopic thrombi is the correlate of cancer-associated venous thromboembolism (VTE), a major healthcare burden in clinical haematology and oncology, microvascular thrombosis appears to be critically important to blood-borne tumour cell dissemination. In this regard, expression of TF in malignant tissues as well as shedding of TF-bearing microparticles into the circulation are thought to be regulated by defined genetic events relevant to pathological cancer progression, thus directly linking Trousseau's syndrome to molecular tumourigenesis.  Because pharmacological inhibition of the TF pathway in selective tumour types and patient subgroups would be in line with the modern concept of individualized, targeted anti-cancer therapy, this review will focus on the role of TF in tumour biology and cancer-associated VTE.","587":null,"588":"Cancer patients have a four- to seven-fold increased risk to develop a venous thromboembolic event. Accumulating evidence from experimental and clinical studies indicates that microparticles (MPs), small procoagulant membrane vesicles that are defined by size and a negatively charged phosphatidylserine rich surface, play an important role in the pathogenesis of cancer-related venous thromboembolism (VTE). However, the clinical significance of MPs as a predictive biomarker for VTE in cancer patients has not been fully elucidated yet. This might be due to unresolved methodological problems and a lack of data from large prospective clinical studies that investigate the role of MPs in cancer-related VTE.  It is the aim of this review to give an overview on the most important characteristics of MPs and studies dealing with the role of MPs in cancer-related VTE. Also recent progresses, unresolved problems and future perspectives in this research field will be discussed. In the conclusion we will assess the clinical significance of MPs in cancer-related VTE.","589":"Vitamin K was discovered early last century at the same time as the vitamin K-antagonists. For many years the role of vitamin K was solely ascribed to coagulation and coagulation was thought to be involved only at the venous blood side. This view has dramatically changed with the discovery of vitamin K-dependent proteins outside the coagulation cascade and the role of coagulation factors at the arterial side. Vitamin K-dependent proteins are involved in the regulation of vascular smooth muscle cell migration, apoptosis, and calcification. Vascular calcification has become an important independent predictor of cardiovascular disease. Vitamin K-antagonists induce inactivity of inhibitors of vascular calcification, leading to accelerated calcification. The involvement of vitamin K-dependent proteins such as MGP in vascular calcification make that calcification is amendable for intervention with high intake of vitamin K. This review focuses on the effect of vitamin K-dependent proteins in vascular disease.","590":"Anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists (VKAs) is effective in the prevention and treatment of thrombotic complications in many clinical conditions, including atrial fibrillation (that represents today the most frequent indication for anticoagulant treatment), venous thromboembolism, acute coronary syndromes and after invasive cardiac procedures. Bleeding is the most important complication of VKAs and a major concern for both physicians and patients, limiting a more widespread prescription of the treatment. As a result, a non negligible proportion of all the subjects who would have a clear clinical indication for anticoagulation do not receive an effective treatment.  This review analyses the treatment- and person-associated risk factors for bleeding during VKAs. New oral anticoagulant drugs seems to overcome at least some of the limitations of VKAs. Potentially, they can allow a less demanding and more stable anticoagulant treatment, with less side-effects allowing that more patients can receive an appropriate anticoagulant treatment. Based on the so far available phase III clinical studies, it is possible to assume that these new drugs are associated with a risk of bleeding, that is probably related to the intensity of treatment.","591":"Many more platelets are present in healthy mammals than are necessary for routine haemostasis. Thus, they could have other functions. Platelets have many of the attributes of innate immune function including Toll-like receptors. They also contain a wide range of anti-microbial peptides in storage granules. Platelets play an important role in bacterial infections, both in disease progress and in defence mechanisms depending on circumstances. Similar mechanisms are used in defence against fungi. Platelets are also involved in viral diseases, either in protecting from the immune system or in killing viruses that activate platelets. Finally, platelets have a role in defence against parasitic diseases, in particular malaria, that should not be ignored, and may aggravate some of the worst aspects. Platelets also have receptors for IgE and are implicated via parasitic disorders in development and problems of allergy.","592":"Protein Z (PZ) is a vitamin K-dependent factor identified in human plasma in 1984 but it has no enzymatic activity. It is a cofactor of a serpin, the protein Z-dependent protease inhibitor (ZPI), and the complex PZ\/ZPI inhibits activated factor X on phospholipid surfaces. In mice, the disruption of PZ or ZPI gene is asymptomatic, but enhances the thrombotic phenotype and mortality of other thrombotic risk factors. Most of the clinical studies focused on PZ. Despite conflicting results, a recent meta-analysis indicated that PZ deficiency could be a risk for venous and arterial thrombosis and early fetal loss. However, these conclusions are drawn from case-control studies of small size, constituting an important limitation. Recently, it was shown that PZ and\/or ZPI are synthesised by normal kidney and different cancer cells, suggesting that the complex PZ\/ZPI could play a role in inhibiting the tissue deposition of fibrin. The physiopathological consequences of these observations remain to be established. At this time, the measurement of plasma PZ and ZPI or analysis of their gene polymorphisms should not be performed routinely for the exploration of thrombophilia.","593":"Coagulation proteases control cellular homeostasis beyond haemostasis. While the role of coagulation proteases in regulating vascular healing and thrombosis is well established, the mechanism underlying the receptor-dependent regulation of cellular function remain incompletely understood. In particular, the opposing effects of the protease-activated receptor 1 (PAR-1), dependent on the activating proteases thrombin or activated protein C generated a conundrum researchers only recently have begun to decipher. The net-effect (cellular perturbation vs. cellular protection) depends on co-receptors involved, the concentration of the activating protease, the temporal context of receptor activation, and a dynamic process of receptor rearrangement upon receptor activation. The latter scenario recruits receptors to a cytoprotective signalling pathways. Recent insights into these mechanisms are summarized in this article.","594":"Anticoagulants are effective in the prevention and treatment of a variety of arterial and venous thrombotic disorders but are associated with an increased risk of serious bleeding complications. Based on well documented studies of patients using vitamin K antagonists the incidence of major bleeding is 0.5%\/year and the incidence of intracranial bleeding is 0.2%\/year, however, in real life practice this incidence may be even higher. Risk factors for bleeding are the intensity of anticoagulation, the management strategy to keep the anticoagulant effect in the desired range, and patient characteristics. Recently, a new generation of anticoagulants have been developed and is currently evaluated in clinical trials. Initial results show a similar or superior efficacy over conventional anticoagulant agents with a good safety profile. In case of serious bleeding complications in a patient who uses vitamin K antagonists, this anticoagulant treatment can be quickly reversed by administration of vitamin K or coagulation factor concentrates. For the newer anticoagulants, quick reversal strategies are more cumbersome, although some interventions, including prothrombin complex concentrates, show promising results in initial experimental studies.","595":"Factor VII activating protease (FSAP) is a circulating serine protease with high homology to fibrinolytic enzymes. A role in the regulation of coagulation and fibrinolysis is suspected based on in vitro studies demonstrating activation of FVII or pro-urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA). However, considering the paucity of any studies in animal models or any correlative studies in humans the role of FSAP in haemostasis remains unclear. In relation to vascular remodeling processes or inflammation it has been convincingly shown that FSAP interacts with growth factors as well as protease activated receptors (PAR). Against this sparse background there are a plethora of studies which have investigated the linkage of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNP) in the FSAP gene (HABP2) to various diseases. The G534E SNP of FSAP is associated with a low proteolytic activity due to an amino acid exchange in the protease domain. This and other SNPs have been linked to carotid stenosis, stroke as well as thrombosis in the elderly and plaque calcification. These SNP analyses indicate an important role for FSAP in the regulation of the haemostasis system as well as fibroproliferative inflammatory processes.","596":"Overexpression of plasma cell membrane glycoprotein-1 (PC-1) inhibits insulin receptor tyrosine kinase activity and thus favours insulin resistance and atherosclerotic vascular disease. Recent findings indicate that the minor variant K121Q in the PC-1 gene confers an increased risk for early myocardial infarction independent of other established risk factors. We hypothesized that genetic variants in PC-1 may also influence the risk for cerebrovascular disease. Therefore, we assessed the association of the PC-1 K121Q variant in the coding region and a polymorphism (G2906C) in the 3' untranslated region of the PC-1 gene with the risk of stroke. We analyzed 1014 patients with a history of ischaemic stroke from the Vienna stroke registry and 1001 control individuals without vascular disease. Genotype frequencies of both genetic variants were similar in patients and controls in the total study population. By multivariate analysis, no interactions were observed between the PC-1 genotype and established vascular risk factors. However, the PC-1 2906C allele was significantly more frequent in patients who suffered from stroke before the age of 40 years. In these patients the risk for ischaemic stroke was increased four-fold. ","597":null,"598":"Screening of platelet function can be performed by point-of-care testing followed by platelet aggregometry in response to agonists such as collagen, adenosine diphosphate, epinephrine, and arachidonic acid. Despite in use for decades, this technique is not well standardized. Monitoring of antiplatelet therapy is increasingly applied in patients at high risk for re-thrombosis or bleeding. To assess pharmacological inhibition of platelet function, agonist-induced platelet aggregation, thromboxane B2 (TxB2) and vasodilator-stimulated protein phosphorylation (VASP) are being measured. While serum TxB2 levels of &lt; 2 ng\/ml reflect aspirin-induced inhibition of cyclo-oxygenase-1 activity with high sensitivity, VASP exhibits a wide variability upon treatment with clopidogrel or prasugrel. Multiple studies reveal an association between high residual platelet reactivity and adverse cardiovascular events in patients on antiplatelet therapy. However, despite the plethora of platelet function assays currently under investigation, their use in daily practice cannot be recommended. This is due to several reasons: (i) there is no consensus on the method and a respective cut-off value associated with clinical adverse outcome, and (ii) data demonstrating any benefit of tailored antiplatelet therapy and its monitoring (based on assessment of platelet functions) are still limited. Thus, appropriate identification of 'resistant' or 'poor responders' to antiplatelet agents remains challenging in clinical practice.","599":null,"600":"Vitamin-K-antagonists (VKA) and heparins have been complementary anticoagulants for prevention and treatment of thrombosis for almost 70 years. In contrast to heparins, VKA have not been modified pharmacologically, however treatment surveillance has improved by introducing INR and self-monitoring\/management. Disclosure of the molecular basis of interaction with VKORC1, the target enzyme of VKA, has helped to better understand coumarin sensitivity and resistance. New oral anticoagulants have now been approved and stimulated expectations in patients and physicians to get rid of the burdening frequent controls of VKA without loss of efficacy and safety. This review will summarize the development and profile of the new substances. Main difference compared to VKA is their direct mode of action against one clotting factor which is factor IIa in dabigatran and factor Xa in rivaroxaban and other \"xabanes\" currently under intensive investigation. Half lifes of the new anticoagulants are much shorter than that of the mainly used coumarins (phenprocoumon, warfarin), making \"anticoagulation bridging\" unnecessary before surgery. Therapeutic width of direct thrombin inhibitors and factor Xa inhibitors is broader and they are given at fixed doses. Clinical studies in thromboprophylaxis, thromboembolism and atrial fibrillation indicate at least non-inferiority or even superior efficacy compared with enoxaparin and VKA at comparable safety outcomes. Limitations of the new substances may arise from gastrointestinal side effects, mode of metabolism and route of elimination. Specific antidots are not available for none of them. Undoubtedly, the new oral anticoagulants are very promising. But, although thousands of study patients already have been treated, there are questions to be answered such as treatment adherence in absence of monitoring, safety and efficacy in risk patients, dosage adjustment and interactions with other drugs, before conclusions can be drawn towards their potential to replace VKA.","601":"Trauma-induced coagulopathy (TIC) is a frequent complication of severely injured patients. The etiology of TIC is complex. Contributing factors include overwhelming generation of thrombin and activated protein C, consumption of coagulation factors and platelets, hyperfibrinolysis, and dilution of clotting factors through administration of fluids. In addition, hypothermia and shock-associated metabolic acidosis augment the clotting dysfunctions. The occurrence of TIC has been shown to be an independent risk factor for death after trauma warranting aggressive treatment. On admission to the emergency room patients with massive blood loss should be employed on basis of clinical and diagnostic variables to identify patients at high risk of coagulopathy. Patients at high risk should be treated with tranexamic acid (1 g bolus followed by 1 g\/8 h), and critical factor and platelet deficiencies should be corrected by transfusion of factor concentrates and platelet concentrates. In addition, plasma should be administered in a 1:1 ratio with red cells. The use of recombinant factor VIIa should be considered if major bleeding persists despite best-practive use of blood products.","602":null,"603":"","604":null,"605":null,"606":"","607":"","608":"","609":"Recurrent venous thromboembolism is associated with increased mortality in 5-9% of the patients. On the other hand prolonged anticoagulation can increase the bleeding risk which can also be responsible for an increased mortality. Therefore, it is necessary to validate the recurrence risk of venous thromboembolism on an individual basis. In this review the most relevant risk factors for recurrent venous thromboembolism are analyzed. Spontaneous thrombosis is associated with significantly increased recurrence rates in comparison to risk associated venous thrombosis. In addition, a positive D-dimer result after stop of anticoagulation, an increased amount of residual thrombus in proximal veins analyzed by compression sonography, a proximal localization of thrombosis, symptomatic pulmonary embolism and male sex are clinically relevant risk factors for increased recurrence rates. While mild thrombophilic defects like heterozygous factor V Leiden mutation are not associated with a clinically relevant recurrence risk, inherited inhibitor deficiencies and the antiphospholipid-syndrome are known to be responsible for an increased recurrence rate of venous thromboembolism. A new recurrence risk-score (RR-Score) for individual judgement of patients with a first spontaneous venous thrombosis is introduced.","610":"Inhibiting platelet function is a key therapeutic principle in cardiology because platelets play a pivotal role in triggering cardiovascular events. In addition to acetylsalicylic acid, a cyclooxygenase inhibitor, ADP-receptor blockers are frequently used for anti-platelet therapy. This therapy does not abolish platelet activation and aggregation. Platelets may still be activated by alternative routes such as the thrombin receptor-mediated pathway. New, more potent inhibitors of platelet function continue to lower the risk of ischaemic events but several trials and clinical registries have also shown that this advantage was frequently offset by an increased risk of bleeding complications. As a consequence, the individual risk of ischaemia and bleeding of a patient must be taken into consideration to select the platelet inhibitor offering the best benefit-risk ratio. Modern laboratory diagnostics may help to achieve this goal by complementing functional platelet tests with pharmacogenomic analyses consistent with the idea of \"personalized medicine\".","611":"Overwhelming evidence has linked inflammatory disorders to a hypercoagulable state. In fact, thromboembolic complications are among the leading causes of disability and death in many acute and chronic inflammatory diseases. Despite this clinical knowledge, coagulation and immunity were long regarded as separate entities. Recent studies have unveiled molecular underpinnings of the intimate interconnection between both systems. The studies have clearly shown that distinct pro-inflammatory stimuli also activate the clotting cascade and that coagulation in turn modulates inflammatory signaling pathways. In this review, we use evidence from sepsis and inflammatory bowel diseases as a paradigm for acute and chronic inflammatory states in general and rise hypotheses how a systematic molecular understanding of the \"inflammation-coagulation\" crosstalk may result in novel diagnostic and therapeutic strategies that target the inflammation-induced hypercoagulable state.","612":"Although the utility of platelet function testing is still under debate, the necessity to inhibit platelets in patients suffering from cardiovascular and cerebrovascular disease is undoubted and well proven. The wide variety of available platelet function tests often using different methodologies, the apparent lack of standardization, and finally the emerging evidence on the clinical value of platelet function testing are resulting in a considerable uncertainty in the clinical practice, how to deal with the issue of platelet function testing. Platelet function testing might not only yield clinical benefits for the patients but also economical advantages by identifying the right drug at the right dose for the right patient. This article intends to provide an overview of the current platelet function tests such as light transmittance aggregometry, whole blood impedance aggregometry, the PFA-1001 system, the VerifyNow2 system, flow cytometry, as well as other promising technologies like Plateletworks3, IMPACT-R4, PADA, thromboelastography, and the mean platelet component (MPC), briefly addressing strengths, weaknesses and clinical utility of these tests.","613":null,"614":"An overview is given on the method and the applications of thrombin generation assays. Thrombin generation assays provide a tool which can be used to trace the entire thrombin formation and inactivation of a plasma sample. Therefore they are principally different from traditional global assays like PT and aPTT and promise new opportunities for the assessment of bleeding or thrombotic risks.","615":"Acquired von Willebrand's disease (aVWD) is considered to be an underestimated cause of unexplained bleeding. Adsorption of von Willebrand factor (VWF) to tumour cells or hydroxyethyl starch and elimination of VWF by autoantibodies as well as shear stress-induced mechanical alteration of VWF with concomitant cleavage by enzymes may lead to an acquired deficiency of VWF and a bleeding disorder. We report a 39-year-old woman who developed spontaneous bleeding five years after surgical creation of an arteriovenous fistula (AVF) for haemodialysis treatment. AVWD type 2A was diagnosed after successful renal transplantation. One year after surgical closure of the AVF, the aVWD could not be verified again. Thus, the aVWD may have developed because of altered blood flow and shear stress inside the arteriovenous fistula.","616":null,"617":null,"618":"Oral anticoagulation using vitamin K antagonists has been established for over 50 years. Although it is highly effective in preventing thromboembolic incidents, its therapeutic control still remains problematic. Therefore, a computer-aided approach is recommended for deriving dosages. Up to now, the dosage is often based on the visual inspection of previous INR measurements, average weekly doses, and the INR target range. Statistical variations of measurement results and time-delayed effects of dosages, however, frequently result in the misinterpretation of data and suggest pseudo-trends. Treating physicians are not only responsible for determining the patient-specific maintenance dose, but must also respond to deviating INR values, overdosage or underdosage, initiate the oral anticoagulation therapy, and control the INR level in case of a new target range (bridging). Instructive examples are provided to illustrate the described difficulties. A computer-aided expert system is currently developed to ensure the therapeutic safety under the specified conditions. We present preliminary results from a study designed to validate mathematical models underlying such expert systems.","619":"The aim of the proposed concept is to use anticoagulant therapy in prophylaxis and therapy of thromboembolic events only to an extent that the coagulation activation is just not any longer detectable. It results an individualized anticoagulation tailored to the coagulation activation of the patient (individualized \"minimal invasive\" anticoagulation). Intensity and control of efficiency are to be monitored by measurement of in vivo coagulation activation, e.g. by D-dimer-antigen measurement. Especially with the use of the new oral anticoagulants such a saver anticoagulant therapy - as far as possible from bleeding risk - could open up new indications, which so far are not used because of safety reasons. More patients at risk could be prevented from thromboembolic events. The proposed concept is based on pathophysiological considerations and own clinical experience. It should be evaluated for efficiency in clinical studies.","620":"Myocardial infarction (MI) shows a strong heritability. For a long time the identification of responsible genes has been rather unsuccessful. However, with the advent of genome wide association studies (GWAS) using DNA-array technology a number of significant loci for MI have been identified which were widely replicated. Interestingly, only a small fraction of the hitherto identified genes is also associated with classical risk factors for MI such as hypercholesterolemia or diabetes. Therefore it can be concluded that the MI risk mediated by the newly identified genes involves a number of novel pathophysiological mechanisms. This review summarizes the present state of knowledge in the field and tries to give a perspective on how these findings can be translated into clinical practice and further scientific discovery. Special consideration is given to the association of MI risk with genetic variants in the hemostatic system.","621":"Severity of bleeding phenotype in hemophilia A (HA) depends on the underlying mutation in the F8 gene and, ultimately, on the concentration and functional integrity of the factor VIII (FVIII) protein in circulating plasma. Initial diagnosis for HA and monitoring of treatment is typically performed by measuring of FVIII activity by either one-stage assay or chromogenic assay. We review evidence for why both types of assay do not give comparable results in a significant proportion of patients with non-severe haemophilia A and why the discrepancy in results between both methods segregates with distinct subclasses of known missense mutations causing haemophilia A. The current understanding of the mechanistic basis for how FVIII:C assay discrepancies arise are discussed. We propose that both methods should be used in initial patient diagnosis along with follow-up genetic analysis to avoid potential misdiagnosis and to optimize treatment monitoring of patients with HA phenotypes. ","622":null,"623":"Both for diagnosis of congenital and acquired platelet dysfunction as well as for therapy monitoring after application of platelet function inhibitors various methods have been established for evaluation of platelet function. In contrast to the gold standard of platelet function testing, the light transmission aggregometry in platelet rich plasma the Point-of-care (POC) analyzers allow fast analysis of platelet function without extensive laboratory work up. The conditions of the pre-analytical phase, however, are still of enormous importance in the prevention of medical errors. There is increasing clinical data in monitoring the effect of platelet aggregation inhibitors, showing that quantitative determination of the platelet function degree correlates with risk of increased bleeding or stent thrombosis. However, it is still unclear, which is the optimal test system, to predict the clinical outcome of these patients.","624":"Haemophilia A (HA) is X-chromosome linked bleeding disorders caused by deficiency of the coagulation factor VIII (FVIII). It is caused by FVIII gene intron 22 inversion (Inv22) in approximately 45% and by intron 1 inversion (Inv1) in 5% of the patients. Both inversions occur as a result of intrachromosomal recombination between homologous regions, in intron 1 or 22 and their extragenic copy located telomeric to the FVIII gene. The aim of this study was to analyze the presence of these mutations in 25 HA Costa Rican families. We studied 34 HA patients and 110 unrelated obligate members and possible carriers for the presence of Inv22or Inv1. Standard analyses of the factor VIII gene were used incl. Southern blot and long-range polymerase chain reaction for inversion analysis. We found altered Inv22 restriction profiles in 21 patients and 37 carriers. It was found type 1 and type 2 of the inversion of Inv22. During the screening for Inv1 among the HA patient, who were Inv22 negative, we did not found this mutation. Our data highlight the importance of the analysis of Inv22 for their association with development of inhibitors in the HA patients and we are continuous searching of Inv1 mutation. This knowledge represents a step for genetic counseling and prevention of the inhibitor development.

The RSA equalizes income differences due to the varying levels of contributory income of the members of a health insurance (basic wage totals) and expenditure differences due to varying distribution of morbidity risks across different health insurances, as well as the varying numbers of non-contributing insured family members. Additionally, insured persons are allocated to morbidity groups according to a classification model based upon diagnoses and prescriptions anticipating medical expenses in the subsequent year. Haemophilia falls, among 80 disease entities, in the morbidity group which generates the highest risk supplement. Matching of prescribed drugs with disease entities facilitates disease grading and improves the accuracy of risk supplements.","627":"Haemophilia presents a challenge to every risk adjustment scheme even if it uses diagnostical or pharmaceutical data. The German adjustment scheme developed by the Bundesversicherungsamt realizes fairly cost homogenous groups for many expensive diseases. It does not regard haemophilia. This holds true for the original classification system (grouper) from 2009 and for the improved classification procedure in 2010. The extreme peak costs that can originate from haemophilia cases can present a existential risk for small health plans. The chances to form cost-homogeneous subgroups of the haemophilia disease by more specific coding or other measures seem low because of the small number of cases affected by this disease. The complementary (re-)installation of a expenditure-oriented risk sharing is regarded as suited for improvement of the performance of the German risk adjustment scheme. This also corresponds to international experience and practice.","628":"The upper ankle joint is one of the target-joints of the haemophilic patient. Therefore, the secondary arthritis of the upper ankle joint is one of the most frequent forms of haemophilic arthropathy. It is a secondary form of arthritis not only because of chronic synovitis and cartilage injury resulting from chronic recurrent intraarticular bleeds, but also due to the misalignment of the joint and abnormal joint stress. The consequences are manifest even in young patients and finally lead to upper ankle joint arthritis. In such clinical situations, the upper ankle joint-arthroplasty is a viable alternative to arthrodesis. After several years of bleeding of the upper ankle joint many patients with haemophilia suffer from symptomatic arthritis. Open joint cleansing considerably improves mobility in the upper ankle joint and alleviates the pain in the talonavicular joint. However, the recovered mobility of the arthritic upper ankle joint also activates arthritis, associated with severe pain. With no contraindication to upper ankle joint replacement, a cement-free prosthesis can be implanted. Three months after surgery, the patients are mobile, with good foot rolling properties without orthopaedic aids and without pain in the upper joint ankle. Concludion: In terms of biomechanics the upper ankle joint-arthroplasty is a superior alternative to arthrodesis in haemophilia patients. In order to minimize the complication rate, their treatment should be restricted to specially equipped interdisciplinary centers with adequately trained and experienced surgeons as well as haemostaseologists.","629":"Increasing evidence indicates that thrombin plays a role not only in thrombosis but also in the progression of atherosclerosis. The relationship between thrombin generation and intima-media thickness (IMT) as an index of subclinical atherosclerosis was investigated. Participants, material, methods: We examined 163 asymptomatic middle-aged persons free of overt clinical atherosclerotic disease. They underwent ultrasonography of the common carotid arteries. In addition, thrombin generation was measured by means of CAT (calibrated automated thrombography). For our study we divided the healthy study participants into three age groups (&lt;45, 45-60 and &gt;60 years). A significant positive correlation was seen between endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) (p = 0.012), time to peak (TTP) (p = 0.033) start tail (p = 0.007) and carotid IMT in the group of healthy volunteers younger than 45 years. We demonstrated that in adults younger than 45 years without clinically overt atherosclerotic disease ETP was significantly associated with carotid IMT. It is tempting to speculate that ETP may serve as an index for subclinical atherosclerosis in persons below 45 years.

The patient was diagnosed with acquired factor VIII deficiency (FVIII activity 1.2%, FVIII inhibitor 31.7 BU). Due to the active bleeding diathesis, treatment was administered with activated prothrombin complex concentrates (FEIBA&amp;reg;, Baxter). Immunosuppressive treatment with a combination of oral prednisone (1 mg\/kg daily) and cyclophosphamide (1,5 mg\/kg daily) was administered to reduce the FVIII inhibitor. However, after two weeks of treatment, FVIII was only 3% and no clinical improvement was observed. Treatment with the anti CD20 monoclonal antibody rituximab intravenously at 375 mg\/m2 once weekly for four consecutive weeks was started. The patient showed rapid clinical improvement following rituximab treatment. He achieved a complete remission defined as return to normal FVIII activity and undetectable FVIII inhibitor titer.

At the age of six month a severe cerebral haemorrhage occurred, making a high-dose pdFVIII substitution and neurosurgical intervention necessary. Several days later a porth-a-cath-system was implanted. The development of a high titer inhibitor occured six days later, an ITI was started according to the Bonn Protocol. Initially rFVIIa was given in addition to the pdFVIII substitution. Seven days after the beginning of treatment the inhibitor was no longer detectable. At monthly intervals the FVIII dosage was reduced until the dosage complied with a prophylaxis in severe haemophilia A. The duration of the ITI was nine months.

All patients with severe HA and HB treated at the haemophilia care center were included. We evaluated the regimen of replacement therapy and factor concentrate consumption within the last 5 years (1\/2004 to 12\/2008). Intracerebral bleeds were analysed over the whole life span of the included patients. 111\/181 patients with HA had the severe form and 12\/34 patients severe HB. 4\/12 patients with severe HB had a history of intracerebral bleeding in comparison to 5\/111 patients with severe HA. 2\/8 adult patients with severe HB used a prophylactic treatment with factor concentrates (mean consumption 1289 IU factor IX\/kg BW\/year) in contrast to 60\/95 adult patients with HA (mean consumption 2109 IU factor VIII \/kg BW\/year).

","641":"Haemophilia is the most frequent hereditary haemorrhagic illness and it is due to the deficiency of coagulation factors VIII (haemophilia A, HA) or IX (haemophilia B, HB). The prevalence of this disease varies according to the country, those having better survival rates having also higher prevalences. Specifically in Costa Rica, there are around 130 HA and 30 HB families. This study reports the prevalence and a spatial distribution analysis of both types of the disease in this country. The prevalence of haemophilia in this country is 7 cases per 100000 men, for HA it is 6 cases per 100000 and for HB it is 1 case per 100000 male inhabitants. The prevalence of this disease is low when compared with other populations. This low prevalence could be due to the many patients that have died because of infection with human immunodeficiency virus during the 1980s. The prevalence of haemophilia in Costa Rica is almost one half of that present in developed countries. Nevertheless, the ratio between HA and HB follows world tendency: 5:1. In this study, nationwide geographical distribution maps were drawn in order to visualize the origin of severe cases and how this influences the pattern of distribution for both types of haemophilia. By means of these maps, it was possible to state that there is no association between the sites of maximum prevalence of mutated alleles and ethnicity. With this study, haemophilia prevalence distribution maps can be used to improve efforts for the establishment of hemophilia clinics or specialized health centers in those areas which hold the highest prevalences in this country. Also, this knowledge can be applied to improve treatment skills and offer the possibility of developing focused genetic counseling for these populations.","642":null,"643":"With the development of clotting-factors in the seventies the haemophilia patients were released from being handicapped and began to live a quite normal life. Thus, psychosocial counselling did not seem to be necessary. But the impact of HIV-infection to the world of haemophilia was so intense that professional help was offered at the Munich Hemophilia Centre since 1985. During the preceeding 25 years we talked to about 120 patients and relatives every year in more than 10000 psychotherapeutic talks. 70 of our patients were HIV-infected. For about half of them we took care until they died on AIDS or of liver-disease. The other 50 patients (HIV-negative) were also distressed enormously. At the beginning the highlights in counselling were e. g. fear of manifestation of AIDS, dying and death, social stigma. Around 1993 with the decoding of HCV and the first useful HIV therapies the topics in counselling changed: New HIV-medical-treatment, menacing by HCV, wish for own children due to improved HIV medical care etc. Our experiences have shown that self esteem and social integration of haemophilia patients have reached again normality.

The flow cytometric measurements revealed an increased microparticle concentration in newborn cord compared with adult plasma. By the use of ELISA a significantly increased procoagulant activity of microparticles was found in newborn cord plasma as compared to adult plasma. Initiation of thrombin generation by adding phospholipids alone resulted in a significant lower prolongation of the lag time, time to peak in cord plasma, while the decrease of endogenous thrombin potential (ETP) and peak was comparable between newborns and adults. Our results show a higher impact of microparticles on the haemostatic system of newborns than on that of adults. The three methods suggest a somewhat increased microparticle activity in newborn cord plasma, but argue against strong platelet activation during birth. ","645":"Rehabilitation and physical therapy in the sense of functional health is based on the international classification of function. It takes in two considerations: function and structure of the body and their influence on personal and social activity. The integrative concept of joint function translates the basic concept of body function and structure on to the motion of the locomotive system. Stability needs motoric control. Motoric control and the integrated neural components are to be influenced through regulation of muscle tonus (massage, manual therapy, medical training therapy, electrotherapy and thermotherapy). The stability of the joint is controlled by the passive components. Passive structures are optimised through passive therapies like joint mobilisation. Active components of joint function are optimised through activation (medical training therapy, stabilisation, mono or multisegmental levels). Emotional and neuronal components can be triggered through kinesthetic exercises like PNF, Jacobsen relaxation, biofeedback training, mental training. Exact examination of the locomotive system will help finding all symptoms. This is how we individualise the therapy of symptoms and structures. The motion pattern generator shows us how to use the possibilities of functional influence on the motion pattern. We have a lot of afferent signals that need individualised functional therapy. This is why we need functional measurements like motion analysis on the basis of ultrasound. An other tool is the kinetic superficial EMG measurement of muscle function. We can use it to determine the status of the joint and it will lead to therapeutical decisions. All functional measurements will help to improve quality control of the physical therapy process. Even if the haemophilic patient is healthy he is not fit at all. Measurements of fitness will help us to improve special skills and establish the human being as a subject in society and environment.

Here we report on a boy with severe haemophilia A and intron 22 inversion of the FVIII gene who was diagnosed at ten months of age. After 16 exposure days to FVIII (81 days after initial exposure) he developed a FVIII inhibitor (maximum: 9.76 BU\/ml). We started immune tolerance induction (ITI) according to the Bonn protocol with high dose plasma derived FVIII concentrate (100 IU per kg body weight) twice daily. For additional inhibitor elimination treatment the patient received intravenous immunoglobulin (ivIg) at a dose of 1-2 g\/kg body weight every 4 to 6 weeks. After start of treatment a rapid decline of the inhibitor level was observed, nevertheless low FVIII inhibitor levels persisted (&lt;5 BU\/ml). Furthermore, the FVIII half-life was still accelerated. However, after every course of ivIg the inhibitor level declined and FVIII half-life was prolonged. Currently, the FVIII half-life is approaching normal values after more than seven months of ITI duration. Additional application of immunoglobulin is beneficial for immune tolerance induction. ","649":"The Swiss Haemophilia Registry of the Medical Committee of the Swiss Haemophilia Society started in 1996 but was set as an internet-based, double password-protected facility in the year 2000. With the inclusion of patients' data from two new centres in 2009, we assume a coverage rate of about 90% of all patients with inherited bleeding disorders in our country. Data concerning the phenotype and genotype of the disorder, its severity, its therapy, the prevalence of inhibitors are readily available to the registered users, allowing quality control of haemophilia therapy at a national level, but also rapid care of the patient visiting the emergency room of another treatment centre. Basing on the available data, about two thirds of the WFH global survey can be answered; the mortality statistics shows that bleeding remains a cause of death in haemophiliacs, also in the 21th century. The Registry allows for comparisons with international datasets, especially with respect to treatment (prophylaxis vs. on-demand therapy), factor consumption and costs.","650":"In particular health economists promise to improve healthcare processes, cost-effectiveness and outcomes by standardised procedures. In the area of EOS indication, operative procedures and postal-surgical pain therapy can partly be standardised. In addition, clinical pathways have impact on the organisation of care if the care process is structured in a standardised way. On these four subjects examples are demonstrated. Elective orthopaedic surgery in haemophilia can be standardised. Nevertheless, it may not be forgotten that these patients can be categorised only restrictedly and the individual, interdisciplinary treatment must be prior to clinical standards.","651":"It is very difficult to determine if patients with a moderate low level of VWF parameters have mild disease or if they are just low normal (so called grey area of VWD). This applies particularly to pediatrics, because it is difficult to evaluate the bleeding history of children. Al our centres every child diagnosed with vWD gets DDAVP to test the response for it. This study was done to evaluate the DDAVP- test as a diagnostic tool. A retrospective analysis of data obtained with routine DDAVP administration for test purposes in 52 patients with borderline von Willebrand disease at the haemophilia centre Graz was done. The increase of VWF:Ag, VWF:RiCof and FVIII:C has been document and compared. All of our patients had a very good response after application of DDAVP. The increase of VWF:Ag, VWF:RiCof and FVIII:C was compared in patients with positive and negative bleeding anamneses. The patients with positive anamneses had significantly lower parameters at the beginning. The increase of VWF parameters did not differ significantly between the groups at the different time-points. These results demonstrate that a positive anamnesis is not significantly associated with a lower increase. On the other side a high increase is not associated with a negative anamnesis. It is not possible to use the DDAVP test as a diagnostic tool for patients within the diagnostic grey area of VWD. ","652":"Since 1978 an annual multicentric survey regarding the epidemiology of patients suffering of haemophilia is performed with support of hemophilia treating centres of any size. Again the actual compilation is resting upon a broad database returning to over 30 years of inquiry well representing both the actual and retrospective status of mortality. Prompted was exclusively information about patients with haemophilia A, B and von Willebrand disease. In particular anonymous data concerning the last 12 months about number of treated patients, type and severity of illness, HIV-status and detailed information about causes of death was inquired. This data was merged with existing data and analyzed statistically. In the 2008\/2009 survey, a total number of 9101 patients with bleeding disorders have been reported from 66 participating centres. Despite mortality from HIV in patients with haemophilia is keeping on decreasing, HIV still remains an important factor as an HIV\/HCV coinfection seems to increase risk of progression of severe liver disease. Age structure in our patients has been shifting significantly over the last decades bringing age distribution into line with the entire population. This has to be considered assessing mortality and morbidity.","653":null,"654":"","655":"The antiphospholipid syndrome (APS) is a non-inflammatory autoimmune disease characterized by the presence of antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) in the plasma of patients with vascular thrombosis, recurrent complications of pregnancy, or both (1, 2). The presence of aPL in plasma of patients can be detected with either a prolongation of phospholipid dependent coagulation tests (lupus anticoagulant, LAC), or with solid phase immune assays against the protein beta2-glycoprotein I (beta2-GPI) or the phospholipid cardiolipin (anti-beta2-GPI antibody ELISA and anti-cardiolipin antibody ELISA, respectively) (3). For a long time there was a lot of confusion on who had the syndrome and who not. To solve this dispute, an international consensus meeting was organized in Sapporo in 1999 to formulate classification criteria for patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome (4). These criteria have been updated in 2004 at another international consensus meeting in Sydney (5). The classification criteria were defined for scientific purposes and were aimed to be used as inclusion criteria in patient related studies. They were specifically not defined for diagnostic purposes. However, current practice is that these criteria are used as a diagnostic tool. This is very unfortunate because the specificity of the different aPL assays to detect the clinical manifestations that characterize APS are disputable. One of the aims of defining the criteria was to initiate studies to determine the value of the different anti-phospholipid antibody assays to serve as biomarker for the risk of thrombosis and pregnancy morbidity. The recent progress made on this important topic will be discussed.","656":null,"657":"Full-length tissue factor (flTF) initiates coagulation, but also exerts non-hemostatic functions such as inflammation and angiogenesis through protease activated receptors (PARs). In 2003 a soluble variant of flTF was described which results from alternative splicing. Since its discovery the role of alternatively spliced tissue factor (asTF) in coagulation has been debated. asTF may have pro-coagulant properties but due to structural differences when compared to flTF, asTF coagulant function may be relatively low. Nevertheless, similar to flTF, asTF appears to have non-hemostatic properties; asTF expression in tumors correlates with increased tumor size, vessel number and poor survival in some cancer types, and drives tumor growth in animal models. Interestingly, unlike flTF, asTF does not promote angiogenesis through activating PARs but rather via integrin ligation. flTF is a critical determinant in cardiovascular disease but little is known about asTF in cardiovascular disease. asTF is produced by monocytes and macrophages, thus macrophage-derived asTF may contribute to atherosclerotic disease. In conclusion, unraveling asTF's non-hemostatic properties may generate new insights in the pathophysiology and diagnostics of cancer and cardiovascular disease.","658":"Platelet and coagulation factor-dependent thrombus formation is critical to limit posttraumatic blood loss at sites of vascular injury. However, under pathological conditions like rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque, it may also lead to vessel occlusion causing myocardial infarction or stroke. Therefore, antithrombotic treatment is the prime therapeutic option in the prophylaxis and treatment of ischaemic cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases. The use of existing antithrombotic agents is, however, limited by their inherent effect on primary haemostasis. In recent years, major advances have been made in understanding the mechanisms of thrombus formation in haemostasis and thrombosis and some studies raised the interesting possibility that occlusive thrombus formation and haemostasis may involve partially different mechanisms. This review briefly summarizes these developments and highlights newly identified mechanisms involved in platelet adhesion and activation, intracellular calcium signaling, integrin activation and initiation of coagulation. The suitability of these pathways as novel targets for antithrombotic therapy is discussed.","659":"Von Willebrand factor (VWF) is a pivotal haemostatic protein mediating platelet adhesion to injured endothelium and carrying coagulation factor VIII (FVIII) in the circulation to protect it from premature clearance. Apart from the roles in haemostasis, VWF drives the formation of the endothelial cell specific Weibel-Palade bodies (WPBs), which serve as a regulated storage of VWF and other thrombotic and inflammatory factors. Defects in VWF could lead to the bleeding disorder von Willebrand disease (VWD). Extensive studies have shown that several mutations identified in VWD patients cause an intracellular retention of VWF. However, the effects of such mutations on the formation and function of its storage organelle are largely unknown. This review gives an overview on the role of VWF in WPB biogenesis and summarizes the limited data on the WPBs formed by VWD-causing mutant VWF.","660":"Ischaemic stroke is a devastating disease with limited treatment options due to numerous uncertainties regarding the underlying pathophysiology. The contribution of glycoprotein (GP)Ibalpha and von Willebrand factor (VWF) in stroke development has only recently been established in mice. Complete blockade of GPIbalpha led to a significant reduction of infarct volumes in mice undergoing one hour of transient middle cerebral artery occlusion (tMCAO). High shear-induced changes in VWF confirmation are a prerequisite for VWF binding to collagen and GPIbalpha expressed on platelets. Importantly, transgenic VWF-\/- mice were similarly protected against ischemic stroke after tMCAO, and hydrodynamic injection of a VWF-encoding plasmid restored VWF serum levels and the susceptibility towards stroke. Secreted VWF is rapidly cleaved by ADAMTS13. Accordingly, ADAMTS13 deficient mice developed larger infarction after tMCAO, while infusion of recombinant ADAMTS13 into wild-type mice was stroke-protective. In conclusion, there is compelling evidence that GPIbalpha\/VWF interactions and downstream signaling via phospholipase D1 (PLD1) provide new therapeutic targets in ischemic stroke.","661":"A 17-year old man was sent to us for coagulation testing because he suffered from acute bleeding which started immediately after making an incision in the skin for a urological surgery. The patient had a history of mild bleeding symptoms (nose bleeds during the childhood, gingival bleeds). Results of laboratory investigations: Blood group 0, closure times (PFA 100):132 s (ADP\/collagen) and 300 s (epinephrine\/collagen), VWF antigen 57%, VWF activity 50%, factor VIII activity 66%, factor XIII activity 59%. The results were confirmed by further investigations. Additionally, two relevant genetic findings were obtained: first a heterozygous base exchange in exon 11 of the factor 13A gene -Thr 449 (ACT)&gt;Ile (ATT)-, not described before the completion of the study, and second the homozygous state of the 807 C-allele within the integrin alpha2 gene. The patient inherited the base exchange in the factor 13A gene from his mother. Homozygosity of the 807 C allele in the integrin alpha2 gene is associated with a very low expression of the platelet collagen receptor. Individuals with low VWF due to blood group 0 and low platelet collagen receptor density often exhibit a bleeding tendency, e.g. bleedings from mucosal membranes or menorrhagia in females. In our opinion the light factor XIII deficiency in our patient is coincidental and not the sole cause of bleeding. ","662":"Thromboelastography\/thromboelastometry (TEG\/ROTEM) is widely used in near-patient setting, especially in perioperative and intensive care medicine for the management of acute bleeding. Until now a comprehensive quality management especially an external quality control of TEG\/ROTEM results is not established. Here we report about our results of a pilot survey performed in 2008 and 2009 integrated in the External Quality Assessment Schemes (EQAS) performed by INSTAND. According to this first EQAS data ROTEM results can be controlled in external quality schemes using lyophilized plasma samples. The clot firmness (A20) and clot formation kinetics characterized by the alpha-angle showed very good reproducibility both between the participants and between different surveys. Variations for CT and CFT were considerably higher especially in the plasma sample with reduced fibrinogen level. Regular participation in an external quality assurance will help to confirm this beneficial technology in emergency settings.","663":"During the 20th century understanding for quality has changed and international and national requirements for quality have been published. Therefore also medical branches started to establish quality management systems. Quality assurance has always been important for medical laboratories. Certification according to the standard ISO 9001 and accreditation according to the standard ISO 17025 have been the proof of fulfilling quality requirements. The relatively new standard ISO 15189 is the first standard for medical laboratories. This standard includes technical and management requirements for the medical laboratory. The main focus is the proof of competence within the personnel. As this standard is accepted throughout the European Union an increase in accreditations of medical laboratories is predictable.","664":"In the last years several point of care testing (POCT) systems used for coagulation parameters have been developed and became daily routine. As for other POCT applications (e. g. blood gas analysis) there is a need for user education and continuous improvement of quality assurance. For some POCT coagulation systems a comprehensive quality management has not been established yet. According to the feasibility and availability of control material and system self control each POCT coagulation method described in this article has a varying concept of quality management. Besides a high quality standard in manufacturing systems, devices and reagents the education of the user and the automatic self control of the instrument as well as the application of electronic and\/ or liquid control samples contribute to the total quality assurance. Even if a \"like versus like\" control material is not available a comprehensive quality management should be implemented in daily routine concerning pre-analytic as well as technical and post-analytic criteria. Anyway to do nothing as the available control material seems to be not suitable is a bad decision.","665":"Due to their complex preanalytics coagulation tests show a higher rate of rejected samples due to insufficient quality and a higher intra- and inter-individual test variability. In the last years several guidelines addressed this issue in an effort to standardize preanalytic procedures. However, in daily laboratory work, these guidelines frequently cannot be fully executed, due to technical limitations or sample transport logistics. In this manuscript several important issues in sample collection, handling and transportation will be discussed. Since the stability and variability of routine coagulation tests such as prothrombin time and partial prothrombin time are significantly influenced by a number of variables such as tube type, manufacturer, reagents used and analyzer systems, it is recommended that each laboratory develops its own manuals for sample collection, based on published data and internal evaluations.","666":"Several challenges arise from the wide application of molecular genetic analyses, among them the need to introduce rules to evaluate molecular genetic test systems as well as test laboratories. This article specifically addresses laboratories performing molecular genetic tests for diagnosis, prevention and therapy of various diseases. The topics that will be discussed will support these laboratories to achieve and sustain a high quality and avoid mistakes and errors. The article covers important preanalytic, analytic and postanalytic aspects in regard to molecular genetic testing as well as quality management issues. In addition laboratory responsibilities, training of personnel, data protection issues, as well as informed consent aspects will be discussed. Beyond that, some molecular genetic methods will be dealt with in regard to potential quality criteria.","667":"Platelet number or function disorders cause a range of bleeding symptoms from mild to severe. Patients with platelet dysfunction but normal platelet number are the most prevalent and typically have mild bleeding symptoms. The study of this group of patients is particularly difficult because of the lack of a gold-standard test of platelet function and the variable penetrance of the bleeding phenotype among affected individuals. The purpose of this short review is to discuss the way in which this group of patients can be investigated through platelet phenotyping in combination with targeted gene sequencing. This approach has been used recently to identify patients with mutations in key platelet activation receptors, namely those for ADP, collagen and thromboxane A2 (TxA2). One interesting finding from this work is that for some patients, mild bleeding is associated with heterozygous mutations in platelet proteins that are co-inherited with other genetic disorders of haemostasis such as type 1 von Willebrand's disease. Thus, the phenotype of mild bleeding may be multifactorial in some patients and may be considered to be a complex trait.","668":"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT), typically occurring in the second week of heparin therapy, is an antibody-mediated adverse drug reaction associated with increased thrombotic risk. The most important antigens are located on platelet factor 4 (PF4)\/heparin complexes. HIT is always caused by platelet-activating antibodies, but not all PF4\/heparin-reactive antibodies cause HIT. Thus, tests have a high negative, but only a moderate, positive predictive value. Clinical suspicion of HIT requires cessation of heparin and substitution with an alternative anticoagulant. As these drugs have an increased bleeding risk, they should be used in therapeutic doses only if HIT is considered very likely. Avoiding\/postponing coumarin is crucial in minimizing microthrombotic complications. Recent studies of HIT immunobiology suggest that HIT mimics immunity against repetitive antigens, as are relevant in microbial defense. Thus, understanding HIT may help unravel why host defenses can trigger autoimmunity.","669":"Inflammation drives arterial, venous and microvascular thrombosis. Chronic inflammation contributes to arterial thrombotic complications, whereas acute inflammation drives venous thrombosis and microvascular thrombosis. Mechanistically, inflammation modulates thrombotic responses by upregulating procoagulants, downregulating anticoagulants and suppressing fibrinolysis. The inflammatory response can also result in cell apoptosis or necrosis. Products released from the dead cells, particularly histones, propagate further inflammation, tissue death and organ failure. Inhibition of histone mediated cytotoxicity appears to be a new mechanism for protecting against this deadly cascade.","670":"Critically ill patients often have systemic activation of both inflammation and coagulation. Increasing evidence points to an extensive cross-talk between these two systems, whereby inflammation not only leads to activation of coagulation, but coagulation also considerably affects inflammatory activity. The intricate relationship between inflammation and coagulation may have major consequences for the pathogenesis of microvascular failure and subsequent multiple organ failure, as a result of severe infection and the associated systemic inflammatory response. Molecular pathways that contribute to inflammation-induced activation of coagulation have been precisely identified. Activation of the coagulation system and ensuing thrombin generation is dependent on an interleukin-6-induced expression of tissue factor on activated mononuclear cells and endothelial cells and is insufficiently counteracted by tissue factor pathway inhibitor. Simultaneously, endothelial-bound anticoagulant mechanisms, in particular the protein C system and the antithrombin system, are shut-off by pro-inflammatory cytokines. Modulation of inflammatory activity by activation of coagulation also occurs by various mechanisms. Activated coagulation proteases, such as the tissue factor-factor VIIa complex, factor Xa and thrombin can bind to protease-activated receptors on various cells and the ensuing intracellular signaling leads to increased production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and chemokines. Physiological anticoagulants can modulate inflammatory activity as well. Increasing knowledge on the various mechanisms underlying activation of inflammation and coagulation may lead to better (adjunctive) management strategies in critically ill patients.","671":"","672":"The Swiss Haemophilia Registry of the Medical Committee of the Swiss Haemophilia Society was established in 2000. Primarily it bears epidemiological and basic clinical data (incidence, type and severity of the disease, age groups, centres, mortality). Two thirds of the questions of the WFH Global Survey can be answered, especially those concerning use of concentrates (global, per capita) and treatment modalities (on-demand versus prophylactic regimens). Moreover, the registry is an important tool for quality control of the haemophilia treatment centres. There are no informations about infectious diseases like hepatitis or HIV, due to non-anonymisation of the data. We plan to incorporate the results of the mutation analysis in the future.","673":"Haemophilic arthropathy is often present in patients with severe haemophilia. New studies demonstrate that only a small amount and a short exposure of blood in vitro are able to induce an impairment of the joint cartilage. Free blood in the joint leads to different mechanisms and includes cartilage and bone damage induced by a release of macrophages and monocytes followed by activated cytokines and inflammatory processes. Another mechanism is mediated by free iron resulting in synovitis and synovial hyperplasia and a neoangiogenesis on the base of VEGF release is common. At worst, these processes result in a complete picture of haemophilic arthropathy reducing quality of life. Few studies are available about the influence of factor treatment regime, e. g. prophylaxis or on-demand therapy, on the development of haemophilic arthropathy. However these studies investigated in most cases children. Therefore, it is still impossible to give recommendations for the right treatment in adult haemophilic patients because data are still lacking. For that reason, we attempt to initiate the HemArthro-Project to investigate the influence of treatment therapy on the development of arthropathy in adult haemophilic patients. This study includes the investigation of functional musculoskeletal parameters for the description of joint function in maximal 500 severe haemophilic patients parted into two groups of treatment regime (prophylaxis vs. on-demand). The investigators are seeking further assistance from the haemophilic treatment centers for the support of this study.","674":"In children, screening for haemorrhagic disorders is further complicated by the fact that infants and young children with mild disease in many cases most likely will not have a significant history of easy bruising or bleeding making the efficacy of a questionnaire even more questionable. We compared the questionnaires of a group of 88 children in whom a haemorrhagic disorder was ruled out by rigorous laboratory investigation to a group of 38 children with mild von Willebrand disease (VWD). Questionnaires about child, mother and father were obtained prior to the laboratory diagnosis on the occasion of routine preoperative screening. 23\/38 children with mild VWD showed at least one positive question in the questionnaire, while 21\/88 without laboratory signs showed at least one positive question. There was a trend to more specific symptoms in older children. Three or more positive questions were found only in VWD patients, but only in a few of the control group. The question about menstrual bleeding in mothers did not differ significantly. Sensitivity of the questionnaire for a hemostatic disorder was 0.60, while specifity was 0.76. The negative predictive value was 0.82, but the positive predictive value was only 0.52. Our small study shows, that a questionnaire yields good results to exclude a haemostatic disorder, but is not a sensitive tool to identify such a disorder. ","675":"Newborns have, despite low clotting factors and poor in vitro platelet function, a well functioning hemostasis. The reason for this is still not completely clear. The aim of our study was to investigate whether phospholipids in neonatal platelets differ from those in adult platelets in their total amount, in their exposure on the platelet surface, and their effect on thrombin generation (TG). Clotting times of newborn and adult platelet-rich plasma were measured. Effect of newborn and adult platelets on TG was measured by means of CAT (calibrated automated thrombography). In addition, the effect of newborn and adult platelets with or without stimulation by ionophor on TG was measured in a purified prothrombinase complex. Phosphatidylserine-exposure (PS) of newborn and adult platelets was measured by flow cytometry of annexin V binding. The amount of phospholipids (PL) was determined by means of mass spectrometry. Clotting times of platelet-rich plasma (PRP) of newborns stimulated with ionophor showed a significant lower reduction of clotting time than in adult PRP. No differences in the support of TG between neonatal and adult platelets were found in neonatal or adult plasma by means of CAT. In the purified system TG was increased by adding ionophor stimulated platelets but no difference was evident between stimulated newborn and adult platelets. Flow cytometric analysis showed no difference in annexin V binding between adult and newborn platelets. The results of mass spectrometry showed a very similar amount and pattern of PL of adult and newborns platelets. Our results do not provide any evidence that a different PL content or expression of neonatal platelets may alter TG in neonates. ","676":"In adults, inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is associated with an increased risk of thromboembolic complications. The pathogenesis of IBD is not really clear and a high thrombin activity might contribute to disease progression. We wanted to see whether children with IBD have a higher thrombin generation (TG). Plasma samples were collected of 20 patients with IBD and of 60 healthy controls (age range from 10 to 19). TG was measured by means of Calibrated automated thrombography (CAT). The disease activity was estimated, using the Pediatric Crohn's Disease Activity Index (PCDAI) for Crohn's disease and the Pediatric Ulcerative Colitis Disease Activity Index (PUCAI) for Ulcerative Colitis. In addition, we investigated F1+F2, TAT, TFPI and fibrinogen. There was a significant increase of endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), lag time and time to peak in patients with IBD, while peak showed no difference to healthy controls. ETP and F1+F2 in children with IBD also showed a significant correlation with PCDAI (PUCAI) and fibrinogen. IBD in children is associated with high TG, but this seems to be caused mainly by the inflammatory process and not by any individual disposition. ","677":"Recurrent bleeding into joints represents the clinical hallmark of haemophilia and, if not adequately treated, it may cause chronic synovitis and degenerative arthropathy. The first treatment option of recurrent haemarthroses and\/or chronic synovitis is represented by synoviorthesis, both chemical and radioisotopic, with a success rate of approximately 80% for both. However, radioisotopic synoviorthesis should be preferred because it makes it possible to obtain complete synovial fibrosis usually in one session, without the need for repeated injections, thus reducing the risk of bleeding complications and concentrate consumption. For all these reasons this procedure should be implemented and supported, particularly in developing countries.","678":"Baxter has developed a recombinant therapy for treating von Willebrand's disease. Recombinant VWF is co-expressed with the rFVIII in CHO cells used to produce the rFVIII product Advate. This rVWF is used as a drug component for a rVWF-rFVIII complex drug product. CHO cells produce partially processed and partially un-processed rVWF still containing the pro-peptide. In order to make a consistent preparation containing mature and processed rVWF only rVWF is exposed to recombinant furin to remove the pro-peptide. Recombinant VWF and furin are produced under serum- and protein-free conditions. It is highly purified by a series of chromatographic steps and formulated in a protein-free buffer and has a homogeneous multimer distribution. The specific activity is higher in rVWF than in commercial plasma-derived VWF-FVIII complex products. SDS agarose electrophoretic analysis shows the presence of ultra-high molecular weight multimers. The FVIII-binding capacity and affinity of rVWF to FVIII is comparable to VWF in plasma. Carbohydrate analysis shows an intact glycosylation pattern. Recombinant VWF binds to collagen and promotes platelet adhesion under shear stress. It stabilizes endogenous FVIII in VWF-deficient knock-out mice as seen by a secondary rise in murine FVIII.","679":"Treatment of elderly patients with haemophilia is an upcoming challenge in haemophilia care. We included patients with haemophilia A older than 60 years of age, who visited our haemophilia centre between 2006 and 2008. We conducted a retrospective study focussing on the patients' co-morbidities as well as changes in their bleeding patterns between 2003 and 2008. There is a tendency of increasing bleeding symptoms with increasing age of the patients due to more frequent spontaneous joint bleedings, malignancies or treatment with phenprocoumon or ASS. In consequence, FVIII dosage had to be increased for 8 patients (28%). Chronic hepatitis C, coronary heart disease and malignancies are the most frequent co-morbidities. ","680":"Since 1978 an annual multicentric survey regarding the epidemiology of patients suffering of haemophilia is performed with support of haemophilia treating centres of any size. Again the actual compilation is resting upon a broad database returning to over 30 years of inquiry well representing both the actual and retrospective status of mortality. Prompted was exclusively information about patients with haemophilia A, B and von Willebrand disease. In particular anonymous data concerning the last 12 months about number of treated patients, type and severity of illness, HIV-status and detailed information about causes of death was inquired. This data was merged with existing data and analyzed statistically. In the 2007\/2008 survey, a total number of 8904 patients with bleeding disorders have been reported from 63 participating centres. Despite mortality from HIV in patients with haemophilia is keeping on decreasing, HIV still remains an important factor as an HIV\/HCV coinfection seems to increase risk of progression of severe liver disease. Age structure in our patients has been shifting significantly over the last decades bringing age distribution into line with the entire population. This has to be considered assessing mortality and morbidity.","681":"The treatment of haemophilia requires continuous development of knowledge related to various aspects of diagnosis and therapy. It is, therefore, essential to collect valid and representative data, which are comparable on an international level. The Austrian Haemophilia Registry was set up by the Scientific Advisory Panel of the Austrian Haemophilia Society and by the patient organisation. For the design, it was decided to divide the registry into three sections, two concerning quality control and a third concerning scientific questions, the latter requiring written informed consent. A web-based software is used to collect data. Transfer and storage of data are secured and the server is situated in a computer center with video and access control. Data entry was initiated early 2008. Currently, only preliminary data are available. Our further focus is on continued data entry, which will further enable us to provide information concerning the characteristics of the haemophilia patient population in Austria and the actual treatment modalities used.","682":"The influence of desmopressin on hemostasis is mediated by the release of von Willebrand factor and of coagulation factor VIII from vascular endothelium. The necessity of testing desmopressin effectiveness on hemostasis is a matter of controversy and the performance of the test is not yet standardized. For this reason the desmopressin tests in 114 children with von Willebrand syndrome (type 1, n=98; type 2A, n=12; type 2M, n=2; type 2N, n=2) carried out in 7 paediatric haemostaseologic centers were retrospectively analyzed. The effectiveness of desmopressin was assessed using defined response criteria. As expected, the test performance showed a wide variation among the centers. In 99 children desmopressin was given intravenously as a short infusion at a dosage ranging from 0.25 to 0.41 microg\/kg and in 15 intranasally at an absolute dose of 40 to 300 microg. The points of time for blood taking after desmopressin application ranged from 0.5 to 12 h. The absent desmopressin response in 7 patients (6%) and the partial response in 15 indicate the necessity of testing desmopressin effectiveness before the first therapeutic use. The application of desmopressin was well tolerated by the patients.","683":"Pseudo tumours are amongst the rare yet pathognomonic complications of haemophilia. They are old, encapsulated haematomas which due to their sometimes enormous size can cause massive complaints. These haematomas are surrounded by a thick fibrous capsule. They are attributed to persistent bleedings. The pathophysiology of pseudo tumors is not conclusively established yet. Some believe that they originate from bone material or the periosteum, while others suggest their development from soft tissue. They spread aggressively, displace the surrounding tissue, and cause secondary periosteal erosion of the bone. This results in bone resorption and destruction of surrounding muscular and soft tissue. Pseudo tumours develop slowly over many years. They occur primarily in adults and are largely unresponsive to conservative treatment. A 48-year-old man with moderate hemophiliaA (FVIII:C 2%) and no FVIII inhibitor. Due to recurrent bleeding into the muscle of the right thigh diagnosis of two pseudo tumours (psoas, adductor magnus). In 2004 tumour extirpation with subsequent relapse; because of high local bleeding tendency (despite permanent prophylaxis with FVIII concentrate and adjusted lifestyle) surgical revision in 02\/2008. Postoperatively, no recurrent bleeding; the patient is fully fit for work three months later. In order to reduce the complication rate when a pseudo tumor is suspected, patients should be treated in a specially equipped interdisciplinary center with adequately trained and experienced surgeons and haemostaseologists. ","684":"Secondary arthrosis of the upper ankle joint (talocalcanean joint) is one of the most frequent forms of haemophilic arthropathy. It is a secondary form of arthrosis not only because of chronic synovitis and cartilage injury resulting from chronic recurrent intraarticular bleeds, but also due to the misalignment of the joint and abnormal joint stress. The consequences are manifest even in young patients and finally lead to subtalar joint ankylosis with the biomechanical disorder of foot drop (talipes equinus). In such clinical situations, implantation of a subtalar joint endoprosthesis is a viable alternative to arthrodesis. A man (age: 52 years), suffering from severe haemophilia A (residual FVIII activity &lt; 1 %), no inhibitor formation. The patient has a history of several years of painful ankylosis of the right ankle joint and minor talipes equinus, and suffers from symptomatic talonavicular arthrosis. Open joint cleansing considerably improved mobility in the upper ankle joint and alleviated the pain in the talonavicular joint. However, the recovered mobility of the arthrotic upper ankle joint also activated the patient's arthrosis, associated with severe pain. As there was no contraindication to upper ankle joint replacement, a cement-free prosthesis was implanted. Three months after surgery, the patient was mobile, with good foot rolling properties without orthopedic aids, and without pain in his upper joint ankle. In terms of biomechanics an upper ankle joint endoprosthesis is a superior alternative to arthrodesis in haemophilia patients. In order to minimize the complication rate, the treatment of haemophilia patients should be restricted to specially equipped interdisciplinary treatment centers with adequately trained and experienced surgeons as well as haemostaseologists. ","685":"Although hospitals primarily provide treatment for in-patients, treatment is also given to a large number of out-patients. The law covering haemophilia patients, who receive their treatment as out-patients, actually has several different bases. This has advantages and disadvantages. The question concerning us: Which, at the moment, is the best legal basis for any care-agreement? Another important factor for any agreement between the two parties, is that there should be a broad consensus, based on shared interests. The common aim should be the future guarantee for the treatment of patients suffering from haemophilia in suitable medical facilities. At the same time care must be taken to provide an efficient and economically viable care-service for these patients, as well as ensuring that the quality and efficiency of the service remain transparent.","686":"With early prophylactic treatment our haemophilic children grow up in good health. Nevertheless, we cannot prevent every bleeding. Those bleedings may be just subclinical but they could lead to overloading of the knee and more and more of the ankle joint in the long term. Motion analysis can help to understand this process and prevent it. A comparison of the gait function of haemophilic and healthy children of the age 3-18 years showed distinct functional differences especially in the youngest age group (3-6 years). Apparently, the coordination skill gait rhythm was significantly worse in the heamophilic group. All measured functional deficits can be treated with physiotherapy. Possible reasons for these early functional differences are overprotection and\/or early subclinical bleedings.","687":"The collaboration between the Paul-Ehrlich-Institute (PEI) and the GTH as well as the two patient organisations, DHG and IGH has been official since February 2007 with the signing of the collaboration contract. In December 2008, the University of Munich started data enrollment. The DHR is a new software development which includes matters and modules of epidemiological as well as clinical cancer registries. Instead of collaborating with a trustee for personal data the DHR is using a so called \"Intermediate\". Intermediate is an independent software module installed on a separate server without hard disk and with solely random access memory. It receives personal data from the treaters over the internet, calculates the pseudonyms, which are then forwarded to the database. The Intermediate needs to be protected from data access by the PEI and its operating system and software has to be started afresh with each start. These facts require the involvement of a trustworthy third party. It shuts Intermediate off from the PEI without itself coming into the possession of personal data.","688":"Severe stroke in children and adolescents with its devastating long term consequences remains a rare disorder with many open questions. Beside the well known risk factors such as infection or congenital and acquired heart disease, coagulation disorders have to be considered in the differential work up of the underlying aetiology. Here we report the case of an adolescent with a homozygote MTHFR 677CT mutation suffering a malignant stroke shortly after the start of oral contraceptives. Since prevention seems easily feasible, general screening for MTHFR mutations might be worthwhile in women before starting oral contraceptives. ","689":"Treatment of haemophiliacs with inhibitors is of great concern in low-income countries confronting shortage in substitutive treatment. Invasive interventions on these patients represent a major challenge due to the fact that costs are significantly higher in comparison to similar procedures conducted on patients without inhibitors. In the context of insufficient availability of clotting factor, we aimed at highlighting the experience of surgical treatment in inhibitor patients. We analyzed the indications, types of performed interventions and outcomes. This single center, retrospective analysis has been conducted on 7 inhibitor patients registered and treated in Haemophilia Center of Timisoara over ten years (1997-2007): six patients with severe hemophilia A (3 - high titer, 3 - low titer), one patient with von Willebrand disease (low titer).Three patients developed inhibitors only after 2-5 days post surgery. A total of 15 invasive procedures were carried out: 2 orthopedic interventions (1 arthrodesis, 1 arthroscopic synovectomy), 2 urogenital interventions (1 surgical testicular detorsion, 1 orchiectomy), 4 limb amputations (2 bilateral upper and 2 lower limb amputation), 2 pseudotumour (PT) surgery interventions, 5 drainages (2 massive pyohaemothorax, 1 drainage of shank haematoma, 1 drainage of compressive forearm haematoma, 1 drainage of thigh haematoma). Haemostasis was achieved in patients with low level inhibitors (&lt; 5 BU\/ml) with high doses of FVIII concentrates; in those with high inhibitor level (&gt; 5 BU\/ml), surgery was managed using by-passing agents. Supplementation with local fibrin glue and intravenous or local antifibrinolytic agents was given in 68.75% of interventions. Postoperative complications consisted of haemorrhagic shock in 13.33% of interventions and infection in 6.66%. Haemostatic outcome was evaluated by blood loss and duration of treatment, compared to expectations for non-inhibitor patients. The outcome was excellent and good in 66.66% of interventions, and fair in 33.33%. Discussion, conclusion: Indication of invasive procedures in haemophiliacs with inhibitors was limited to life and\/or limb-threatening situations. In low-income countries, inhibitor and recovery of FVIII monitoring is mandatory in the postoperative follow-up of patients with low or no substitution prior to surgery due to false negative results at the preoperative investigation. ","690":"","691":"Antiplatelet agents and anticoagulants are effective in the prevention and treatment of a variety of thrombotic disorders. Several clinical settings require more intense antithrombotic regimens. These can be provided by combining (i) two antiplatelet drugs, (ii) antiplatelet monotherapy with an anticoagulant, or (iii) anticoagulation with dual antiplatelet treatment (triple therapy). A major side effect of all antithrombotic regimens, however, is the induction of a bleeding diathesis. This is especially true in patients with preexisting haemostatic defects of any kind that may remain compensated, unless platelet function and\/or coagulation are not inhibited pharmacologically. To address the dilemma of the \"double-edged sword\" between thrombosis and bleeding, several strategies are currently under study, including (i) identification of high-risk patients, (ii) stratification of patient subgroups, (iii) individualized decision making, and (iv) administration of \"tailor-made\" risk-adapted regimens. Nonetheless, prevention and protection from bleeding in patients using antithrombotic agents remain an enduring challenge. For high-risk patients on antiplatelet agents with urgent need of surgery, an algorithm is discussed that allows short-term interruption of oral antithrombotic therapy and i.v. administration of a GPIIb-IIIa receptor antagonist for bridging without increasing perioperative bleeding. When individual patients, using antiplatelet or anticoagulant agents, experience serious or even life-threatening haemorrhages, haemotherapy with platelet units or prothrombin complex concentrates remains an integral part of the clinical management.","692":"The P2Y12 receptor has proven to be a key target in the prevention of complications associated with atherosclerotic vascular disease especially in the context of acute coronary syndrome and percutaneous coronary intervention in addition to aspirin. Three generations of thienopyridines, ticlopidine, clopidogrel, and prasugrel have proven efficacy in the prevention of ischemic vascular events but with increased bleeding. The concept of individualized tailored therapy has recently emerged with the discovery of the diminished effect of some thienopyridine among carriers of the loss-of-function cytochrome (CYP) P4502C19*2 variant. Non-thienopyridine P2Y12 antagonists have also recently demonstrated that these benefits are not limited to one class of agents or may be generalizable to reversible antagonists of this receptor. Future rational use of these agents will require attention to disease and patient features to strike the optimal balance of benefit to risk.","693":"Percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) has significantly improved clinical outcomes in coronary artery disease patients. Since PCI is associated with platelet activation, antiplatelet therapy with aspirin, clopidogrel and GPIIb\/IIIa inhibitors comprise the cornerstone strategy during and following PCI. The latter agents are arguably the most important drugs we administer to the patient with established coronary artery disease since they are specifically given to prevent the most catastrophic event, the formation of an occlusive arterial thrombus. Numerous clinical trials have confirmed the efficacy of antiplatelet therapy in attenuating recurrent ischaemic event occurrence. Despite the extensive use of antiplatelet therapies, ischaemic event occurrence such as post-procedural myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis still remains an important concern and highlights the need for improved treatment strategies. A major limitation of current treatment is the application of a \"one size fits all\" strategy advocated by the guidelines that completely ignores the evaluation of the individual antiplatelet response. Pharmacodynamic studies have revealed the limitations of aspirin and clopidogrel treatment that include response variability, and a high prevalence of antiplatelet non-responsiveness associated with significant risk for recurrent ischemic event occurrence. Thus, two major paradoxes in cardiovascular medicine today are: 1) despite the overwhelming evidence that platelet reactivity strongly influences the development of potentially catastrophic events including myocardial infarction and stent thrombosis in the PCI patient, no measurement is made in clinical practice to assess the presence of blood vulnerability (platelet reactivity) and 2) despite the overwhelming evidence that the effect of dual antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and P2Y12 receptor blockers is variable, the guidelines largely recommend a uniform, \"one size fits all\" dosing of these agents in the PCI patient without any confirmation of an adequate antiplatelet effect.","694":"Activation of the coagulation cascade and platelet functions occurs in ACS and may lead to subsequent thrombus formation, vessel occlusion, distal embolisation, myocardial ischaemia, necrosis and eventually death. Over the last 20 years, the outcome of ACS and PCI patients has considerably improved, thanks to better pharmacologic environment, urgent reperfusion in STEMI (ST elevation myocardial infarction), timely revascularisation in non-ST elevation ACS (NSTEACS) and improved PCI techniques, particularly widespread use of stents. In this context, bleeding was long considered as inherent to the modern therapeutic approach and without real consequences. Actually, bleeding has a strong impact on outcome, with a four- to five-fold increase in the rate of death, myocardial infarction and stroke at 30 days and six months. In addition, blood transfusion may have deleterious effects. Recent evidence shows that reduced risk of bleeding leads to a reduced risk of ischemic events (death, myocardial infarction and stroke). The exact mechanisms by which bleeding impacts on outcome are as yet poorly understood. The interruption of active treatment may play an important role. Activation of coagulation or inflammation in case of bleeding, and depletion of 2,3DPG and nitric oxide, inflammatory and immunologic reactions triggered by blood transfusion, are among the potential mechanisms. Prevention of bleeding has become as important as prevention of ischaemic events. Risk stratification for bleeding is as important as overall risk stratification for further ischaemic events. In patients at high risk of bleeding, appropriate choice and dosage of drugs, combinations of drugs, and the use of radial rather than femoral approach are essential components of bleeding prevention.","695":"Despite the clinical benefit associated with the combined use of aspirin and clopidogrel in patients with acute coronary syndrome or those undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention, a considerable interindividual variability in response to these drugs have been consistently reported. There is a growing interest on applying platelet functional tests with the goal of identifying patients at increased risk of recurrent ischaemic events and potentially tailoring antiplatelet treatment regimens. This manuscript will review the state of the art on the most commonly available platelet functional tests, describing their advantages and disadvantages and exploring their applicability in clinical practice.","696":"In primary prevention, aspirin reduces the risk of stroke but not of myocardial infarction in women while in men only the risk of myocardial infarction but not stroke could be significantly reduced. Only aspirin has been shown to be safe and effective in large randomized trials in the first 48 hours after ischemic stroke. Aspirin\/dipyridamole and clopidogrel both reduce the risk of a combined cardiovascular outcome in long-term secondary prevention compared to aspirin alone. More potent antiplatelet drugs or combination of aspirin and clopidogrel prevent more ischemic events, but also lead to more bleeding complications. No benefit of oral anticoagulants could be shown in patients with non-cardioembolic stroke. In patients with atrial fibrillation oral anticoagulation is more effective than aspirin in stroke prevention. The choice between oral anticoagulants and aspirin in these patients depends on age and the individual risk factor profile. Patients with symptomatic intracranial stenosis have a higher risk of intracerebral bleeding with oral anticoagulation compared to high dose aspirin. Aspirin is the recommended treatment in stroke patients with a patent foramen ovale.","697":"Serotonin is transported by platelets and released upon activation. This induces constriction of injured blood vessels and enhances platelet aggregation to minimize blood loss. Consequently, serotonin receptor antagonists have been tested for their anti-ischemic potency in atherothrombotic disease. Unfortunately, the results have been contradictory. Recent murine studies found that activation of the platelet serotonin receptor induces shedding of important adhesion molecules. As a consequence, platelets lose their ability to contribute to thrombus formation and may be cleared from the circulation. Serotonin effects on platelets are not only mediated by receptor binding but also by covalently binding effector proteins (serotonylation) in the platelet cytoplasm and on the platelet surface. In conclusion, the effects of serotonin on haemostasis are complex and new antithrombotic strategies have to account for this complexity.","698":"Safeguarding of antiplatelet drug efficacy represents a cornerstone for the optimal treatment of patients with symptomatic coronary artery disease requiring coronary interventions. This means a challenge to modern cardiology since there has been cumulative evidence, that response to common oral antiplatelet therapy is a highly variable phenomenon underlying various mechanisms. It is known, that particular risk groups exhibit a high residual platelet aggregability (RPA) despite conventional antiplatelet therapy. Additionally, a relevant association between high RPA and recurrent ischaemic events after PCI exists. Individualization of antiplatelet therapy by dose increase or alternative application of novel P2Y12-receptor antagonists might lead to improved cardiovascular outcome in patients with poor responsiveness to conventional antiplatelet therapy. Identification of risk patients who might benefit from tailored therapy by increased net benefit without excess of major bleedings means a challenge. Clinical risk scores might help in the process of risk stratification and therapeutic decision. Subsequently, literature on risk assessment for antiplatelet drug responsiveness and different strategies will be discussed to identify patients who might benefit from personalized antiplatelet strategies.","699":"The role of GP IIb\/IIIa antagonists has been focused on patients with acute coronary syndromes undergoing PCI. In the ISAR-REACT 2 study abciximab given in patients with NSTE-ACS undergoing PCI already treated with 600 mg clopidogrel improved 30-day death and reinfarction rate in troponin positive patients. In the large EARLY-ACS trial upstream therapy with eptifibatide in high risk with NSTE-ACS did not improve ischaemic complications but was associated with an increase in bleeding complications. Therefore GP IIb\/IIIa antagonists should be given after the initial angiography and the decision the perform PCI in troponin positive patients with NSTE-ACS. In patients with STEMI undergoing primary PCI the prehospital administration of tirofiban was associated with an improved myocardial reperfusion. In contrast in the BRAVE 3 trial abciximab in patients with pretreatment with 600 mg clopidogrel did not reduce infarct size or improve clinical outcome. Comparative trials evaluating the effectiveness of abciximab and the small molecules tirofiban and eptifibatide did not show any differences between the three GP IIb\/IIIa antagonists.","700":"Morbidity and mortality in patients with atherothrombotic disease remain high despite the use of antiplatelet therapy with aspirin and an ADP receptor antagonist. Selective inhibition of the principal protease-activated receptor (PAR)-1 for thrombin, the most potent agonist for platelet activation, represents a promising novel strategy to reduce thrombosis and ischaemic events. SCH 530348, a potent thrombin receptor antagonist (TRA) selective for PAR-1, has been evaluated in preclinical studies, demonstrating complete and sustained inhibition of thrombin\/TRAP-induced platelet aggregation without a concomitant increase in the risk of bleeding. Phase 2 studies in patients undergoing non-urgent or urgent PCI showed that treatment with SCH 530348 in addition to the standard of care (aspirin plus an ADP receptor antagonist) is not associated with an increased risk of TIMI bleeding and is well tolerated, with a rate of adverse events comparable to standard therapy alone. These studies also demonstrated that the use of SCH 530348 in combination with aspirin and an ADP receptor antagonist may reduce the incidence of major adverse cardiac events, specifically periprocedural myocardial infarction, vs aspirin plus an ADP receptor antagonist alone. On the basis of these encouraging results, 2 ongoing large phase 3 randomized trials are evaluating the efficacy and safety of SCH 530348 in combination with the standard-of-care therapy in approximately 35,000 patients with NSTE ACS or established atherosclerosis.","701":"Currently available clinical database was mostly developed in North America and Europe (Western Countries). Clinical database of Asian patients are still not large enough to develop Asian region specific clinical guidelines, although the population of patients in the majority of Asia countries are increasing rapidly. Marked ethnic and life-style heterogeneity within Asian region also makes it difficult to develop Asian region specific Evidence-based clinical practice guidelines. In general, there are certain differences in the background epidemiology of the atherosclerotic and thrombotic diseases in Asia countries and Western ones such as Asian patients are more prone to cerebrovascular disease (CVD) than coronary artery disease (CAD). Accordingly, there also are marked differences in the use of antiplatelet agents in Asian patients underwent coronary intervention (such as frequent use of cilostazol) as compared to those living in the Western countries. Currently available database also suggests the difference in side effects of antiplatelet agents in Asian patients as compared to Western ones such as relatively high incidence of hepatic dysfunction with the use of thienopiridine. In the future, it would be important to clarify the detailed difference of Asian patients and Western ones in regards to the effects and side effects of antiplatelet therapy by the multi-national prospective observation registry and clinical trials including equal number of Asian and Western patients. It would also be important for Asian physician to develop scientifically valid methods to import the results of \"Global Evidence\" with appropriate modification for the clinical practice in patients living in the specific region of Asia.","702":"In contrast to heparins and oral anticoagulants, anti IIa inhibitors (thrombin inhibitors) are able to directly inhibit the protease activity of thrombin and can thereby precisely control the blood coagulation process. Direct thrombin inhibitors are either biosimilars (r-hirudin) or synthetically produced substances (bivalirudin, argatroban, dabigatran). In 1997 r-hirudin was introduced into clinical practice, however due to its narrow therapeutic range and the necessity of drug monitoring it has not gained widespread clinical use by now. Since 2004 and 2005 the synthetic thrombin inhibitors bivalirudin and argatroban, respectively, are available. With dabigatran the first oral synthetic thrombin inhibitor followed in 2008. These four drugs can inhibit even clot bound thrombin and show low plasma protein binding. They differ in respect to route and duration of application as well as elimination from the body, thereby offering a precise inhibition of blood coagulation adjusted to the individual case and without danger of HIT II. These advantages shall be used and advanced by the development of further direct thrombin inhibitors.","703":"In respect to the actual discussion of new anticoagulants in secondary haemostasis, we will give a short review on established oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists and parenteral anticoagulation by use of heparin. The different coumarin derivatives phenprocoumon, warfarin, and acenocoumarol are compared concerning to the management and influence of pharmacogenetic and pharmacokinetic factors. Studies to improve the safety of oral anticoagulation by vitamin K supplementation will be briefly discussed. The therapy with heparins include until now some problems of dose-response control. It is necessary to pay attention to contra-indications even for well known anticoagulants. Examples for that will be given.","704":"Comparative investigation concerning gelfiltration as well as haemostaseologic analysis of venoms and venom fractions of some snakes (elapidae and viperidae) have shown that in elapidae an inhibition of coagulation is dominant whilst in viperidae the stimulation of coagulation is of importance. Our investigations produce a basis to select substances for activation of coagulation and substances for inhibition of coagulation. Under pharmacological viewpoints the data may produce information to use snake fractions for anticoagulation or for procoagulant therapy in bleeding tendency.","705":"This article provides an overview on current commercially available methods to determine primary haemostasis as a target of drug-mediated anticoagulation. It focuses on whole blood methods only, and references the currently major achievements that have been reported with each method in respect to its clinical use. Advantages and disadvantages of the various methods are presented, based on considerations of platelet physiology, and on feasibility of the procedures.","706":"Vitamin K-antagonists and heparin belong to the established indirect acting anticoagulants. For many years these drugs were the only possibility for prophylaxis and treatment of venous and arterial thrombosis. The challenges for the routine laboratory related to the treatment with vitamin K-antagonists and heparin can be regarded as solved. However, in recent years a rapid development of new anticoagulants began. Although they are developed with guidelines for use without monitoring, the control of effective levels may be necessary in selected cases. As a consequence new challenges for the routine laboratory have to be solved. This paper presents an overview concerning monitoring methods.","707":"Oral anticoagulation with a vitamin K-antagonist requires special consideration when surgery or interventional procedures are planned. This is mainly due to the half life of vitamin K-antagonists and to the need for safe and effective anticoagulation prior to and during surgery as well as in the postoperative period. So far, the continuous infusion of unfractionated heparin (UFH) has been the medication of choice to \"bridge\" patients to surgery. The use of low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) has been prospectively investigated in this setting and represents a safe alternative. The advantages of LMWH are the better dose-response relationship and reduced need for monitoring. This facilitates the bridging procedure to be started out of hospital, which may reduce hospital stay and associated costs. Furthermore, the so-called bridging of patients with oral anticoagulation prior to and during surgery reduces bleeding complications and maintains a safe anticoagulation for patients at risk.","708":"Inhibition of platelet function plays an important role in the treatment and secondary prevention of cardiovascular or cerebrovascular ischemic diseases. Established antiplatelet agents use different pharmacological targets for this role. Acetyl salicylic acid achieves a reduction of thromboxane A2 formation by inhibition of COX-1. Ticlopidine or clopidogrel are ADP-P2Y12 receptor antagonists. Tirofiban, abciximab or eptifibatid are used for the inhibition of the glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa receptor which is activated at the surface of platelets preceding the final step of their aggregation. The mechanism of dipyridamole is based on the inhibition of adenosine uptake and of phosphodiesterase-5. Efforts are made to improve antiplatelet therapy with the aim to find agents with favorable clinical outcome and lower bleeding risk. Current clinical studies focus on a new generation of ADP receptor antagonists (prasugrel, cangrelor and ticagrelor) as successors of ticlopidine and clopidogrel after coronary arterial interventions. Developments using platelet targets different from established drugs are thrombin receptor antagonists (like SCH530348) or thromboxane receptor antagonists (like S18886\/terutroban) in patients with cerebrovascular events. Results from recent experimental studies could lead to new strategies for antiplatelet therapy (like inhibition of GP Ib receptor, GP VI receptor, platelet-leukocyte interaction, factor XII and others) in the future.","709":"Antiplatelet therapy has demonstrated significant clinical benefit in the treatment of acute coronary syndrome. However, as with any treatment strategy it has been unable to prevent all cardiovascular events. This is far from surprising when considering the complexity of arterial thrombosis and more specifically platelet physiology. This lack of treatment success has provoked the introduction of various diagnostic tests and testing platforms with the intent of guiding and optimizing clinical treatment. Such tests have resulted in the generation of clinical data that suggest suboptimal response to antiplatelet agents such as aspirin and clopidogrel. In the case of both aspirin and clopidogrel, this suboptimal response has been termed resistance. Drug resistance would imply a lack of pharmacological response that has not been specifically investigated in many of the clinical studies performed to date. Rather, the term resistance has been used to describe various facets of platelet activation and aggregation relative to the testing method. Many of these measured parameters are not addressed in the therapeutic intent of the antiplatelet drug in question.","710":null,"711":"","712":"A 14 year old boy was referred to us for a detailed coagulation study because a previously performed aPTT has been found prolonged. The boy had no history of bleeding symptoms and also the family history was negative for bleeding or thrombotic events. The aPTT in the patient was 96 s (reference range: 24-36 s), prothrombin time and thrombin time were both normal. As the cause for the prolonged aPTT we identified a severe prekallikrein deficiency (prekallikrein activity &lt; 1%). The prekallikrein deficiency results from two mutations in the KLKB 1-gene: first, an insertion of 1 bp in codon 149 in exon 5 and, second, a base exchange Cys 548 (TGC) &gt; Tyr (TAC) in exon 14. The boy inherited the first mutation from his father and the second from his mother. The mutation in the paternal allele was not described before the completion of our study. There are two brothers of the propositus, one with normal prekallikrein activity and no mutations in the KLKB1-gene, the other showed the same constellation as the propositus.","713":"We have prospectively evaluated the biologic response to desmopressin (DDAVP) in 28 children with type 2 von Willebrand disease (VWD) in correlation with the phenotype and the molecular defect of VWF. The diagnosis of VWD type 2 was mainly based on VWF functional parameters and\/or an aberrant VWF multimer pattern. Seventeen different mutations were identified (6 of them novel). No response with respect to the functional parameters VWF:RCo and\/or VWF:CB was seen in patients with severe abnormality of the VWF multimer pattern. One patient with VWD type 2A phenotype IIC Miami did not respond with respect to VWF:CB, but showed a good response of VWF:Ag and FVIII:C as expected. Interestingly he showed a persistently high level of VWF:Ag and FVIII:C up to 4 hours after DDAVP infusion. Patients with minor alterations of multimer structure and particular mutations responded well to DDAVP, whereas patients with normal multimer structure but a defect in platelet dependent functional parameters did not respond with VWF:RCo. Children with VWD type 2 show a variable response to desmopressin depending on the mutation that correlates with the functional defect and the presence or absence as well as the half-life of large VWF multimers. Our data emphasize the usefulness of DDAVP testing even in patients with VWD type 2, possibly with the exception of VWD type 2B. ","714":"The risk of thromboembolic events (TE) is increased by acquired or inherited thrombophilias (IT). We know that some hormonal contraceptives also increase the risk of thrombosis, thus, the use of such contraceptives are discussed as contraindications in women with IT. TEs are infrequent events in children and adolescents and in the majority of cases are associated with secondary complications from underlying chronic illness. Although adolescents are not typically considered to be at high-risk for TE, this cohort is frequently using hormonal contraception, leading to an increased risk in cases with unknown IT. The risk of TE with pregnancy alone is higher than associated with combined hormonal contraception. Progestin-only methods have not been found to increase the risk of TE with only moderate changes of coagulation proteins compared to normal reference values. Thrombophilic women are good candidates for progestin-only contraceptive methods. ","715":"The development of neutralizing alloantibodies (inhibitors) to factor VIII (FVIII) is one of the most serious complications in the treatment of haemophiliacs. Inhibitors occur in approximately 20 to 30% of previously untreated patients (PUPs), predominantly children, with severe haemophilia A within the first 50 exposure days (ED). Immune tolerance induction (ITI) leads to complete elimination of the inhibitor in up to 80% of the patients and offers the possibility to restore regular FVIII prophylaxis. However, patients with high titre inhibitors, in whom standard ITI fails, usually impose with high morbidity and mortality and therefore prompting physicians to alternate therapy regimens. Rituximab, an anti-CD 20 monoclonal antibody has been successfully used in children and adults for the management of B-cell mediated disorders. We report on the use of a new protocol including rituximab in two adolescents with severe haemophilia A and high titre inhibitors, severe bleeding tendency and high clotting factor consumption after failing standard ITI. Both patients received a concomitant treatment with FVIII according to the Bonn protocol, cyclosporine A and immunoglobulin. Treatment with rituximab resulted in a temporary B-cell depletion leading to the disappearance of the inhibitor. FVIII recovery and half-life turned towards normal ranges. In patient 1 the inhibitor reappeared 14 months after the last rituximab administration. In patient 2 complete immune tolerance could be achieved for 60 months. Bleeding frequency diminished significantly and clinical joint status improved in both patients. In patient 1 the treatment course was complicated by aspergillosis and hepatitis B infection. Rituximab may be favourable for patients with congenital haemophilia, high-titre inhibitors and a severe clinical course in whom standard ITI has failed. Prospective studies are required to determine safety, efficacy and predictors of success. ","716":"Approximately 70% of children have the acute form of immune thrombocytopenia (ITP), which is defined by recovery within six months of presentation with or without treatment. Chronic ITP is to be reserved for patients with platelets &lt; 100000\/microl for more than twelve months and exclusion of other diagnosis like systemic lupus erythematosus or bone marrow failures. In children, the chance of spontaneous recovery is 52% after diagnosis of chronic ITP. The Intercontinental Childhood ITP Study group recommends that children without bleeding may not require therapy regardless of their platelet count. Whereas in patients with bleeding symptoms first line therapy is defined and includes steroids or immunoglobuline, second line therapy in refractory patients with significant hemorrhagic problems is unclear. Guidelines recommend splenectomy, but for more than 50 years patients and physicians look for pharmacological alternatives. It may be that rituximab is a promising option which has been proven to be effective with few adverse effects. Till now the treatment has focused on immunomodulation. Research has now focused on stimulating platelet production. In this review we discuss old and new therapy modalities for children with cITP.","717":"Molecular genetic testing for factor VIII (FVIII) mutations is indicated in haemophilia A since determination of FVIII activity cannot reliably identify female carriers. Given the large number of FVIII mutations the identification of novel mutations is not uncommon. Since amino acid polymorphisms of FVIII are rare, missense mutations in patients with haemophilia A which are not found in the normal population are considered as causative in general practice when no other mutation can be detected by complete FVIII gene sequencing. We report a novel rare missense variant (P2311S) in a haemophilia A family that was mistakenly considered as pathogenic leading to amniocentesis, prenatal diagnosis and influenced the peripartal management of the putatively affected child. Subsequently, we identified the novel causative mutation V197G in the family's index case which could be detected neither in the neonate nor in his mother. This case emphasizes the necessity to establish the molecular diagnosis in the family's index case and to perform expression studies of novel mutations to prove their causative nature. ","718":"Inhibitor development is a rare but serious event in hemophilia B patients. Management is hampered by the frequent occurrence of allergic reactions to factor IX, low success rates of current inhibitor elimination protocols and the risk of development of nephrotic syndrome. Single cases of immune tolerance induction (ITI) including immunosuppressive agents like mycophenolat mofetil (MMF) or rituximab have been reported. We present a case of successful inhibitor elimination with a combined immune-modulating therapy and high-dose factor IX (FIX). This boy had developed a FIX inhibitor at the age of 5 years and had a history of allergic reactions to FIX and to FEIBAO. Under on-demand treatment with recombinant activated FVII the inhibitor became undetectable but the boy suffered from multiple joint and muscle bleeds. At the age of 11.5 years ITI was attempted with a combination of rituximab, MMF, dexamethasone, intravenous immunoglobulins and high-dose FIX. The inhibitor did not reappear and FIX half-life normalized. No allergic reaction, no signs of nephrotic syndrome and no serious infections were observed.","719":"To determine the frequency and clinical relevance of acquired von Willebrand syndrome (aVWS) due to antiepileptic therapy by valproic acid, we investigated 50 consecutive children in three neuropediatric institutions. Coagulation factors were determined in local laboratories before and three times after starting therapy with valproic acid. Parameters of von Willebrand factor (VWF) were additionally investigated in a reference laboratory including multimeric analysis. Significant changes in the coagulation system were found concerning fibrinogen (decreased from 287 +\/- 70 mg\/dl to 222 +\/- 67 mg\/dl; p &lt; 0.001) and platelet count. Changes of VWF parameters were also found but no patient developed laboratory defined aVWS. We conclude that the bleeding tendency observed in some children undergoing antiepileptic therapy with valproic acid is not due to aVWS.","720":"Bernard-Soulier syndrome (BSS) is a rare, autosomal recessive inherited bleeding disorder associated with thrombocytopenia, thrombocytopathy and giant platelets. BSS is caused by genetic alterations of the glycoprotein (GP) Ib\/V\/IX complex. We report on a large Swiss family of whom four family members suffer from BSS. Here, a homozygous missense mutation in position 1829 (A(R)G) of the GPIX gene constituting a N45S substitution is the cause for the bleeding symptoms. A total of 38 family members within two generations were analyzed regarding the N45S mutation by DNA sequencing and restriction fragment length polymorphism. The laboratory parameters which are characteristically for BSS such as platelet count, platelet volume and the expression of CD42a (GPIX), CD42b (GPIbalpha) and CD41 (GPIIb) were measured for all 38 individuals. The four homozygous patients showed bleeding symptoms, thrombocytopenia and giant platelets. In these patients, the expression of CD42a (GPIX), CD42b (GPIbalpha) was diminished. Interestingly, the intensity of the bleeding symptoms of the 4 homozygous family members seemed to vary although they carry the same mutation. The 24 heterozygous carriers did not differ significantly from their 10 wildtype family members regarding bleeding symptoms and laboratory analysis.","721":"The genotype-phenotype relationship of compound heterozygous factor X deficiency in a young girl with severe factor X deficiency and bleeding symptoms is characterized. We identified a novel deletion of exon 6 and a missense mutation (c.856G&gt;A, Val286Met) in exon 7 of the F10 gene leading to a compound heterozygous state and causing severe factor X deficiency. Therapeutic options for patients with symptomatic factor X deficiency are demonstrated.","722":"Every year in Germany nearly 3000 cases of child abuse were reported. When children are presented at emergency units with suspicious injuries and bruises a detailed documentation an evaluation is necessary after emergency treatment. As differential diagnosis inherited or acquired bleeding disorders should be excluded. In addition to a detailed evaluation of personal and family history and a physical evaluation different coagulation test to exclude defects of primary and secondary hemostasis should be performed. Clinician must know the limitations of these tests and keep in mind that an abnormal coagulation test does not exclude child abuse. Coagulation defects may be the consequence of child abuse and neglect or the two conditions may coexist.","723":"The Aspirin-like defect (ALD) is caused by defects in the intraplatelet arachidonic acid (AA)-metabolism. We here present the characteristics of a larger cohort in a single centre. Based on 17 ALD index patients bleeding symptoms, agonist-induced platelet aggregation and closure times in the PFA-100 test were analysed in a family cohort of altogether 52 individuals from 17 families. Absent aggregation to AA (maximal aggregation &lt;or= 10%) was the main diagnostic criterion. A mild ALD was diagnosed when aggregation was 11-40%. In addition to 17 ALD index patients, 13 family members displayed ALD. 4 family members were diagnosed with a mild ALD. Epistaxis, easy bruising, menorrhagia and perioperative hemorrhage were the most common bleeding symptoms, whereas three quarters of ALD patients presented with &gt;or=1 bleeding symptoms. In case of a bleeding tendency diagnostic procedures should rule out primary haemostatic defects. Hereditary platelet function defects including ALD are an important differential diagnosis. Family studies are reasonable. ","724":"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT II) in childhood is rare. Suspected HIT II requires immediate diagnostic and therapeutic measures in order to avoid potentially life threatening complications. Heparin must be stopped immediately. We report on a 6-year old boy who required cardiac surgery due to tetralogy of Fallot. To our knowledge he had been exposed to heparin for the first time during cardiac catheterization on the day before surgery. Preoperatively, platelet count was normal. Postoperatively (3 days after heparin exposure), he developed pulmonary and renal failure and required inotropic cardiac support and dialysis. He also developed progressive (severe) thrombocytopenia under heparin therapy on day 2-3 postoperatively. The dialysis filter required daily exchanges due to clotting despite increasing heparin doses. The first ELISA for HIT on postop day 4 was negative. 3 days later a repeated test was positive. Von Willebrand factor antigen and D-dimers were markedly increased. The patient was immediately switched to lepirudin and subsequently stabilized slowly. No major systemic thrombosis occurred. After lepirudin treatment for 6 weeks the patient was fully recovered and HIT II-testing was negative again. In children with progressive thrombocytopenia in the setting of heparin exposure and signs of major or micro thrombosis HIT II must be ruled out. Even if a first early test turns out negative repeated testing should be performed. Lepirudin anticoagulation is effective and should be monitored correctly. Platelet transfusion should be avoided in HITII. ","725":"The most serious complication of haemophilia A is development of a high-titre factor VIII (FVIII) inhibitor which renders the patient unresponsive to FVIII replacement. Bleeding complications can only be controlled using FVIII-inhibitor bypassing agents but their effect is less certain. The ultimate goal is to eliminate the inhibitor by immune tolerance induction therapy (ITI) using daily high doses of FVIII. The success rate of ITI using various protocols is between 56 and 79% (1, 2). If ITI is unsuccessful, the inhibitor usually persists throughout life. We report on a patient with a high titre FVIII inhibitor that persisted after ITI but spontaneously disappeared 15 years later.","726":"Recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa; NovoSeven) is, besides other indications, authorised for the treatment of bleeding episodes in patients with hereditary haemophilia A or B and inhibitors. Based on the results of three clinical studies, marketing authorisation was granted for the single dose of 270 microg\/kg body weight rFVIIa for the treatment of mild to moderate bleeding episodes in patients with haemophilia A or B with inhibitors in March 2007. Thereupon, an expert group analysed the relevance of this additional treatment option for clinical routine. Compared with the repeated application of 90 microg\/kg body weight rFVIIa, quality of life may be improved if the single dose of 270 microg\/kg body weight rFVIIa reduces the number of injections. The single dose has a benefit for those patients who require several rFVIIa applications or who do not respond adequately to low doses. Moreover, patients with poor venous access or patients who fear injections or reject them (especially children) may benefit from the single dose. The prescription of 270 microg\/kg body weight rFVIIa as a single dose instead of multiple dosing of 90 microg\/kg body weight is basically an individual and indication-related decision.","727":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a known complication of cancer which impacts on patient mortality and quality of life. Despite the known deleterious effects of VTE, the benefits of thromboprophylaxis have not been fully established. Identification of patients at highest risk of VTE could lead to better targeting of thromboprophylaxis. Several risk factors have been identified as contributing to VTE such as site and stage of cancer, age, comorbidities, obesity, and acquired prothrombotic states. Anti-cancer agents as well as the use of growth factor support have also been implicated in VTE. Recent data have identified biomarkers such as blood counts, tissue factor and P-selectin. In this review, we briefly summarize the risk factors for VTE as well as candidate biomarkers for VTE in cancer patients. We also review a validated risk score that can identify cancer patients at high risk for VTE. Risk stratification of cancer patients will allow clinicians to identify those patients at highest risk for VTE, who may derive the most benefit from thromboprophylaxis.","728":"Epidemiological studies revealed that most antineoplastic agents and regimes enhance the risk of venous and arterial thromboembolic events in cancer patients. The purpose of this article is to review clinical and pathophysiological data related to chemotherapy-associated thromboembolism under special consideration of newer treatment strategies, such as angiogenesis inhibitors and immunmodulatory agents. Despite numerous clinical and experimental studies it has to be concluded that we are far from a comprehensive understanding of the pathogenesis of chemotherapy-associated thrombosis.","729":"A large number of hereditary and acquired alterations in the coagulation system that are associated with an increased risk of venous thrombosis have been described. Screening for these thrombophilic defects has become particularly popular in women before the prescription of oral contraceptives. The relevance of the results with regard to the management of the patients remains, however, to be questioned. In a recent review of six articles that were aimed to determine the nature and extent of psychological impact of thrombophilia screening, no valid conclusions could be drawn about the psychological impact due to heterogeneity of the data and lack of methodological accuracy. We performed a questionnaire-based study in 247 women with and in 132 women without factor V Leiden who were referred for factor V Leiden testing before oral contraceptive intake. A large proportion (76%) of the women reported being emotionally disturbed by genetic testing. 16% of women with wildtype factor V were discouraged from OC use, while 3% of women with factor V Leiden were encouraged to take OC. This indicates that recommendations after testing are not consistently driven by the test result, which compromises the quality of patient care. Given the large number of women who are taking oral contraceptives unequivocal guidelines for counseling prior to their prescription are urgently needed. These guidelines should integrate the risks and benefits of oral contraceptives but also the impact of screening on quality of life and aspects of counselling.","730":"Critical limb ischaemia (CLI) is a manifestation of peripheral arterial disease (PAD) that describes patients with chronic ischaemic rest pain, or patients with ischaemic skin lesions, either ulcers or gangrene. The clinical diagnosis of CLI should be confirmed by haemodynamic parameters such as the ankle- or toe systolic pressure. The estimated annual incidence of CLI ranges between 500 and 1 000 new cases per 1 million, with diabetes being the most important risk factor. CLI is also a marker for mostly generalized and severe atherosclerosis, and therefore the prognosis of patients is poor concerning overall survival. The primary goals of treatment in patients with CLI are to relieve ischaemic pain, heal ulcers, prevent limb loss, improve patient function and quality of life and prolong overall survival. Any kind of revascularization should be done whenever technically possible, and therefore most patients should be referred to a vascular center. Furthermore, in patients with CLI a multidisciplinary approach is recommended to control pain, cardiovascular risk factors and other co-morbid disease. In patients with CLI not eligible for arterial revascularization, prostanoids are the only vasoactive drugs with proven efficacy. The safety and efficacy of the various forms of therapeutic angiogenesis still have to be proven before one can conclude on its role as an additional limb saving strategy.","731":"Cardioembolism accounts for approximately 20% of ischaemic strokes, and is associated with high mortality and propensity to recurrences. Approximately, 30% of ischaemic strokes remain cryptogenic despite improved imaging modalities and technological improvements to identify their cause. Of the long list of various cardiac conditions associated with an increased risk of cardioembolic strokes, non-valvular atrial fibrillation is the most common cause. Unsurprisingly, the stroke risk associated with these conditions is highly variable and non-homogenous, with many risk factors additive to the overall risk profile. Treatment with vitamin K-antagonists substantially reduces the long-term complications associated with cardioembolism in some high-risk patients, for example, in atrial fibrillation. Careful selection of antithrombotic drug regime needs to be carried out in patients individually to minimise the risk of bleeding encountered with such therapy. Apart from atrial fibrillation, there is relatively limited evidence for the role of antithrombotic therapy for other cardiac conditions associated with cardioembolism and how long one should treat.","732":"Prevention of deep vein thrombosis has become standard of care in surgical and orthopaedic patients and it is gaining in attention in medical patients. However, there are still open questions related to its indication, to type and extent of prophylaxis and how to improve its efficacy and safety. In order to facilitate decision making to provide or to withhold prophylaxis, clinical risk assessment considering exposing and predisposing risk factors has proved to be of value. The exposing risk is characterised by type and extent of surgery or trauma, respectively, whereas the predisposing risk is determined by patient related risk factors. This has also been acknowledged in national and international guidelines. The choice of prophylactic modalities should be based on the combination of exposing and predisposing risk factors. Physical and pharmacological methods are available for primary prevention of VTE. The cornerstones of pharmacological prophylaxis have been subcutaneous injections of low molecular weight heparins or fondaparinux. Recently, also oral direct thrombin- and factor Xa-inhibitors have become available for patients undergoing hip or knee replacement surgery who always are at high risk for VTE complications.","733":"The past decade has seen a dramatic increase in pediatric stroke research. However few studies have addressed antithrombotic safety or effectiveness. Three paediatric stroke guidelines combining research data with expert consensus have been published in the past five years. For most patients treatment recommendations are consistent. Newborns with arterial ischaemic stroke (AIS) rarely require antithrombotic treatment given their extremely low risk of recurrence. In children with AIS a substantial recurrence risk means that antithrombotic treatment is required unless contraindicated. Anticoagulation (heparins, warfarin) is recommended for possible or established dissection and cardiogenic embolism. Antiplatelet treatment is recommended for other children with AIS. For neonatal cerebral sinovenous thrombosis (CSVT) most centers provide initial anticoagulation in the absence of haemorrhagic contra indications, and otherwise, monitor for propagation. Children with CSVT, even with haemorrhagic infarction, more consistently receive anticoagulation, as in adults. While more studies are necessary, current treatment guidelines offer an interim option for guiding the treatment of paediatric stroke.","734":"Antithrombotic therapy has recently become more frequent for the treatment of venous thromboembolism (VTE) in the paediatric population. This can be explained by the increased awareness of morbidities and mortalities of VTE in children, as well as the improved survival rate of children with various kinds of serious illnesses. Considering the large number of years a child is expected to survive, associated morbidities such as postthrombotic syndrome and risk of recurrence can significantly impact on the quality of life in children. Therefore, timely diagnosis, evidence-based treatment and prophylaxis strategies are critical to avoid such complications. This review summarizes the current literature about the antithrombotic treatment for VTE in infants and children. It guides the paediatric medical care provider for making a logical and justifiable decision.","735":"First generation thrombopoietic growth factors (rhTPO and PEG-rHuMGDF), investigated in the early 2000s, proved effective in increasing platelet count in normal volunteers, in thrombocytopenia due to chemotherapy and also in a few cases of immune thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). These agents did not complete their clinical development since one of them induced antibodies in the recipients that cross reacted with endogenous thrombopoietin (TPO), thus causing thrombocytopenia. This promoted the ingenious design of a new generation of thrombopoietic growth factors having no sequence homology with natural TPO. The two main agents are romiplostim, a peptibody already approved for clinical use in USA and eltrombopag, a non-peptide, orally active small molecule. In open label and placebo-controlled trials both agents proved to predictably increase platelet count in normal volunteers and in patients with ITP. With appropriate dosages (1-10 microg\/kg weekly sub cutaneously for romiplostim; 50-75 mg\/die per os for eltrombopag ) a platelet increase becomes significant after 7-10 days and peaks between 10-14 days. By discontinuing treatment, platelet count returns to baseline level in 10-15 days. The response rate with both agents is above 70-80%, also in patients that had undergone several lines of treatment, or that have failed splenectomy. The response is maintained during the treatment, but is almost invariably lost even after several months of successful administration. Due to the lack of a curative potential and to the incomplete knowledge of long-term side effects, the place of these new drugs in the management of ITP is still unsettled and their use is best restricted to refractory patients or in preparation of splenectomy. It seems however that a new paradigm in the treatment of ITP has been established where the focus is not on reducing platelet consumption but on increasing platelet production.","736":"Immune thrombocytopenia in children is usually a self-limiting illness, but in adults the disease is likely to be chronic, and may be associated with other pathology which predisposes to bleeding. Despite very low platelet counts serious bleeding is rare in both adults and children. More than 80% of children have mild clinical manifestations. Intracranial haemorrhage is rare at all ages, is unpredictable and can occur at any time when the count is very low. Currently recommended therapies for both adults and children are associated with significant side effects and occasional deaths. Treatment may interfere with quality of life more than the illness itself. Drugs can be withheld in the majority of children with appropriate advice to child and family. Treatment can be individualised, taking into account the person's needs and lifestyle as well as bleeding. In chronic ITP many need no active therapy. The situation with adults is more complex but those with a platelet count above 30 x 10(9)\/l usually need no treatment as bleeding is rare, and those adults with refractory ITP unresponsive to treatment live with very low counts for years without significant bleeding suggesting the need to re-evaluate the balance of risks of treatment versus bleeding. It is notable that adults with ITP may die from infection, probably related to therapy.","737":"The current treatment of haemophilia with coagulation protein replacement therapy is both effective and safe. Nevertheless, this therapy requires frequent, repeated intravenous infusions and approximately 25% of treated haemophilia A patients develop antibodies to the replacement protein. Furthermore, the cost and limited availability of current concentrates has restricted access to therapy to less than 30% of the global haemophilia population. With this background, efforts are now underway to develop coagulation concentrates with enhanced biological properties that further improve the quality of care for haemophiliacs. The specific areas of enhancement that are being explored include improved biosynthetic processes, prolonging the circulating half-life and reducing concentrate immunogenicity. Coincident with these approaches, it is hoped that there will be more widespread availability of these concentrates and that their cost will be contained.","738":"Recombinant activated factor VII (rFVIIa) is a pro-haemostatic agent that can be used for patients with haemophilia and inhibiting antibodies towards a coagulation factor. Recombinant factor VIIa is, however, increasingly used for several other indications, including patients who experience serious and life-threatening bleeding. In addition, rFVIIa has been evaluated for the prevention of major blood loss in patients undergoing surgical procedures that are known to be associated with major blood loss. In this manuscript we review the data on efficacy and safety of rFVIIa in the prevention of excessive blood loss and transfusion requirements in the perioperative period. We conclude that recombinant factor VIIa is a promising agent for perioperative prevention of major blood loss but that its efficacy will probably vary between specific clinical settings. Its exact place in surgery warrants further clinical trials in various situations that will also more precisely determine the safety of this intervention.","739":"In Germany, preoperative coagulation tests are commonly used, based on the belief that these tests should identify patients with an increased bleeding risk. However, published evidence does not longer support this approach for both traditional screening tests and novel techniques of global assessment of haemostasis. Unselected screening yields many false positive results and detects irrelevant disorders. It leads to postponement of surgery, anxiety in parents and patients, and is not cost effective. Even worse, it does not reliably detect relevant bleeding disorders such as the most common coagulopathy, von Willebrand disease. The bleeding history of patients and their relatives is a more effective tool to detect patients at risk. According to international guidelines and a joint statement of different German medical societies, a standardized questionnaire should be mandatory in preoperative screening. A diagnostic pathway should be employed to identify patients in whom specific tests are helpful. Because neither laboratory tests nor questionnaires can infallibly predict or exclude perioperative bleeding, guidelines for the management of these unexpected situations have to be established.","740":"Haemorrhagic disorders must be excluded prior to any operation or other invasive procedure that has the potential to involve serious bleeding. When assessing the individual risk of bleeding, screening tests of hemostasis must be combined with the patient's clinical history and symptoms, and any history of bleeding must be explored under direct medical supervision using a standardized questionnaire. However, this bleeding history is neither very specific, nor is it particularly sensitive. Screening tests that have been found to be useful include platelet count, activated partial thrombo plastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT) and clottable fibrinogen. No reliable, sensitive and specific screening test is however available today to screen for platelet dysfunction or von Willebrand disease. A specialized coagulation laboratory should be involved when the bleeding history or laboratory screening indicate a potential haemorrhagic disorder.","741":"Microvesicles (MV) are submicrometric membrane fragments (0.1 to 1 microm), released from the plasma membrane of activated or apoptotic cells. They are characterized by most of the antigenic profile of the cells they originate from, and by the presence of procoagulant phospholipids at their surface. MV are detectable in the peripheral blood of mammals and considered as efficient effectors in the haemostatic or thrombotic responses, able to remotely initiate or amplify beneficial or deleterious processes, depending on the circumstances. Variations in their level and phenotype make them relevant pathogenic markers of thrombotic disorders and vascular damage. To date, MV are recognized as mediators of communication allowing cells to influence a target present in the local microenvironment as well as to at distant sites. The mechanisms by which MV interact with target cells are still unclear, but a number of studies suggest involvement of MV-cell fusion or ligand-receptor interactions. More importantly, MV have been shown implicated in horizontal transfer of genetic material. This review focuses on the role of MV in the context of cancer, and their possible part in cancer associated thrombosis.","742":"Emerging evidence suggests that circulating, cell-derived microparticles (MP) play a role in various physiological and pathophysiological processes. MP are involved in coagulation, inflammation and transportation. The role of circulating MP in the field of obstetrics and gynaecology has been investigated only recently. Healthy women show menstrual cycle-specific differences in circulating MP which differ significantly from age-matched men. With regard to obstetrics, MP were elevated in subgroups of patients with miscarriage or preeclampsia. Whether MP contribute to the pathogenesis of the diseases themselves is part of ongoing research. Moreover, recent studies indicate MP levels parallel tumor invasiveness in breast cancer patients and show similar sensitivity-specificity profiles than established biomarkers.","743":"Obesity is a common disorder and a known risk factor for vascular thrombotic complications. Development of obesity is associated with extensive modifications in adipose tissue involving adipogenesis, angiogenesis and extracellular matrix proteolysis. Studies using a nutritionally induced obesity model in transgenic mice support a role of the fibrinolytic (plasminogen\/plasmin) and matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) systems in these processes. Venous or arterial thrombosis models in obese mice confirm a prothrombotic risk associated with obesity.","744":null,"745":"Plasma levels of von Willebrand factor (VWF) are increased in patients with cardiovascular risk factors. Various studies aimed to elucidate the relation of VWF with thromboembolic cardiovascular events, ischaemic stroke as well as with peripheral arterial occlusive disease. In the general population, there is only a weak association between VWF levels and future cardiovascular events or stroke. In contrast, VWF levels are predictive in patients with documented vascular disease. Those patients with increased VWF suffer a higher incidence of major adverse cardiac events including death. The extent of the VWF release and its levels independently predict clinical outcome in patients with acute coronary syndromes. Elevated VWF levels have also been observed in patients with atrial fibrillation compared to controls and predict outcome. This may at least in part be attributable to the association of VWF with underlying cardiovascular risk factors. Hence, VWF correlates with Framingham and CHADS stroke risk stratification score and can be used as a marker in patients with AF. However, VWF is not only a predictor; it also plays a crucial role in thrombogenesis. This fact has made VWF a promising target for research into new antiplatelet therapies that specifically inhibit VWF. This review focuses on the role of VWF in ACS, ischaemic stroke and peripheral arterial disease and the relevance of therapeutic interventions targeting VWF for ACS patients.","746":"Platelet function testing is essential for the diagnosis of congenital\/acquired bleeding disorders and may be useful for the prediction of surgical bleeding. Nowadays there is also much interest in monitoring the efficacy of anti-platelet therapy and measuring platelet hyper-function. However, this often presents clinical laboratories with significant challenges as platelet function tests are complex, poorly standardized, time consuming and quality assurance is not straightforward. There are also few comprehensive modern guidelines available and many recent published surveys have revealed poor standardization between laboratories. Up until the late 1980's the traditional clinical platelet function tests that were available were the bleeding time (BT), light transmission (LTA) and whole blood aggregometry (WBA) and various biochemical assays. These were also usually performed within specialized research and clinical laboratories. Since the last BCSH guidelines were published in 1988 a variety of new platelet function tests have become available. These include flow cytometry and an ever increasing choice of new commercial instruments. Although the potential clinical utility of the new assays is emerging some have not yet entered into routine clinical practice. It is encouraging that a number of standardization committees (e. g. CLSI, BCSH and ISTH Platelet Physiology SSC) are now beginning to produce new platelet function testing guidelines and this will hopefully improve clinical practice, quality assurance and result in less variability between different laboratories.","747":"Blood platelets are the first line of defense against bleeding and as such involved in the haemostatic repair of damaged vasculature. Their true prowess seems to be displayed under high shear conditions where platelets interact with a variety of plasma proteins, all of which are tightly regulated to close the leak but at the same time prevent lumen occlusion and thromboembolism. The first task is to arrest fast flowing platelets on exposed collagen of the damaged subendothelial surface. Although platelets are endowed with several collagen receptors, most notably integrin alpha2bbeta1 and the immunoglobulin superfamily member GPVI, they can not arrest platelets at high shear rates. The latter requires binding of the platelet receptor GPIbalpha to the A1-binding domain of von Willebrand factor (VWF), which first has to be immobilized from the flowing blood onto the site of injury. Under high shear conditions further accrual of newly arriving platelets again requires VWF, which has to bridge platelets not only to the exposed collagen but also to each other by being sandwiched between the multiple platelet layers of the haemostatic plug.","748":"Von Willebrand factor (VWF) structure-function relationship has been studied only through in vitro approaches. The VWF-deficient mouse model has been extremely useful to examine the in vivo function of VWF but does not allow a more subtle analysis of the relative importance of its different domains. However, considering the large size of VWF and its capacity to interact with various ligands in order to support platelet adhesion and aggregation, the necessity to evaluate independently these interactions appeared increasingly crucial. A recently developed technique, known as hydrodynamic injection, which allows transient expression of a transgene by mouse hepatocytes, proved very useful in this regard. Indeed, transient expression of various VWF mutants in VWF-deficient mice contributed to improve our knowledge about the role of VWF interaction with subendothelial collagens and with platelets receptors in VWF roles in haemostasis and thrombosis. These findings can provide new leads in the development of anti-thrombotic therapies.","749":"Our studies involve computational simulations, a reconstructed plasma\/platelet proteome, whole blood in vitro and blood exuding from microvascular wounds. All studies indicate that in normal haemostasis, the binding of tissue factor (TF) with plasma factor (F) VIIa (extrinsic FXase complex) results in the initiation phase of the procoagulant response. This phase is negatively regulated by tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) in combination with antithrombin (AT) and the protein C (PC) pathway. The synergy between these inhibitors provides a threshold-limited reaction in which a stimulus of sufficient magnitude must be provided for continuation of the reaction. With sufficient stimulus, the FXa produced activates some prothrombin. This initial thrombin activates the procofactors and platelets required for presentation of the intrinsic FXase (FVIIIa-FIXa) and prothrombinase (FVa-FXa) complexes which drive the subsequent propagation phase; continuous downregulation of which is provided by AT and the thrombin-thrombomodulin-PC complex. FXa generation during the propagation phase is largely (&gt;90%) provided by the intrinsic FXase complex. TF is required for the initiation phase of the reaction but becomes non-essential once the propagation phase has been achieved. The propagation phase catalysts (FVIIIa-FIXa and FVa-FXa) continue to drive the reaction as blood is resupplied to the wound site by flow. Ultimately, the control of the reaction is governed by the pro- and anticoagulant dynamics and the supply of blood reactants to the site of a perforating injury. Our systems have been utilized to examine the qualities of hypothetical and novel antihaemorrhagic and anticoagulation agents and in epidemiologic studies of venous and arterial thrombosis and haemorrhagic pathology.","750":"The clinical link between cancer and thrombosis has been recognized by Armand Trousseau in 1865. It has now become clear that clotting activation in malignancy not only plays an important role in the evolution of venous thromboembolism (VTE) or systemic coagulation disorders such as disseminated intravascular coagulation, but that multiple components of the haemostatic and fibrinolytic systems are directly involved in tumour progression. In particular, tissue factor (TF) appears to be involved in several pathways relevant to cancer growth and metastasis. Increasing evidence emerges that haemostatic perturbances in cancer patients are, at least in part, controlled by defined genetic events in molecular tumourigenesis including activating and inactivating mutations of oncogenes and tumour suppressor genes, respectively. Long-term therapy with low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) is considered as standard treatment for cancer-associated VTE. However, several experimental studies and clinical trials suggest that LMWH may also be beneficial as an adjunct in the treatment of patients with malignant disease. This article provides an overview on the significance, pathogenesis and treatment of cancer-related clotting disorders as well as on the cellular and molecular mechanisms, by which haemostatic components such as TF, platelets and fibrin(ogen) drive tumour progression.","751":"As in adults, haemorrhagic or thrombotic events may also occur in children. The underlying reasons are inborn or acquired. Inherited disorders usually present during in early infancy. In order to interpret clinical and laboratory findings in children, it is necessary to keep in mind some specific paediatric features. This knowledge also forms the basic requirement to choose the appropriate therapy.","752":"Women with acquired and hereditary thrombophilia are at increased risk of developing venous thromboembolism and other associated gestational vascular complications like fetal loss, preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and placental abruption during pregnancy. These complications are a major cause of maternal and fetal morbidity and mortality. In view of the data showing an association between thrombophilia and these adverse pregnancy outcomes, clinicians are increasingly using antithrombotic therapy in women at risk of these complications. Aside from recurrent pregnancy loss in antiphospholipid syndrome and prevention of venous thromboembolism, there is limited evidence on the benefit of antithrombotic interventions to guide therapy. The data in favour of antithrombotic therapy in women with hereditable thrombophilia and vascular placental complications consist predominantly of small uncontrolled trials or observational studies. Randomized, placebo-controlled trials are lacking as most patients do not accept placebo. Further randomised controlled trials are urgently required to explore this therapeutic option.","753":"Managing perioperative haemostasis starts with the diligently taken patient history. Unfortunately, classic global tests such as the PT and aPTT have no predictive value with regard to an acquired intra- or postoperative bleeding diathesis. However, new assays for preoperative risk stratification are in clinical development. An attribute of good perioperative haemostasis management is the early, multidisciplinary problem assessment. With a preoperatively existing anticoagulation or antiplatelet therapy, perioperative bridging therapy needs to be carefully planned as cardiovascular risk patients have an increased risk of morbidity and mortality when their current anticoagulative therapy is simply stopped. If a haemorrhagic diathesis is known, a specific therapy should be scheduled early preoperatively. When excessive intra- and postoperative bleeding occurs, point of care diagnostics can help to determine the underlying pathophysiology. A predefined validated algorithm reduces the need for blood products. To establish an evidence based approach for the use of blood components and other procoagulants in such a situation requires prospective clinical trials. The actual knowledge on the pathophysiology of such incidents (e. g. cross linking defects by use of colloids, dilutional effects of volume therapy, repeated use of FFP, of antifibrinolytics, frequency of unwanted effects) should also be considered.","754":"The term acute coronary syndrome (ACS) pertains to the instable and life-threatening forms of a clinically manifest coronary artery disease with biochemical and\/or electro-cardiographic evidence of myocyte cell death. In detail, it includes the unstable angina pectoris, the non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) the ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and as well the sudden cardiac death. As early reperfusion of ischaemic myocardium is the most effective way for limiting infarct size by restoring the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, it is the most important therapeutic goal to achieve early and complete antegrade flow in the occluded or restricted vessel, related with a reduction of short and longtime complications as heart failure and severe arrhythmias. It is generally accepted, that the primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the method of choice in acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) to restore TIMI-3 blood flow in occluded coronary arteries, if this can be performed within two hours of symptom onset and by a highly specialized team. Since these requirements are only met in 20% of hospitals caring for patients with STEMI in Germany, the therapy with thrombolytic and anticoagulant agents plays still an important role. Apart from a rapid and effective prehospital primary care, it depends furthermore on a differentiated anticoagulatory and antithrombotic therapy during coronary intervention to get optimal results.","755":"Fibrinolytic therapy still is a keystone in the therapeutic approach of acute occlusion in different vascular regions. However, before starting fibrinolytic therapy an evidence-based risk assessment is necessary. This article presents the most common fibrinolytic agents as well as evidences and recommendations for fibrinolytic therapy of different vascular regions.","756":"A survey is given on pharmacology and indications for the treatment with vitamin K antagonists. The therapeutic handling and self control by the patient is described.","757":"For decades, the options for therapeutic anticoagulation were limited to unfractionated heparin (UFH) and vitamin K antagonists (VKA), and their well-known limitations had to be accepted. With the introduction of the various LMWHs, the short- and medium-term anticoagulation could be much improved, but an alternative to VKA is still missing The heparins provided the proof of concept that FXa and thrombin represent suitable targets for therapeutic anticoagulation. Consequently, the search for new anticoagulants focuses on inhibitors of thrombin (DTI) or FXa (DXI). Apart from the VKA, the anticoagulants presently available or in an advanced stage of development can thus be divided in two classes: One are the glyco-anticoagulants with the natural sulfated glycosaminoglycans (GAGs) (UFH, LMWHs, and danaparoid) and the synthetic oligosaccharides (OS) (fondaparinux, idraparinux, and SR123781A). The other class are the xenobiotic anticoagulants, i.e. proteins and synthetic chemical entities. Die glyco-anticoagulants act partially (GAGs) or exclusively (oligosaccharides) by catalysing antithrombin, whereas the xenobiotic anticoagulants are direct inhibitors of either thrombin or FXa. At present, three parenteral DTI (lepirudin, argatroban, and bivalirudin) and since March 2008 one oral DTI (dabigatran etexilate) are clinically used for limited indications. In September 2008 rivaroxaban has been approved as the first oral DXI. This review describes the development of the anticoagualants as well as the pharmacological profile of the clinically used anticoagualants.","758":"Topics of this survey are the indications and use of plasma-derived and recombinant coagulation factor concentrates. These substitution therapies need to be handled carefully by weighing up their effectiveness against the long and short term side effects in the individual patient.","759":"In the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis in ambulatory patients, the recommended initial steps are assessment of clinical probability (CP) and a sensitive D-dimer test. With a low CP and negative D-dimer, thrombosis can be ruled out. All other constellations require further investigation with imaging techniques. Compression ultrasonography is the first-line investigation. Low-molecular weight heparin or fondaparinux is the treatment of choice for uncomplicated venous thrombosis. Secondary prophylaxis with a vitamin K antagonist is introduced in parallel as quickly as possible. The duration of treatment depends on the exposure and predisposing factors, weighing carefully the risk of recurrence on the one hand against the risk of bleeding on the other. The danger of a post thrombotic syndrome is reduced by the immediate begin of a long lasting compression therapy.","760":"A survey on definitions, epidemiology, clinical manifestations of congenital and acquired thrombophilias is given with focus on evidence-based data. Diagnostic and therapeutical strategies are presented. Selective thrombophilia screening based on previous personal and\/or family history of venous thromboembolism is more cost-effective than universal screening in all patient groups. In the majority of patients with venous thrombosis the results of thrombophilia screening do not influence the duration of oral anticoagulation. The only patient population who clearly profits from thrombophilia screening in this situation are patients with a newly diagnosed antiphospholipid syndrome, because prolonged anticoagulation can avoid the high incidence of recurrence in this patient population. Because of the increased risk of venous thrombosis during pregnancy and the puerperium, thrombophilia screening is indicated in selected patients with a previous history of venous thrombosis to be able to decide whether anticoagulation is necessary when these patients become pregnant. Significant associations with early and late pregnancy loss are observed for patients with thrombophilia while it remains unknown whether these patients profit from anticoagulation with heparin or low dose aspirin during their next pregnancy since placebo-controlled multicenter trials are not yet available.","761":"Thrombotic microangiopathies are disorders of microvascular occlusion and are characterized by thrombocytopenia and microangiopathic haemolytic anaemia. Varying additional signs and symptoms of organ ischaemia may be present. Thrombotic microangiopathies are pathophysiologically heterogenous disorders and include primarily thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura and haemolytic uraemic syndrome. Besides this, they may occur in association with certain diseases or drugs, or after allogeneic haematopoietic stem cell transplantation.","762":"Acquired coagulopathies regularly result from underlying diseases such as liver failure or sepsis. Optimal treatment of these underlying diseases defines longterm prognosis. In a few coagulopathies, such as immunocoagulopathies, in a relevant portion of patients an underlying disease cannot be identified. Therapeutic modulation of haemostasis aiming at the prevention of fatal bleeding or thromboembolism is able to improve the prognosis of patients with acquired coagulopathies. Most often this is the result of individualized, lab-controlled treatments, which are difficult to study. Within the last years the role of therapeutic modulation of haemostasis to reduce mortality was successfully studied for the first time in the frame of randomized placebo-controlled phase III studies.","763":"An overview is given on the clinical picture and therapy of the haemophilias A and B as an example for congenital coagulopathies. The survey deals with the special problems of today's \"treated haemophilia\" and its recommendations on diagnosis and treatment regimens. A special focus is put on the pathogenesis of the haemophilic joint arthropathy, that is affecting most haemophiliacs earlier or later during life. Safe plasma derived and recombinant clotting factor concentrates allow an efficient on-demand and also a prophylactic treatment for the prevention of bleeding sequelae. As a consequence life quality and life expectancy of today born haemophiliacs have nearly normalised. The problems of haemophilia with inhibitors and future therapeutic options are discussed. The development of inhibitors at start of therapy with factor VIII concentrates represent the nowadays most serious complication of haemophilia treatment. The only way to a long lasting eradication of the inhibitor ist the induction of immune tolerance that can be achieved by various protocols. A successful immune tolerance therapy (ITT) is the precondition for a regular prophylactic treatment regime. The Guidelines of the Federal Chamber of Physicians, the German recommendations for ITT and the consensus recommendations of an international working group provide an important lead for the conduction of immune tolerance therapy.","764":"A survey is given on the peculiar characteristics of laboratory methods for analyzing the blood coagulation system with special regard to the preanalytical, analytical and postanalytical phase. Routinely used methods are described.","765":"Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is known for its marked heterogeneity which was already recognized by von Willebrand in 1926. The basis of phenotypic differentiation are quantitative and qualitative or functional differences between the different types and subtypes of VWD. Clinical relevant facts for the practioner on diagnosis and therapy of von Willebrand disease and von Willebrand syndrome are presented.","766":"Given the high consumption of pharmacological agents in western societies, it is not surprising at all that drugs represent the most common cause of acquired platelet dysfunction. While acetylsalicylic acid, clopigogrel and integrin alphaIIbbeta3 (GPIIb-IIIa) receptor antagonists are well-known as prototypes of antiplatelet drugs, other widely used agents including non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, antibiotics, serotonin reuptake inhibitors, and volume expanders can also impair platelet function and cause or aggravate haemorrhages. Besides pharmacological agents, certain clinical conditions are often associated with qualitative platelet disorders and bleeding diathesis. Consequently, in contrast to inherited platelet disorders, acquired platelet function defects are much more frequent in clinical practice and deserve special attention. Their pathogenesis is widespread and heterogeneous with various, sometimes overlapping abnormalities. Moreover, acquired platelet dysfunctions can occur at any age and range in severity from mild to life-threatening haemorrhages. Due to their heterogeneity, acquired platelet function disorders will be classified and discussed according to the underlying clinical setting or disease.","767":"This article reviews the roles of blood platelets in haemostasis as well as in the pathogenesis of thromboembolic diseases. Besides the basic processes in primary haemostasis, platelet adhesion, platelet secretion, platelet aggregation, clot retraction, the new model of thrombin formation on the platelet surface is presented. The different signal transduction pathways in platelets are a main focus of this review.","768":"Molecular biological methods have become increasingly important not only in the diagnostics of inherited monogenetic diseases such as hemophilia A or B but also in the diagnostics of polygenetic diseases e.g. venous and arterial thrombosis. In haemophilia A, sequencing of the factor VIII gene has been established in addition to the analysis of the two most frequent genetic abnormalities, the inversions in intron 22 and intron 1, in several centers. Molecular testing has proved helpful to identify haemophilia patients at high risk to develop inhibitors as well as in carrier analysis. In patients with familial protein C or protein S deficiency mutation analysis contributes to the verification of the diagnosis. The frequently performed tests for the factor V Leiden mutation and the prothrombin 20210G&gt;A variation can potentially support the estimation of the thrombotic risk as well as the risk of recurrence. However, any uncritical application of these genetic tests does not improve diagnostics nor does it support therapeutic decision making or counselling of the patient. Therefore, one should only do genetic tests with medical or therapeutic consequences. The applicability of mutation analysis in the daily routine is still limited in spite of the importance of molecular diagnostics in the understanding of pathomechanisms of haemostatic disorders. As has been demonstrated in large studies, the phenotypic effects of mutations can vary significantly between individuals. Endogenous and exogenous modulators that are still largely unknown, play a role. Currently, the understanding of these modulators is limited, and large multicenter studies and meta-analyses are needed for a better understanding of gene-gene and gene-environment interactions.","769":"The principles of initiator and amplifications reactions of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis will be presented and discussed in relation to various regulatory pathways of haemostasis. In particular, cell surface-dependent activation and inhibition reactions are characteristics of multicomponent enzyme complexes that also allow the endogenous control of the haemostasis system. The understanding of these relationships in complications of haemostasis has lead to different strategies for the therapeutic intervention with pro- and anticoagulant substances.","770":"","771":"Safety issues concerning the risk of malignancy formation and immune response to viral vectors were raised in initial gene therapy trials. In contrast, non-viral gene delivery methods have long been offside. We therefore explore a non-viral gene transfer approach for the treatment of hemophilia B. First, we constructed a strong liver-specific expression plasmid for human factor IX (FIX). Next, we tested the vector by injecting two doses under hydrodynamic conditions into the tail veins of FIX knockout mice. A single injection resulted in an increase in FIX expression over 100% of normal plasma levels. The FIX resulted fully functional. Further, no anti-FIX antibodies were observed and expression levels were vector dose dependent. The high expression obtained in small animals give hope for further development of non-viral gene transfer for the treatment of hemophilia B in humans. ","772":"RFVIIa-enhanced thrombin generation has been shown to be dependent on platelets. In previous work we have shown that addition of monocytes and rFVIIa to microparticle free plasma causes a distinct thrombin generation. The aim of our study has been to examine whether there is enough surface provided by microparticles in thrombocytopenic plasma to allow an effect of rFVIIa. Thrombin generation was measured in platelet rich plasma (PRP) and microparticle free plasma (MFP) of thrombocytopenic haemato-oncological patients with and without addition of rVIIa by means of calibrated automated thrombography. Microparticles were analyzed in PRP by FACS flow cytometry. Microparticle free plasma showed no thrombin generation with or without addition of rFVIIa. Addition of rFVIIa to PRP of thrombocytopenic patients led to a significant shortening of lag time and time to peak in thrombin generation, while ETP and peak remained unchanged. Our results show that even in plasma of severe thrombocytopenic patients enough surface may be provided by microparticles to allow an enhancement of thrombin generation by rFVIIa. ","773":"The development of apheresis technology has increased efficiency in donor blood use by collecting specific blood components in several combinations. The question of donor safety raised by the contact of donor blood with foreign, only in part biocompatible surfaces remains. The aim of this study was to estimate the effect of multicomponent blood collection on thrombin generation performing an overall function test of coagulation. 26 blood donors were included. Per apheresis two units of platelets and one unit of RBCs were collected by two cell separators (Amicus and Trima Accel). Each donor underwent the procedure on both apheresis systems. Samples were collected before, immediately after, and 48 hours after apheresis. Thrombin generation was measured by means of calibrated automated thrombography (CAT). CAT-data changed only slightly and no significant changes were seen before, immediately after, and 48 hours after apheresis. The parameters did not differ significantly between the two different apheresis devices. No change in parameters of continuous thrombin generation occurred, suggesting that apheresis did not lead to severe alterations in the haemostatic system. ","774":"Thrombin generation was studied in paediatric patients with congenital heart disease (CHD) undergoing cardiac surgery using the calibrated automated thrombography (CAT) in terms of the lag time until the onset of thrombin formation, time to thrombin peak maximum (TTP), endogenous thrombin potential (ETP), and thrombin peak height. The suitability to determine the coagulation status of these patients was investigated. CAT data of 40 patients with CHD (age range from newborn to 18 years) were compared to data using standard coagulation parameters such as prothrombin (FII), antithrombin (AT), tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), prothrombin fragment 1.2 (F 1.2), thrombin-antithrombin (TAT), activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and prothrombin time (PT). A significant positive correlation was seen between ETP and FII (p &lt; 0.01; r = 0.369), as well as between peak height and FII (p &lt; 0.01; r = 0.483). A significant negative correlation was seen between ETP and TFPI values (p &lt; 0.05; r = -0.225) while no significant correlation was seen between peak height and TFPI. A significant negative correlation was seen between F 1.2 generation and ETP (p &lt; 0.05; r = -0.254) and between F 1.2 generation and peak height (p &lt; 0.05; r = -0.236). No correlation was seen between AT and ETP or peak. CAT is a good global test reflecting procoagulatory and inhibitory factors of the haemostatic system in paediatric patients with CHD. ","775":"In Germany a recommendation was introduced by experts from several medical associations concerning the renunciation of preoperative coagulation diagnostics in ENT interventions in children with inconspicuous bleeding history and published in July 2006. In August 2007 a survey concerning the implementation of this recommendation was sent to all pediatricians and ENT doctors working in medical offices in Dresden. The survey was answered by 23 (49%) paediatricians out of 47 who were contacted and 8 (33%) out of 24 ENT doctors. Fifteen pediatricians (65%) and 3 ENT doctors (38%) have implemented the recommendation consequently and 6 respectively 3 occasionally. Only 2 pediatricians and 2 ENT doctors did not accept the recommendation. Four paediatricians and 4 ENT doctors expressed their concerns with the implementation of recommendation. Since the implementation of this recommendation 3 children suffered from bleeding complications in ambulant ENT operations but in no case a coagulation disorder was present. The implementation of the recommendation at the regional level is practicable. Its acceptance is obviously higher in paediatricians than in ENT doctors. ","776":"Clinical expression of inadequately treated haemophilia is dominated by orthopedic complications, requiring invasive or non-invasive interventions. In Romania, with under dosed and late introduced \"on demand\" substitution, we aimed at highlighting the experience of orthopedic treatment and its outcome. Single center retrospective analysis regarding orthopedic interventions and their outcomes was conducted on 59 hemophilia A, B, and von Willebrand disease patients, between 2002 and 2007. The majority of interventions, invasive (60.71%) and non-invasive (39.28%), were elective, only two being emergencies. Postoperative functional evolution after synovectomies was good in 68.28%, fair in 24.39%, satisfactory in 7.31%. Results of 33 non-invasive (extensive releases) procedures were very good in 27.27%, good in 63.63%, poor in 9.09%. The important number and complexity of orthopedic interventions are proving the precarious musculoskeletal state in persons with hemophilia, demonstrating the need of improving substitution, at least with discontinue prophylaxis in patients with severe forms. ","777":"A literature research for back pain in hemophilia (1990-2007) revealed only five papers! They all had lumbar or sciatic pain due to hematoma. All symptoms responded to factor VIII replacement. A similar research for a normal population showed hundreds of papers with a lifetime prevalence of 80% for back pain. A survey of 49 patient with hemophilia showed similar results. 70% had experienced back pain before. The reported pain of 40 to 70 on a visual analog scale was significant. 40% reported that the back pain would be more limiting than the pain associated with hemophilia. The hemophilic patient has learned to cope! The treatment of back pain will be of growing importance for hemophilia centers while the typical complaints of hemophilic symptoms will decrease due to better treatment protocols.","778":"Since 1983 (survey period returning to 1978) with support of numerous haemophilia treating centres of any size an annual survey regarding the epidemiology of patients suffering of haemophilia is performed. The actual compilation is resting upon a broad database returning to almost 30 years of inquiry well representing both the actual and retrospective status of mortality. Prompted was exclusively information about patients with haemophilia A, B and von Willebrand disease. In particular anonymous data concerning the last 12 months about number of treated patients, type and severity of illness, HIV-status and detailed information about causes of death was inquired. This data was merged with existing data and analyzed statistically. In the 2006\/2007 survey, a total number of 8188 patients with bleeding disorders have been reported from 69 participating centres. Despite mortality from HIV in patients with haemophilia is decreasing, HIV still remains an important factor as a HIV\/HCV coinfection seems to increase risk of progression of liver disease. Age structure in our patients has been shifting significantly over the last decades bringing age distribution into line with the entire population. This has to be considered in assessing mortality and morbidity.","779":"Acute compartment syndrome is a complication in which microcirculation is impaired due to increased tissue pressure within a confined (osteo-fibrous) space and leads to neuromuscular dysfunction. A serious complication of haemophilia is the development of inhibitors. In this case the immune system produces antibodies to factor VIII or IX during substitution therapy of haemophilia A or B. These antibodies are directed against both, the substituted and the endogenous factors. A man (age: 81 years) with originally moderate haemophilia A who at the age of 63 developed an inhibitor during treatment of a bleeding event. Painful swelling in the left forearm occurred without any recollection of trauma, and failed to subside under factor substitution initially performed by the patient. This finding necessitated emergency fasciotomy of the forearm flexor compartment. In order to keep the complication rate as low as possible in the presence of hemophilia with inhibitors, the patients should only be treated in a specially equipped interdisciplinary treatment center. ","780":"The endoprosthetic surgery of the upper ankle joint in profound arthrosis has significantly increased over the last years. Along with the established arthodesis the alloarthroplastic became a good alternative. The main indication for the implantation of an ankle joint endoprosthesis is a secondary arthrosis in patients with rheumatic diseases or post-traumatic status. In accordance with our experience case reports on the total ankle arthroplasty in haemophilic arthropathy show that the artificial substitute of the upper ankle joint can be a successful treatment of these patients under certain conditions. The outstanding benefit is to be seen in the preservation of a sufficient mobility for everyday movements and a more physiological process of walking. In case of endoprosthetic failure a relatively save opportunity for revision in the mostly younger patients can be found in the new osteosynthesis techniques. Also in haemophilic arthropathy with painful advanced arthrosis and functional limitation of the upper ankle joint the endoprosthetic care can be taken into consideration.","781":"The development of inhibitors is one of the most important complications of replacement therapy in haemophilia, affecting mortality and morbidity. Inhibitor development is based on complex immunological factors. Cytokines and their receptors, T-cell receptors, and the Major Histocompatibility Complex may play important roles in the development of inhibitors. Earlier studies showed non significant associations between HLA class and inhibitor development. Later studies found an increased risk of inhibitor development if there was a combination between certain factor VIII mutations and HLA antigens. We performed HLA typing in 50 patients with haemophilia A in an effort to find associations with inhibitor development. 25 patients had developed an inhibitor (11 low titre, 14 high titre), and 25 never had. In logistic regression analysis, HLA-A 34, DRB1 0405, DRB1 1301 seemed to be involved in inhibitor development and HLA-A 30, B 13, B15, B 57, Cw 12, DQB1 0303, DPB1 0201 protection against inhibitor development. In our patients, the HLA-associations with inhibitor development were different from those in previous publications. ","782":"The development of inhibitors at start of therapy with factor VIII concentrates represent the most serious complication of haemophilia treatment. The only way to a long lasting eradication of the inhibitor is the induction of immune tolerance. A successful immune tolerance therapy (ITT) is the precondition for a regular prophylactic treatment regime and subsequently safe life perspective with a good quality of life. All ITT protocols have been developed empirically without knowing the pathophysiological mechanisms. The guidelines of the Federal Chamber of Physicians (1), the German recommendations for ITT (2) and the consensus recommendations of an international working group (3) provide an important lead for the conduction of immune tolerance therapy.","783":"Through the GMG (modified law of health system) the section sign 116b \"out-patients department\" was newly introduced into the SGB V (5(th) social welfare legislation) in 2004. Thus, the health insurance companies had the possibility to come to an agreement with hospitals concerning rare illnesses such as haemophilia. On this basis a care agreement was agreed upon in 2005 between the University Hospital Eppendorf (Hamburg) and three big health insurance companies. The result leads to positive changes for all concerned: The patients were offered an optimal care through the link to the CCC and this with an adequate compensation for the coagulation section for out-patients. As the therapy programme became more clarified, the communication between the parties involved became more constructive. With the law to strengthen competition (WSG) for the insurance companies, a change of section sign 116b of the SGB V (5(th) social welfare legislation) came into force in 2007. Thus the legal basis for the a. m. agreement was withdrawn. It is now the task of the a. m. parties to find a way to secure the advantages obtained through this agreement, to the benefit of the patients, the coagulation sections for out-patients and the cost bearers.","784":null,"785":"Interventional radiology has an increasing spectrum of indications, in particular, for vascular medical problems. By Seldinger's puncture via the right femoral artery, an aneurysm of the right common iliac artery stump was sufficiently excluded with coil embolization. As a complication, an iatrogenic bleeding at the aneurysmatic neck was effectively stopped after the first interventional step with injection of an occlusion emulsion according to the bleeding site. Image-guided interventional measures in radiology allow a minimal invasive approach in a former classical field of vascular surgery. Furthermore, procedure-related complications can be increasingly controlled.","786":"Nearly every second patient, who needs an oral anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists, is feasible to perform INR-self-management after participation in a structured teaching program. Patient self-testing or measuring the INR value by relatives or nurses would increase this method of control by the aid of telemedicine systems. An accurately, weekly measurement leads to an optimal therapeutic control of anticoagulation intensity, which results in an impressive risk reduction up to 50%. This depends not on the underlying heart disease and had been demonstrated in patients older than 60 years. Due to the small INR variability and therefore a higher percentage in target range, a lower anticoagulation intensity in patients with mechanical heart valve prosthesis should be justifiable. For the next decade, INR self-management\/self-testing should be the method of choice, even direct thrombin inhibitors or factor Xa antagonists would be available. An advantage of INR self-management is the control of drug adherence, which could be an unresolved problem for new anticoagulants.","787":"In pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH), thrombosis and thromboembolism occurs as a consequence of pulmonary microvasculopathy with a change of pulmonary vascular microenviroment toward a procoagulant, prothrombotic and antifibrinolytic pattern. Circulating antiphospholipid antibodies, increased plasma levels of platelet aggregating agents (serotonin, thromboxane), adhesion molecules (P selectin, von Willebrand factor), antifibrinolytic enzymes (plasminogen activator inhibitor 1) and prothrombotic cytokines have been identified in PAH patients so far. Thrombogenic pulmonary vasculopathy has been documented in many patients with PAH. Furthermore, most patients will not be diagnosed until right heart enlargement and impaired right ventricular function has developed. Thus, there is clear rationale for a treatment with anticoagulation. In four uncontrolled studies Warfarin improved the prognosis of patients with idiopathic and other forms of PAH. However, so far there are no prospective randomised studies evaluating the role of anticoagulants in the treatment of PAH. This review summarizes the current data and guidelines concerning anticoagulation in PAH.","788":"Most hospitalized patients present risk factors for venous thromboembolism (VTE). Deep vein thrombosis and pulmonary embolism are relevant causes for morbidity and mortality in the perihospital phase, with a possibly fatal outcome. Surgical as well as nonsurgical patients with acute medical illness are at risk and show comparatively high rates of VTE. Because of this, an effective and safe prophylaxis for hospitalized patients is necessary. Definition of different risk categories and treatment of patients according to the individual risk profile is standard in VTE prophylaxis. For VTE prophylaxis various medical and mechanical options are available.","789":"In this overview the actual guideline-recommendations for anticoagulation in atrial fibrillation and the problems of the currently available therapy are discussed. Furthermore an outlook over future developments in this field is given. Effective anticoagulation can prohibit thrombembolic events and is thus essential for the prognosis of patients suffering from atrial fibrillation. Until now vitamin-K-antagonists (VKAs) and acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) are available for oral anticoagulation in these patients. VKAs demonstrate a satisfying efficiency combined with rather high bleeding hazard. ASA on the other hand allows only moderate risk reduction with minimal side effects. Thus the guidelines recommend anticoagulation tailored to the individual risk, which can be evaluated by the CHADS2-Score. New therapeutic strategies, like the factor Xa inhibitor rivaroxaban or the factor II inhibitor dabigatran, are actually evaluated in phase III studies. These drugs bear the hope of higher efficiency combined with improved safety and much more comfortable use in the daily practice (e. g. no need for INR measurement, no dose adaptation).","790":"Atrial fibrillation (AF) is the commonest sustained cardiac arrhythmia, which confers a high risk of mortality and morbidity from stroke and thromboembolism. The precise mechanisms by which AF causes thromboembolism and subsequent cerebrovascular events have attracted much research interest, and are yet to be fully elucidated. Nonetheless, it is well recognised that AF fulfils Virchow's triad for thrombogenesis, with abnormal flow conditions with loss of atrial contractility and an irregularly irregular cardiac output, (i. e. flow abnormalities), as well as structural heart disease with endocardial damage (i. e. abnormal vessel wall) and abnormalities in platelet and haemostatic variables (i. e. abnormal blood constituents). This review is to summarise the evidence so far for the role of coagulation and fibrinolytic components, platelets and inflammation (that is blood constituents) in the generation of the prothrombotic state in AF, with particular focus on the endothelium and AF.","791":"Microparticles (MP) are small cell vesicles that are released by activated or apoptotic cells and that are amenable to quantification in peripheral blood. MP consist of the cytoplasm and the cell membrane of their cell of origin, which allows for their assignment to these cells. By the detection of the respected MP one can conclude to the functional status of the cell of origin. It is known that MP confer specific information between cells and contribute to inflammatory and coagulatory processes. They are detectable in many acute and chronic vascular diseases as a surrogate marker for disease activity but also play a role in the pathophysiology of vascular diseases.","792":"The stimulation of the endogenous adaptive vessel growth (angiogenesis, arteriogenesis) provides a promising therapeutic approach for the large number of patients with vascular occlusive disease that is not eligible for current interventional treatments. Despite the proven efficacy of various factors in pre-clinical experimental studies, the successful translation of angiogenic therapies into clinical practice yet remains to be made. Most authors identified the mode of administrations as culprit for the neutral effects observed in the majority of clinical trials. Although experimental studies have proven the superiority of continuous intra-arterial application above other routes (iv, im, sc), clinical trials focused on either bolus therapy, iv or sc application respectively, due to the lack of technical solutions to fulfill the requirements of intra-arterial delivery. The recent developments in the field of drug eluting stents may offer new possibilities for local drug delivery. Local release of cytokines, such as TGF-beta, has been shown to induce collateral growth in an experimental model of PAD. Other factors might eventually render useful to stabilize atherosclerotic plaques downstream of the site of stent implantation.","793":"The formation of vasculature is a key step during embryogenesis. The vasculature and the intravascular blood compartment, which uses the former as a means of transportation, develop in a close spatial and temporal relationship. This review discusses the role of the blood coagulation system, particularly thrombin, as a tool to coordinate blood vessel formation. Mouse models indicate that a lack of coagulation factors results in impaired thrombin generation and consequently display a phenotype of disturbed cardiovascular development. Similar phenotypes are present in mouse models of impaired thrombin binding to its cellular receptor PAR1 or of disrupted signaling via G-proteins. Moreover, there is compelling evidence that thrombin signaling in vascular development cannot be explained by a model based only on the classical extrinsic and intrinsic coagulation pathways. As angiogenesis in adults follows the same signaling patterns as in embryos, it is of importance to learn about these pathways, hoping that they may serve as therapeutic targets in cardiovascular disease.","794":"","795":null,"796":"The diagnosis of antiphospholipid syndrome is based on clinical symptoms and is verified by laboratory testing. The spectrum of clinical symptoms includes not only arterial or venous thrombosis, a variety of neurological manifestations as well as pregnancy associated complications have been defined as relevant for the diagnosis. This article discusses the complexity of laboratory testing, problems of its standardisation and interpretation of test results. Progress and limitations of laboratory analysis are compared and the clinician will learn to read lab results with caution.","797":"For thrombophilia should be screened, if a first thromboembolic event has occurred at the age of less than 45 years, if family history indicates thrombophilia, or in the case of a special clinical condition. To get valid diagnostic results a few pecularities concerning the physiology of coagulation and laboratory medicine have to be considered. This review gives an overview of pitfalls and options during the preanalytical phase of thrombophilia diagnostics. Furthermore, the laboratory assays to perform a screening are highlighted.","798":"In recent years thrombophilia has gained much attention as a risk factor for pregnancy complications. Whereas there is an established correlation between antiphospholipid-antibodies and pregnancy loss, data for other risk factors of thrombosis are less well established. Data suggest associations with antithrombin deficiency, hyperhomocysteinemia and also with factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A variation and protein S-deficiency. The association of thrombophilia with pre-eclampsia is still under discussion. A limited number of prospective studies did not reveal an increased risk for pregnancy complications in unselected women with thrombosis risk factors. In a single study low molecular weight heparin seemed to have a positive effect on pregnancy outcome after previous single or recurrent abortions. Experience in prevention of pre-eclampsia by administration of prophylactic heparin is very limited. Data on pregnancy complications in women with known heritable thrombophilia or a history of thrombosis are inconsistent as well. These women usually have a favourable pregnancy outcome. Thrombophilia screening might be justified in women with pregnancy loss. Treatment with low molecular weight heparin might be considered for those with pregnancy loss and thrombophilia. Further prospective studies and controlled interventional trials are urgently needed. ","799":"Thrombophilic risk factors of the vascular system are not as well defined as the classic risk factors of atherosclerosis or the thrombophilic risk factors of the venous system. Until now, the assessment is complicated by an inadequate differentiation between (a) proatherosclerotic and prothrombogenic effects (i. e. platelet receptor polymorphisms) and (b) reactive alterations of a haemostatic parameter (i. e. PAI-1, Fibrinogen) as an expression of an acute phase reaction and primary hereditary changes of those risk determinants. Actual data indicate for the majority of the potential risk factors only a mildly increased relative risk for an arterial ischaemic event and are often inconsistent. Anyhow, the impact of potential thrombophilic risk factors for the arterial vascular occlusion is not excluded. A possible reason is, that conventional case-control studies cannot identify risk factors of thrombogenicity in the arterial system unless they are also risk factors of atherosclerosis.","800":"Whereas every clinician agrees on the need for anticoagulation initially after the diagnosis of venous thromboembolism (VTE), the opinions regarding optimal duration of secondary prophylaxis differ. The decision is complicated by the large number of identified risk factors associated with the risk of recurrence. In addition consideration has to be taken to the risk factors for bleeding and individual patient preferences. Data from long-term follow-up studies up to a decade indicate that some risk factors for recurrence decline and others seem to gain importance with time. In this review data has been extracted from the most illustrative trials to highlight controversies but also where there is consensus in order to give the clinician some support for the individual decisions on extension of anticoagulation after VTE.","801":"Venous thrombosis is a major medical problem annually affecting millions of individuals worldwide. It is a typical multifactorial disease, the pathogenesis involving both environmental and genetic risk factors. A single point mutation in the gene of coagulation factor V (FV), which results in the replacement of Arg506 with a Gln (FV Leiden) is the most common genetic risk factor known to date. The anticoagulant activated protein C (APC) regulates the activity of FVa by cleaving several sites in FVa, and the Arg506 is one of them. APC resistance, which is the consequence of the FV Arg506Gln mutation, results a lifelong hypercoagulable state that increases the risk of thrombosis. APC resistance was discovered in my laboratory and the first paper was published in 1993. This was the starting point for an avalanche of research in many laboratories and several thousands of articles have been published since on this topic. The medical community amazingly quickly accepted the concept of APC resistance\/FV Leiden as a major risk factor for thrombosis and millions of individuals are today tested for this condition. This review is a personal historical annotation about the early days of APC resistance.","802":"","803":"Epidemiological studies indicate that the consumption of soy-containing food may prevent or slow-down the development of cardiovascular disease. In endothelial cells application of a soy extract or a combination of the most abundant soy isoflavones genistein and daidzein both inhibited apoptosis, a driving force in atherosclerosis development, when applied in combination with oxidized LDL or homocysteine. Proteome analysis revealed that the stressor-induced alteration of protein expression profile was reversed by the soy extract or the genistein\/daidzein mixture. Only few protein entities that could be functionally linked to mitochondrial dysfunction were regulated in common by both application forms of isoflavones. A dietary intervention with isoflavone-enriched soy extract in postmenopausal women, who generally show strongly increased cardiovascular risk due to diminished estrogen production, led to significant alterations in the steady state levels of proteins from mononuclear blood cells. The proteins identified by proteome analysis revealed that soy isoflavones may increase the anti-inflammatory response in blood mononuclear cells thereby contributing to the atherosclerosis-preventive activities of a soy-rich diet. By proteome analysis protein targets were identified in vitro in endothelial cells that respond to soy isoflavones and that may decipher molecular mechanisms through which soy products exert their protective effects in the vasculature. ","804":"Pathogenesis of viral haemorrhagic fever (VHF) is closely associated with alterations of the vascular system. Among the virus families causing VHF, filoviruses (Marburg and Ebola) are the most fatal, and will be focused on here. After entering the body, Ebola primarily targets monocytes\/macrophages and dendritic cells. Infected dendritic cells are largely impaired in their activation potency, likely contributing to the immune suppression that occurs during filovirus infection. Monocytes\/macrophages, however, immediately activate after viral contact and release reasonable amounts of cytokines that target the vascular system, particularly the endothelial cells. Some underlying molecular mechanisms such as alteration of the vascular endothelial cadherin\/catenin complex, tyrosine phosphorylation, expression of cell adhesion molecules, tissue factor and the effect of soluble viral proteins released from infected cells to the blood stream will be discussed.","805":"Idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP) has an incidence of 5.8-6.6 per 100,000 adults and represents a frequent cause of impaired cellular haemostasis in clinical practice. Its diagnosis is still one of exclusion, because the diagnostic value of proposed biological markers of the disease has been disputed. The potential contribution of biomarkers both of the autoimmune reaction (leptin, free and cell-bound anti-platelet autoantibodies, specific B cells) and of thrombopoiesis (bone marrow histology, thrombopoietin, glycocalicin, reticulated platelets) to the diagnosis of ITP will be discussed. There is evidence that some of these biomarkers indeed could be useful in the diagnosis of ITP. To cope with the rapid progress in ITP therapy, prospective studies on well characterized cohorts are necessary to allow an efficient and definite diagnosis of this disease.","806":"Based on the concept that the so-called resistance to anti-platelet drugs is meant to describe a phenomenon where the drug does not hit its direct pharmacodynamic target, assays, used to evaluated the effects of anti-platelet drugs, should as closely as possible measure the direct pharmacodynamic effect of a particular drug. Thus, for the detection of aspirin effects, thromboxane concentrations or arachidonic acid-induced responses (light aggregometry, whole-blood aggregometry) should be measured. For the detection of clopidogrel actions, VASP phosphorylation (flow cytometry) or ADP-induced responses (light aggregometry, whole blood aggregometry) should be analysed.","807":"The acute coronary syndrome (ACS) is one of the most frequent diagnoses in cardiology. The therapeutic corner-stones of ACS are PCI (percutaneous coronary intervention) and inhibition of blood coagulation. Current antiplatelet therapy consists of aspirin in combination with clopidogrel and glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa blockade if needed. Prasugel is a new antiplatelet agent that is in the process of being approved for routine clinical use. In terms of antithrombotic therapy latest developments focus on drugs with anti-factor Xa activity, such as fondaparinux, or direct anti-thrombin activity, such as bivalirudin. This review discusses latest developments in the field of anti-platelet and anti-thrombotic therapy for ACS.","808":"For several decades, anticoagulants based on glycosaminoglycans (GAG) are drugs of choice in the therapy and prophylaxis of thromboembolic diseases. In principle, it has to be differentiated between the natural GAG-anticoagulants, which are molecular mixtures with complex composition, and the synthetic GAG-anticoagulants, which are chemically defined oligosaccharides. The former include unfractionated heparin, the various low molecular weight heparins and danaparoid. Representatives of the second group are fondaparinux, idraparinux and the hexadecasaccharide SR123781A. They share a common mechanism of action together with the endogenous antithrombotic heparan sulfate, i.e. the catalysis of the antithrombin-mediated inhibition of factor Xa. Besides, considerable structural differences between the various GAG-anticoagulants result in rather distinct product characteristics. This concerns their pharmacodynamics, pharmacokinetics as well as practice-related aspects such as dosage, monitoring, accumulation tendency, antagonisation and HIT-Typ II.","809":"The recent identification of vitamin K epoxid-reductase complex (VKORC1) contributed significantly to our mechanistic understanding of the vitamin K cycle. VKORC1 protein is targeted by Coumarins. Its enzymatic activity represents the rate-limiting step in the vitamin K cycle and gamma-carboxylation of vitamin K dependent proteins. Possibly, VKORC1 is the only component of VKOR activity. Mutations as well as polymorphisms in coding and non-coding regions of the VKORC1 gene have been shown to cause both partial to total coumarin resistance and coumarin sensitivity. Availability of molecular diagnostics (VKORC1, CYP2C9) and laboratory analysis by HPLC (determination of coumarin, vitamin K and vitamin K epoxide levels) is helpful in detection of hereditary and acquired factors influencing coumarin therapy. In the future, these tools might lead to an individualized and safer oral anticoagulation therapy. Furthermore, daily low-dose vitamin K supplementation may improve stability of coumarin-based anticoagulation. In the perspective of the coming new oral anticoagulants, the efficacy and safety profile of the \"old\" anticoagulants is of major importance. The well established and oeconomic coumarin drugs will benefit from a pharmacogenetic and nutritive adjusted optimization of therapy.","810":"The underlying disorder of pulmonary embolism (PE) is venous thromboembolism (VTE), comprising deep vein thrombosis, thrombus in transit, acute pulmonary embolism and chronic thromboembolic pulmonary hypertension (CTEPH). PE may recur and cause serious long-term complications, such as post-thrombotic syndrome and CTEPH. This short overview summarizes current concepts on pathophysiology, epidemiology, diagnosis and treatment of this common disorder.","811":"Venous thromboembolism is a chronic and potential fatal disease. Determination of recurrence risk is time-consuming and costly, and sometimes not feasible: many patients carry more than one risk factor, the relevance of some factors with regard to risk of recurrence is unknown, and existence of thus far unknown risk factors must be considered. A laboratory assay that measures multifactorial thrombophilia would be useful to identify patients at risk of thrombosis. The process of thrombin generation is the central event of the hemostatic process. Thrombin generation is increased in patients at risk of thrombosis including those with antithrombin deficiency or those who are taking hormonal contraceptives. Risk of first and recurrent venous thrombosis is higher in patients with increased thrombin generation. Thus, by use of a simple global marker of coagulation stratification of patients according to their risk of thrombosis is possible. Future studies are needed to improve the management of patients with VTE and increased thrombin generation.","812":"Elevated procoagulant and suppressed fibrinolytic activities are regularly encountered in different forms of clinical and experimental fibrosis of the lungs and the kidneys. Although primarily serving to provide a provisional matrix of repair largely consisting of fibrin and fibronectin, the involved procoagulant serine proteases and protease inhibitors may also exert distinct cellular downstream signaling events modifying the fibrotic response. In this review, evidence for an impaired regulation of coagulation and fibrinolysis factors in clinical and experimental lung and renal fibrosis is provided and the role of PAR (protease activated receptor) induced profibrotic and HGF (hepatocyte growth factor) elicited antifibrotic cellular events is worked out. In view of experiments obtained in animal models of lung and renal fibrosis, the potential therapeutic usefulness of anticoagulant or profibrinolytic strategies is discussed.","813":"This review updates the latest developments concerning new anticoagulants. It describes potential targets in the coagulation pathway: inhibition of the initiation of coagulation, factor Xa and thrombin inhibitors. The focus is laid on substances in late development that already passed the phase II trial for venous thromboembolism (VTE)-prevention as \"proof of concept\". In the group of factor Xa inhibitors, the indirect inhibitor Fondaparinux has got approval for the indications prevention and therapy of VTE and acute coronary syndromes (OASIS 5 and 6). Rivaroxaban is the first direct factor Xa inhibitor that was admitted for approval in the indication VTE-prevention. The first trial of the program RECORD 1-4 was finished, trials for the indications therapy of VTE (EINSTEIN) and stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation (ROCKET AF) are in phase III. The use in acute coronary symptoms is - like apixaban - evaluated in phase II. The ADOPT trial with apixaban for VTE-prevention, as well as the BOTTICELLI trial for atrial fibrillation, have reached phase III. After the withdrawal of Ximelagatran, Dabigatran is the most developed direct thrombin inhibitor, being extensively studied in the comprehensive phase- III-program REVOLUTION and in approval for the indication VTE-prevention.","814":"Venous thromboembolism (VTE) is a rare disease that is being increasingly diagnosed and recognized in paediatrics in the past decade, usually as a secondary complication of primary severe underlying diseases. Apart from acquired thrombophilic risk factors, such as lupus anticoagulants, inherited thrombophilias (IT) have been established as risk factors for venous thromboembolic events in adults. In children with idiopathic VTE and in paediatric populations in which thromboses were associated with underlying medical diseases, IT have been described as additional prothrombotic risk factors. Follow-up data for VTE recurrence in children are available and suggest a recurrence rate of approximately 3% in neonates and 8% in other children. Here we present a review of the impact of IT on early onset of VTE and recurrence in children. Statistically significant associations between the IT traits investigated, e.g. factor V G1691A, factor II G20210A, protein C-, protein S-, antithrombin deficiency, elevated lipoprotein (a), combined IT and VTE onset were reported. In addition, statistically significant associations with recurrent VTE were calculated for protein S-, antithrombin-deficiency, and the factor II variant and combined IT. The absolute risk increase for VTE recurrence associated with IT ranged from 9.8 % for children carrying the factorII variant to 26% and 29% in children with combined IT and protein S-deficiency, respectively. Data obtained gave evidence that the detection of IT is clinically meaningful in children with VTE and underlines the importance of a paediatric thrombophilia screening program. Based on these data treatment algorithms have to be discussed.","815":"Life expectancy can be increased by life style changes such as improvement of nutrition habits and by physical activities. The relevance of physical activity for the prevention of cardiovascular diseases, especially coronary artery disease, is supported by several epidemiological studies. These data show a clear reduction by 35% in total as well as in cardiovascular-related mortality risk, due to primary prevention by physical activity. Within the secondary prevention, additional physical exercise leads to a marked decrease by 27% in the total, and by 31% in the cardiovascular-related mortality. This is due to improvement of the cardiovascular risk profile, including arterial blood pressure, lipid profile, type 2 diabetes, obesity as secondary effects. However, of particular importance are primary effects, such as restoration of the endothelial function, decrease of platelets reactivity, regression or a reduced progression of coronary sclerosis, and possible collateral formation as well as improvement of vascular repair by circulated endothelial progenitor cells. These beneficial effects can all be induced by the therapy called \"physical activity or endurance sports\". Provided this \"medicament\" is used correctly and individually adapted, it will be a low cost therapy and nearly without any adverse side effects for everyone. In order to maximise the outcome of individual health programs, an individually adjusted dosage of the type, intensity, duration, and frequency of physical activity is required.","816":"","817":"","818":"","819":"The translation of fundamental science-based constructs to the preemptive identification and optimal management of individuals with or those at risk for thrombotic disorders of the cardiovascular system has taken a step closer to being realized with the development of molecular technologies that include nucleic acid aptamers and their complimentary oligonucleotide antidotes. Herein, we summarize our experience with factor IX and von Willebrand factor aptamers, and introduce the era of antithrombotic pharmacobiologic therapy.","820":"Upon vascular injury, locally controlled haemostasis prevents life threatening blood loss and ensures wound healing. Intracellular material derived from damaged cells at these sites will become exposed to cells and plasma proteins and could thereby influence vascular homeostasis, blood coagulation and defense mechanisms. Recently, this concept was documented by several studies indicating that extracellular nucleic acids, and RNA in particular, serve as promoter of blood coagulation in vivo and significantly increase the permeability across brain endothelial cells in vitro and in vivo. As procoagulant cofactor and \"natural foreign material\", RNA triggers the contactphase pathway of blood coagulation and thereby contributes to pathological thrombus formation. Administration of RNase significantly delayed occlusive thrombus formation and prevented edema formation in different animal models. Thus, extracellular RNA derived from damaged and necrotic cells may serve as a natural danger signal that contributes to initiation of host defense mechanisms, while antagonizing RNase provides new regimens for antithrombotic and vessel-protective therapies.","821":"A stimulation of collateral vessel growth is an attractive alternative therapeutic tool especially for patients with diffuse occlusive vessel disease. Extensive in vivo and in vitro studies in the preceding decades have led us to a thorough understanding of basic arteriogenic principles. Due to the timeline of naturally occurring arteriogenesis, a well-timed therapeutic induction appears to be limiting for effective proarteriogenic therapies in high-risk patients. Potential therapeutic approaches are based on a stimulation of monocyte function through cytokine application. First clinical studies have, nevertheless, demonstrated the limits of a unifactorial therapy. Therefore, a stimulation of the mechanical inductor of arteriogenic proliferation, i. e. fluid shear stress acting on the arteriolar endothelium, appears as a feasible therapeutic addition. Current results show the feasibility of that principle not only through active physical training, but also through passive application of an external counterpulsation (EECP), a method showing promising first results in the clinical setting.","822":"The development of monoclonal antibodies facilitated an enormous progress in modern medicine in the last years. The targeted inhibition of defined molecular structures allows therapeutic concepts, which before were inconceivable. There are numerous antibodies in clinical use within the area of tumour therapy, chronically inflammatory diseases, transplantation, infections and also in cardiovascular medicine. Different antibody formats are used such as IgG molecules, Fab fragments and single chain antibodies. Single chain antibodies represent the smallest functional form of the antibody and are used preferentially as recombinant antibodies. The therapeutic possibilities of antibody technology are extended by fusion to radioactive or therapeutically active substances. This review focuses on the application of antibodies and fusion proteins as antithrombotic and fibrinolytic drugs. The use of antibodies allows the development of inhibitory agents with clearly defined functional properties, as for example for activation-specific GPIIb\/IIIa-blockade. In addition antibodies can be used for targeting antithrombotic and fibrinolytic agents to the thrombus, allowing an effective local action with less bleeding complications.","823":"The prognosis of patients suffering cardiac arrest is still poor. Until today, no drug therapy has shown to improve longterm survival after cardiac arrest. Thrombolysis has been shown to be an effective therapy in patients with acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or massive pulmonary embolism (PE). Since 50-70% of cardiac arrests are caused by AMI or massive PE, the combination of cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) and thrombolytic therapy appears to be sensible. As experimental studies have shown, thrombolytic therapy during CPR may not only be a causal treatment for coronary or pulmonary arterial obstruction by thrombi, but may also improve microcirculatory reperfusion after cardiac arrest. Although numerous small clinical studies have shown the efficacy of thrombolysis during CPR in selected patients, the generalized treatment of patients suffering cardiac arrest with thrombolytics can not be recommended based on current clinical evidence. According to the recent CPR guidelines, thrombolysis may be considered in cardiac arrest patients with suspected massive PE or as a so-called rescue therapy after unsuccessful conventional CPR in patients with a suspected thrombotic cause of cardiac arrest. The risk of severe bleeding complications following thrombolysis during CPR seems to be outweighed by the potential benefit of this therapy in selected patients.","824":"The introduction of thienopyridines, specifically of clopidogrel, offered for the first time an orally active therapeutic alternative to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) as an antiplatelet agent. Despite of established clinical efficacy, it became also evident with increasing clinical use that the antiplatelet actions of clopidogrel are subject of considerable interindividual variations of its antiplatelet efficacy (clopidogrel resistance) in laboratory tests which might also be clinically relevant. Prasugrel is a new, orally active thienopyridine with an expected spectrum of biological activities similar to clopidogrel. Prasugrel, like clopidogrel, is also an inactive prodrug that has to be transformed into the active metabolite by the liver cytochrome P450 system. However, different cytochromes appear to be involved for different extent in the generation of the active metabolite. The active metabolite of prasugrel, R-138727, inhibits irreversibly the platelet P2Y(12) ADP receptor. In contrast to ASA, neither clopidogrel nor prasugrel inhibit the arachidonic acid metabolism. This allows synergistic interactions with ASA as thromboxane inhibitor and PGI(2) as stimulator of cAMP-formation in platelets. Prasugrel is orally more potent and acts more rapidly than clopidogrel, allowing lower oral dosing despite of similar in vitro activity of the active metabolites. These pharmacological advantages of prasugrel are probably due to its improved pharmacokinetics, i.e. the higher conversion rate of the prodrug into the active metabolite. In case of clopidogrel, only about 10-15% of the prodrug is converted into the active metabolite. This higher conversion rate possibly also explains the more rapid onset of platelet inhibition, the lower interindividual variability and higher oral potency with apparently less \"resistance\" than clopidogrel. Clinically, this might result in an improved efficacy. Whether this is associated with an increased risk of bleeding will be seen from the first phase III clinical trial in PCI-patients. The first results are expected at the end of the year.","825":"Coronary stents are the mainstay of percutaneous coronary intervention. Stent thrombosis is a potentially catastrophic and often life-threatening complication. If it occurs it presents in up to 80% as myocardial infarction, about half of the affected patients die from this complication. The dual antiplatelet therapy has markedly reduced its occurrence. Today, stent thrombosis occurs in &lt;1%, usually as a delayed event; but compared to bare metal stents the overall incidence has not increased in meta-analyses of randomized trials. The advent of drug-eluting stents (DES) has raised concerns regarding the occurrence of delayed stent thrombosis. Delayed arterial wall healing as well as prothrombotic characteristics of the drug eluting stent itself may contribute to stent thrombosis. In order to prevent stent thrombosis a standardized fixed dose antiplatelet therapy with ASA and clopidogrel is recommended. But, their efficacy depends on patient's individual characteristics such drug metabolism. Therefore, individual determination of platelet function in each patient undergoing stent implantation may help to avoid prothrombotic as well as bleeding complications.","826":"Platelets play a critical role in formation of coronary thrombosis. An enhanced systemic platelet activation plays a significant role in the acute coronary syndrome. Despite better interventional techniques and better concomitant pharmacological therapy, the degree of platelet activation contributes significantly to prognosis and postinterventional event rate. Residual platelet activation after intervention is often associated with an enhanced initial platelet activation prior interventional treatment. An effective antiplatelet therapy is of utmost importance for the acute therapy and for secondary prevention in patients undergoing coronary interventions or with acute coronary syndrome. The efficacy of the antithrombotic therapy determines the long term prognosis in these patients.","827":"The direct thrombin inhibitor bivalirudin was tested in the ACUITY Trial 13 819 patients with acute non-ST-segment elevation coronary syndrome in a prospective and randomized design. Three therapeutic regimens were compared in the context of an early invasive strategy: heparin plus glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitor (GPI), bivalirudin plus GPI, or bivalirudin alone. Concerning the rate of ischaemic events bivalirudin alone was comparable to heparin plus GPI at a significantly lower rate of bleeding complications.","828":"The recently established correlation between bleeding events and clinical outcomes in patients with coronary artery disease undergoing either non-invasive or invasive treatment for acute coronary syndromes (ACS) highlights the unmet need for safer anticoagulants that can be used in conjunction with dual or triple antiplatelet therapy. The central position of the coagulation factors IIa and Xa within the coagulation system account for their prominent role as targets for anticoagulants. Unfractionated heparin (UFH) achieves a variable indirect inhibition of both factors. The low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) show favourable pharmacokinetics over UFH and have a more pronounced activity against factor Xa as opposed to thrombin which may partially account for the benefits observed with LMWH in clinical trials. New agents that have been developed allow for a selective inhibition of factor Xa. Recently, exciting results have been reported with an indirect selective inhibitor of factor Xa in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) -acute coronary syndromes (ACS) and non-STEMI-ACS. In this article the pharmacology of the indirect selective factor Xa inhibitors Fondaparinux and Idraparinux will be discussed along with the direct selective factor Xa inhibitors DX-9065a and Otamixaban in the setting of interventional cardiology.","829":"Recent advances in the diagnosis and the treatment of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) have led to a substantial reduction of major coronary events, to an improvement in patient outcome and the definition of new guidelines. Current strategies for the treatment of patients with non-ST-elevation ACS recommend a combined antithrombotic therapy (including aspirin, clopidogrel, anticoagulation with low-molecular weight or unfractionated heparins or FXa-inhibitors or direct antithrombins and, eventually glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa receptor antagonists). This combined antithrombotic therapy allows to increase the benefit of an early invasive strategy including coronary angiogram with stent percutaneous coronary angioplasty. The purpose of this review is to discuss and highlight the recommendations for the appropriate use of antithrombotic strategies in the setting of angioplasty in ACS patients.","830":"","831":"The development of inhibitors in patients with severe haemophilia A is a serious complication requiring long term immune tolerance therapy (ITT). ITT frequently requires implantable central venous access, mostly port catheters. Their use may be complicated by thrombosis and infection. We report on an 18 year old patient with severe haemophilia A who had developed a high-titre factor VIII inhibitor in the age of five years. ITT required the implantation of a port system. The postoperative course was complicated by severe septicaemia with congestive cardiac failure. The port catheter was removed due to recurrent fever after 26 days. Our patient developed dilative cardiomyopathy. ITT had to be stopped and was replaced by on demand therapy with an activated prothrombin complex concentrate. Cardiomyopathy resulted in congestive heart failure, severe ventricular arrhythmias and the death of the young man. In patients with haemophilia, dilative cardiomyopathy and development of inhibitors the possibility of cardiac transplantation should be evaluated before increasing inhibitors and the development of pulmonary hypertension exclude this therapeutical option.","832":"Rivaroxaban (Xarelto) is a novel, oral, direct Factor Xa (FXa) inhibitor in late-stage development for the prevention and treatment of thromboembolic disorders. Rivaroxaban inhibits clot-associated and free FXa activity, and prothrombinase activity, and reduces thrombin generation. In animal models, rivaroxaban prevented venous and arterial thrombosis, and was effective at treating venous thrombosis. Rivaroxaban has high oral bioavailability, a rapid onset of action and predictable pharmacokinetics. In phase II studies, rivaroxaban was effective and well tolerated for the prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after major orthopaedic surgery, and for the treatment of deep vein thrombosis. In a phase III study, rivaroxaban demonstrated significantly superior efficacy to enoxaparin for thromboprophylaxis after total knee arthroplasty, with similar low bleeding. Rivaroxaban is also being assessed for the treatment and secondary prevention of VTE, prevention of stroke in patients with atrial fibrillation and secondary prevention in patients with acute coronary syndrome. Rivaroxaban is a promising alternative to current pharmacological agents for thromboembolic disorders.","833":"The primary focus of the blood coagulation system is the prevention of blood loss. The system is regulated by various inhibitors, and by the fibrinolytic system, which removes the final product of the blood coagulation system, the fibrin clot. The fibrinolytic system is activated in the course of coagulation activation. The thrombin-activated fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI) is an important regulator of fibrinolysis. TAFI is activated by thrombin, and activation is enhanced in the presence of thrombomodulin. TAFIa, the product of TAFI activation, removes lysine residues from fibrin, which are essential for the binding of t-PA, plasminogen, and plasmin to fibrin. The fibrin loses its cofactor activity in t-PA-induced plasminogen activation, resulting in less plasmin, and the remaining plasmin finds less binding sites on fibrin, resulting in an increased resistance of the clot towards plasmin proteolysis. High concentrations of thrombin result in high TAFIa-activity and consequently in highly resistant fibrin clots. Patients with hyperprothrombinaemia consequently display elevated TAFIa-levels, which may contribute to the risk for thrombosis. Treatment with recombinant factor VIIa also leads to high concentrations of thrombin, resulting in fibrin clots with enhanced resistance towards fibrinolysis. At low thrombin concentration, as observed in patients with bleeding disorders or patients treated with anticoagulant drugs, less TAFIa is produced in the course of coagulation activation, and the clots are less resistant towards fibrinolysis. TAFIa-inhibitors are currently being developed for the treatment of throboembolic disorders or hypofibrinolytic DIC. Enhancement of TAFIa-activity may be helpful in patients with bleeding.","834":"Malignant effusions are a frequent problem for cancer patients. Due to the high resistance of tumor cells within these effusions, no effective treatment has been defined yet. Most patients exhibit additional phenomena related to hyper-coagulability such as elevated levels for d-dimers and prothrombin fragments f1.2; half of them suffer from manifest thrombosis or complications. We followed the hypothesis that the activated coagulation system contributes to the resistance of tumor cells and analyzed the effusions from cancer patients. The majority of isolated tumor cells aberrantly expressed PAR-1 thrombin receptors. In vitro pre-incubation of PAR-1 expressing human leukemia cells with thrombin resulted in a dose-dependent resistance to idarubicin. Within the effusions, we did not only find high concentrations of VEGF and tissue factor, but also all coagulation factors of the tissue factor pathway. Very high levels of prothrombin fragments f1.2 indicate constant thrombin generation. Upon the basis of these findings, we developed a multistep model elucidating the pathophysiological generation of malignant effusions, which might serve as a basis for further examinations.","835":"Bleeding tendency as a result of clotting factor deficiency is common knowledge. The counterpart, i.e. thrombophilia due to high clotting factor levels, is not surprising, but an association between factor level and thrombosis risk has just recently been described. The role of high factor VIII (FVIII) levels is well documented. The risk of high FVIII levels for the first event is similarly high as that of APC resistance. There is a familiar background of high FVIII levels. Alterations within the FVIII or the von Willebrand factor genes seem to be not causal since polymorphisms of these genes are not associated with venous thromboembolism. An increased FVIII\/VWF ratio indicates a reduced FVIII clearance. Probably, the low-density lipoprotein receptor-related protein, i.e. the receptor mediating the hepatic clearance of the FVIII-VWF-complex, is involved. The well known prothrombin G20210A polymorphism is associated with high prothrombin levels perhaps contributing to thrombosis risk via clot resistance against fibrinolysis.","836":"The availability of mice with defined defects within the hemostatic system enabled researchers to identify a role the coagulation system for embryonic and placental development. However, the role of platelets during development has only recently been experimentally addressed, giving some insight into potential functions of platelets during development. Thus, a quantitative embryonic platelet defect (severe thrombopenia secondary to NF-E2 deficiency) is associated with an embryonic growth retardation and reduced vascularisation of the placenta. Maternal platelet deficiency is associated with placental haemorrhage, which, however, does not impair embryonic or maternal survival. In vitro studies established that platelets or platelet conditioned medium regulate the invasive properties of human extravillous trophoblast cells and induce a phenotypical switch of trophoblast cells. These data imply that platelets are of relevance during placentation. Conversely, platelets and the formation of platelet-fibrin aggregates are dispensable for the development of the embryo proper, establishing that the lethal phenotypes observed in some embryos lacking coagulation regulators does not result from an inability to form platelet-fibrin aggregates, but likely reflects altered protease dependent signaling during vascular development.","837":"Apart from on-label indications, recombinant factor VIIa (rFVIIa) is increasingly administered for treatment of life threatening bleeding events when appropriate standard therapy fails. Case reports and short treatment series document the efficacy and safety of rFVIIa to achieve haemostasis in patients with platelet function disorders and thrombocytopenias of various origin. An established on-label indication for the use of rFVIIa is given in patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia with refractoriness to transfusions of platelet concentrates. Bolus applications of rFVIIa at dosages between 80 and 120 microg\/kg body weight every 1.5 to 3 h are also administered successfully in patients with Bernard-Soulier syndrome, platelet storage pool defects, and other acquired platelet function disorders. In patients with Glanzmann thrombasthenia, at least three bolus injections are required to achieve effective haemostasis. In approximately half of the patients with thrombocytopenias, a single bolus of rFVIIa has been shown to be sufficient in managing otherwise untreatable bleeding complications. In these patients, haemostasis was achieved even at platelet counts &lt;20,000\/microl, although the efficacy of rFVIIa increases at higher platelet concentrations.","838":"Haemostasis is the concerted action of blood components aimed at prevention of blood loss after vessel injury. Thrombosis is the other side of the coin, a misled physiological process, i.e. a haemostatic reaction occurring at a diseased vessel wall. Haemodynamic forces enrich platelets in a fluid boundary layer adjacent to the vessel wall where they flow along the endothelium scanning it for defects. Once the platelets detect an injury they immediately adhere--a process beginning with initial deceleration and attachment via glykoprotein (GP) Ibalpha receptor-binding to immobilized von Willebrand factor (VWF). The GPIb receptor requires no stimulation. This is in contrast to subsequently interacting receptors such as integrin alphaIIbbeta3 (GPIIb\/IIIa), integrin alpha2beta1, and GP VI, which are activated via outside-in and inside-out signalling. The latter receptors bind to their respective ligands: VWF, fibrinogen, collagen and other subendothelial proteins. Upon the first layer of adherent platelets additional accrual of platelets is transient when mediated by VWF, but is then stabilized by fibrinogen bridging integrin alphaIIbbeta3 receptors on neighboring platelets. Such aggregates present a large mass of procoagulant membranes, the surface of which serves for complexation and activation of clotting factors. Thereby fibrin polymerization is accelerated manyfold. In addition, platelets contain mRNA for fast production of tissue factor, the most effective trigger of extrinsic coagulation. The formed fibrin fibers stabilize the platelet aggregates against detachment by shear forces. A shortened clotting time probably due to activated membranes was also found with microparticles generated at high shear rates through GPIb-VWF-interaction. Thus, platelets and platelet derived microparticles seem to play an important role not only in focussing the haemostatic response to the region of injury but also in initiating and accelerating the subsequent clotting reaction.","839":"Platelets are anucleated cells and therefore ideal research objects for modern proteome analyses. Despite their importance in thrombosis and hemostasis the protein content of platelets is still poorly characterized in major parts. In preparation for bioinformatic and functional studies a series of proteomic analyses was conducted for platelet subproteomes as well as for posttranslational modifications. Thereby, the identification of 489 proteins, over 550 phosphorylations and 326 N-glycosylation sites was possible, which were not identified in previous proteome studies of platelets. Those results represent new research possibilities for functional characterization of platelet proteins as well as their modifications.","840":"","841":"Plasma coagulation in mammals shows an essentially uniform structure. Differences are in species specific composition and quantity of coagulation factors. Many of the coagulation disorders occurring in humans have been observed in other mammals. Almost all the coagulation studies performed to date have been in domestic animals. For the majority of mammalian species, e.g. zoo animals, therefore, we have either no data at all or only isolated results. The methods used for coagulation testing in veterinary medicine have not yet been standardized. The significance and informative value of the screening tests are limited in animals compared with humans. The activities of individual factors in animals are determined by coagulometric tests. The results can be determined in relation to the activity in humans with the help of a human normal plasma or in relation to the activity of the respective animal with the help of a normal plasma from the same species. The problem is the parallelity of the dilution curves used as reference curves. The coagulation factor activities given for mammals usually differ more or less markedly from those in humans.","842":"Nine unusual bleeding and clotting disorders (or mimickers of such) are described in the format of case presentations, with focus on clinical history, images and diagnostic tests, followed by a discussion of the disease itself and a summarizing clinical teaching point. The disease entities discussed are acquired factor VIII inhibitor, acquired von Willebrand factor inhibitor, haemophilic pseudotumour, Gardner-Diamond syndrome, coumarin-induced skin necrosis, purple toe syndrome, brachiocephalic vein thrombosis with breast enlargement, and leg swelling due to nephrogenic fibrosing dermopathy and lymphoedema. The publication is meant to demonstrate the fascination of clinical coagulation.","843":"Isolated reduction in factor V activity either occur in form of a hereditary deficiency of factor V as an acquired inhibitor against factor V. Diagnosis can not be made by bleeding alone because in both cases it can occur or not occur. Two patients were investigated showing pathological screening tests of coagulation without bleeding. A hereditary and an acquired deficiency of factor V were proved.","844":"In patients post organ transplantation, the underlying disorder necessitating the transplantation, as well as the transplantation itself, can both mask pre-existing haemostatic abnormalities or lead to them. Since the liver is the main production site for coagulation factors, orthotopic liver transplantation predestinates for acquiring or losing a genetically determined coagulation defect. In coagulation diagnostics, this may lead to a discrepancy between functional plasma tests and molecular biologic findings if these are gathered from nucleated cells of the peripheral blood, as is the standard. Due to the rareness of most defects and the lack of consequences in case of diagnosis of a more common coagulation disorder, no general screening before or after transplantation is required. Underlying diseases leading to liver transplantation as well as the actual transplantation must be considered when interpreting the findings.","845":"The findings of a large prospective study designed to identify primary and\/or secondary haemostatic disorders before surgical interventions are presented. A total of 5649 unselected adult patients were enrolled to identify impaired haemostasis before surgical interventions. Each patient was asked to answer a standardized questionnaire concerning bleeding history. Activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), prothrombin time (PT), and platelet counts (PC) including PFA-100 (platelet function analyzer): collagen-epinephrine (C\/E), and collagen-ADP (C\/ADP) were routinely done in all patients. Additional tests, bleeding time (BT), von Willebrand factor (VWF:Ag, VWF:Rcof) and a further haemostaseological diagnostic was performed only in patients with a positive bleeding history and\/or evidence of impaired haemostasis; e.g., drug ingestion. The bleeding history was negative in 5021 patients (88.8%) but positive in the remaining 628 (11.2%). Impaired haemostasis could be verified only in 256 (40.8%) of these patients. The vast majority was identified with PFA-100: C\/E (n = 250; 97.7%). The sensitivity of the PFA-100: collagen-epinephrine was the highest (90.8%) in comparison to the other screening tests (BT, aPTT, PT, VWF : Ag). The positive predictive value (to detection of impaired haemostasis) of the PFA-100: collagen-epinephrine with the standardized questionnaire was high (82%), but the negative predictive value was higher (93%). The use of a standardized questionnaire and, if indicated, the PFA-100: C\/E and\/or other specific tests not only ensure the detection of impaired haemostasis in almost every case but also a significant reduction of the costs. Based on these data, national regards are formulated or under construction.","846":"Therapy with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) and\/or clopidogrel is used to achieve prophylactic inhibition of platelet aggregation in patients with arterial thrombosis. We examined if aggregometry can be used to see the effect of antiplatelet drugs (ASA 30, 50, 100, 300 mg\/d, clopidogrel 75 mg\/d or ASA 100 + clopidogrel 75 mg\/d). A modified platelet aggregation test was used to investigate maximum aggregation in response to ADP, collagen, adrenalin and arachidonic acid. Reference values were established based on healthy individuals. We devised a simple scoring system for detection of inadequate platelet inhibition. Compared with the control group, we detected a significant delay of maximum aggregation in response to all agonists in patients on ASA and combination therapy ASA + clopidogrel. Patients on clopidogrel alone were found to have prolonged aggregation when induced with ADP, collagen and arachidonic acid. The failure rate to achieve adequate platelet inhibition on 100 mg\/d ASA, 75 mg\/d clopidogrel or combination therapy was 27%, 26% and 7%, respectively. Our results demonstrate that platelet inhibition in aggregometry is inadequate in many patients with arterial thrombosis.","847":"In this study two aspirin sensitive platelet function tests which are based on the analysis of whole blood were evaluated and correlated with each other. In vitro bleeding time was determined using the PFA-100 analyzer (Dade Behring, Marburg, Germany) using the collagen\/epinephrine cartridge and citrated blood. Whole blood aggregometry was performed using the Multiplate analyzer (Dynabyte medical, Munich, Germany) using hirudin blood (25 mug\/ml). Aggregatin was triggered using arachidonic acid (ASPItest), collagen (COLtest) or TRAP-6 (thrombin receptor activating peptide, TRAPtest). Following informed consent citrated blood and hirudin blood was drawn from 76 cardiovascular patients which were on long-term aspirin therapy (aspirin patients). In addition hirudin blood was drawn from 57 healthy blood donors for assessment of whole blood aggregometry. PFA-100 closure times of the aspirin patients were 273 +\/- 49 s. Based on the cut-off of 170 s a non response to the aspirin therapy was detected in 5 of 76 patients. Whole blood aggregation was comparable in the aspirin patients vs the blood donors AUC values in the TRAP test, whereas in COLtest and ASPItest significantly reduced aggregations were detected (p &lt; 0.05). Of the five patients that had a normal PFA-100 closure time only one had normal aggregation in ASPItest, and also only one had a normal aggregation in COLtest. The high rate of response to the aspirin therapy which was found in PFA-100 and ASPItest can be explained by the assumed high level of compliance of the cohort. In the applied tests different patients were stratified as aspirin-non-responders. This highlights the importance of the assay conditions for the diagnosis of an aspirin-non-response.","848":"A major challenge in the treatment of haemophilia patients is the development of autoantibodies against factor VIII. These patients are at particular risk if spontaneous bleedings or traumata occur or if surgery is necessary. In case of an unsuccessful immune tolerance therapy with high i.v. doses of factor VIII, treatment with recombinant factor VIIa or activated prothrombin complex should be considered. This article summarises data of three patients with severe haemophila A due to an inversion of intron 22 in the FVIII gen. All three patients had autoantibodies against FVIII. The therapy of these patients with rFVIIIa was safe and effective. Furthermore a prophylactic therapy with rFVIIa (at an individual dose of 180-270 microg\/kg body weight) reduced the number of spontaneous bleedings in joints and muscles as well as in other locations significantly. The reduced rate of spontaneous bleedings improved the mobility and the quality of life in the young patients studied.","849":"Therapy and diagnosis of the diabetic foot syndrome are almost standardized, all procedures are well established. There are no challenges in technical dimensions. But the rate of major amputations remains unacceptably high in Germany. Because there are other causes than lack of medical knowledge, this review describes the somatologic, psychiatric, and philosophic perspectives of the problem.","850":null,"851":"The central enzyme of blood coagulation, the serine proteinase thrombin, is capable to modify the growth of tumour cells by interaction with protease activated receptors 1 and 4 of the tumour cells. Thrombin is permanently available in tumour micro environment; meizothrombin is generated from prothrombin at a tumour specific activation complex and can influence tumour cell growth via PAR-1 and 7-transdomain protein receptor signalling pathway, too. PEG-coupled direct thrombin inhibitors that possess special pharmacokinetic characteristics and that have been designed for long lasting efficacy in extracellular space, control serine proteinase activity in tumour micro environment and therefore they own a high potential anti-tumour efficacy. In xenographic tumour models this new substance class has shown a significant carcinostatic effect.","852":"Lower-extremity amputation (LEA) is a common complication among patients with diabetes. This study tests the effects of a structured disease management program for the diabetic foot (DF) aiming to reduce the number of LEA. DESIGN, METHODS: In a prospective study design we investigate patients with DF in a system of outpatient treatment, acute in-patient care and rehabilitative treatment. Subjects were recruited since January 1(st), 2000, with the latest admission being December 31, 2004. All study participants undergo a five-year follow-up observation period. The University of Texas Wound Classification System (UT) of foot ulcers serves as basis of the documentation and analysis. We evaluated numbers of LEA, rates of ulcer healing and underlying forms of peripheral vascular disease. We report the results of the first patient group completing the two-year follow-up examination. In 2000, 102 subjects with new foot ulcers were consecutively included into the study. 68.6% were men, the mean age of the study population was 68.1 +\/- 11.4 years and the mean diabetes duration was 19.4 +\/- 10.3 years. After two years, 68 patients can still be examined. Altogether, 22 patients (21.6%) died, and 12 (11.8%) dropped out for various reasons. At the point of discharge from the clinics 35.3% of the ulcers had healed and another 44.1% were in UT grade 1. After two years, a complete healing could still be determined with 51 patients (50.0% of the cohort of the original 102 patients, or 75.0% of the subjects reaching the two-year follow-up). 10 subjects (9.8% or 14.5%) were in the UT grade 1. Eight diabetics underwent major amputation (MA) during the two-year examination period (amputation rate 7.8%). The primary objective of the study, a significant reduction of MA with DF patients, has been achieved. The ulcer healing rates are comparable to the reports of leading centers. ","853":"During the use of fractionated or unfractionated heparin adverse events frequently occur that can endanger the continuation of therapy. Especially in pregnant patients with thromboembolic complications it may be difficult to find a suitable alternative anticoagulant when heparin-induced thrombocytopenia type II (HIT II) or allergic skin reactions occur. There are still limited data on the use of danaparoid in pregnancy. The main reason for heparin intolerance in the 59 reviewed pregnancies were either HIT II, described in 37\/59 (62.7%) pregnancies, or cutaneous adverse effects in 19\/22 (86.4%) of non-HIT-associated pregnancies (22\/59, 37.3%). 40\/59 pregnancies were carried to term under use of danaparoid and resulted in the delivery of a healthy infant. In 16\/19 pregnancies, danaparoid was stopped due to a major adverse event. Five patients showed bleeding complications, seven fetal losses were documented, but there was no association with the use of danaparoid. In 31\/59 (52.5%) pregnancies adverse events were documented, 14\/31 (45.2%) could be attributed to danaparoid. Anti-Xa-activity was not detected in five fetal cord blood samples and in four maternal breast-milk samples. Danaparoid can be used as an alternative anticoagulant in pregnant women with high risk for thrombosis and heparin intolerance. ","854":"To date, no effective adjuvant drug preventing the aggressive spread of tumour cells in late stages of cancer disease or at the time-point of primary tumour removal is available. Although proteases, including members of the large serine protease family, were shown to be promising targets for an anti-metastatic cancer therapy, synthetic protease inhibitors (SPIs) have so far failed to be introduced into the clinic. In addition to considerations in the design of classical in vivo -tests of SPIs as cancer therapy agents, we here review our findings with a straightforward, highly sensitive and very fast in vivo metastasis model and its implications in the development of efficient anti-metastatic SPIs. The lacZ-tagging of tumour cells of this very aggressive T-cell lymphoma model allowed highly sensitive and reproducible detection of metastases within seven days after tumour cell inoculation by X-gal staining of whole organs, allowing cost-effective and material-saving side-by-side screening of a series of SPIs with different specificities for different serine proteases. By establishment of specificity\/antimetastatic efficacy correlations we identified coagulation factor Xa as one important target of anti-metastatic SPIs and could use this information for the subsequent design and optimization of factor Xa-specific lead structures. We exemplify the usefulness of high-throughput in vivo analysis to direct optimization of lead structures and how this may allow unexpected insight into the molecular biology of metastasis. ","855":"The severe impairment of the microcirculation plays a substantial role in the pathogenesis of severe sepsis and septic shock, and leads to multiple organ failure and death. Therapeutic strategies to resuscitate the microcirculatory blood flow and to improve the functional capillar density are therefore essential to surmount the microcirculatory pathology and to avoid tissue hypoxia. Based on reasonable scientific evidence, early fluid resuscitation directed by defined haemodynamic and metabolic goals (EGDT) as well as the application of activated protein C (rhAPC) according to the guidelines could be recommended. Dobutamine is the first choice to improve cardiac output and to overcome myocardial depression in septic shock whereas phosphodiesterase-III-inhibitors and levosimendane are still experimental options. Furthermore selective inhibitors of iNOS, nitroglycerol, as well as vasopressin have to be investigated relating to their specific effects on the microcirculation and their influence on survival in seevere sepsis and septic shock.","856":"Tissue factor (TF) is the major initiator of blood coagulation, and a mediator of inflammation, angiogenesis, and carcinogenesis. According to recent evidence, preformed TF and inducible expression of the protein is observed in several blood components. TF is apparently constitutively expressed on circulating microparticles, and can be exposed within minutes on the cell membrane of activated eosinophils and platelets, and, potentially, on neutrophils. Expression in monocytes and neutrophils largely requires transcriptional activation of the TF gene. Eosinophils appear to harbour the highest concentration of preformed TF among all blood components under resting conditions. TF expression in eosinophil progenitor cells is substantially higher than in precursors of other granulocyte fractions. Eosinophil TF promotes transendothelial migration, which documents that presynthesized TF in blood supports functions apart from coagulation. It is still an open question how the intravascular TF is activated to trigger initiation of coagulation. TF activation in different blood components is likely to be differentially regulated according to the (patho)physiologic context.","857":"THROMKID is a quality project of the Paediatric Group of German Thrombosis and Haemostasis Research Society (GTH). Data from paediatric patients with hereditary thrombocytopathies (HT) treated in Germany, Austria, and Switzerland were obtained between May 2005 and August 2006. By evaluation of results of platelet function tests criteria were determined to assess the diagnosis in each patient into most likely, likely or unlikely. A total of 215 patients treated in 31 centers were identified. In 95 patients (44%) the diagnosis of HT was most likely, in 28 (13%) likely and in 92 (43%) unlikely. Taken the first two groups together (n = 123) the diagnoses were as follows: Glanzmann thrombasthenia (n = 39, 32%), Aspirin-like defect (n = 26, 21%), thrombocyte receptor defects (n = 21, 17%), storage pool disorders (n = 18, 15%), Bernard-Soulier syndrome (n = 10, 8%), Hermansky-Pudlak syndrome (n = 6, 5%) and MYH9-related hereditary makrothrombocytopenia (n = 3, 2%). The low prevalence of these diseases and the high percentage of patients with unclassified HT stresses the necessity for the establishment of a competence network for comprehensive care of these patients in the three German-speaking countries.","858":"Heparins and vitamin K antagonists have been the cornerstones of anticoagulation therapy for several decades. Although they are very effective at inhibiting the coagulation process, they have several practical limitations. This was a challenge for the development of therapies that will overcome these drawbacks while matching the efficacy of the two classes of anticoagulants. Advances were achieved in the development of safer, convenient, more specific treatments, which should provide predictable anticoagulant responses and substantially improve the prevention and management of thromboembolic disorders. In the search for new agents matching the ideal anticoagulant profile, different steps in the coagulation cascade have been targeted, including direct thrombin inhibition, and inhibition of factor Xa, factor IXa, the factor Vlla-tissue factor complex and the factor Va-factor Vllla complex. The most advanced clinical development has been achieved with direct factor Xa- and factor IIa-inhibitors which may replace conventional anticoagulants for long-term prevention and treatment of venous and arterial thromboembolic complications.","859":"Making decisions about any modality of secondary prophylaxis in patients with venous thromobembolism (VTE) has to balance the risk of bleeding induced by anticoagulants against the benefit of reducing the risk of recurrent disease. It has to be kept in mind that the magnitude of risk is not only defined by the number of events per time period but also by the impact of the event on the fate of the patient. With standard intensity vitamin K antagonists (VKA), the risk of bleeding is more closely related to comorbidities than to other factors, eg age. The risk of VTE recurrence differs largely between patient groups. The criterion of presence or absence of a permanent or transient clinical trigger factor for the actual VTE episode has a greater impact than an abnormal result in thrombophilia testing. The standard period of secondary prophylaxis for proximal DVT and for PE is three to six months. The concept of prolonging this period for several months according to the risk of recurrence is seriously challanged by the observation that the prolongation period seems to delay recurrencies rather than truly avoiding them. For this reason, patients who clearly are threatened by recurrent episodes should receive indefinitive secondary prophylaxis. This is the case for cancer patients, patients with the antiphospholipid syndrome, and those who belong to families with severe and symptomatic protein C, protein S, or antithrombin deficiencies. Patients with recurrent VTE, with idiopathic VTE, or with combined thrombophilic conditions may only benefit from indefinitive secondary prophylaxis if the bleeding risk of the anticoagulant regimen under consideration is very low.","860":"The detection of the DNA-sequence of human coagulation factors and inhibitors has introduced the possibility of differentiated mutation analysis in patients with venous thrombosis. Since venous thromboembolism is a multifactorial disease, women are at an increased risk to develop venous thrombosis due to hormonal contraception, during pregnancy and the puerperium. In addition, pregnancy complications like early or late fetal loss, pregnancy-induced hypertensive disorders and very recently recurrent embryo implantation failure have been suspected to be associated with thrombophilia. Therefore, it is of major importance to define inherited thrombophilic disorders, in which genetic diagnosis is of clinical relevance. While most of the genetic defects described so far represent a risk factor for venous thrombosis, only a minority of these defects actually needs DNA analysis to be detected: mutation analysis is clinically relevant, when factor V Leiden mutation is suspected, because relative risks concerning venous thrombosis as well as pregnancy complications clearly differ between homozygote and heterozygote forms of this frequently observed mutation. Similarly detection of the prothrombin mutation G20210A is of clinical relevance, although data for the very rarely observed homozygote variant are not sufficiently available. In contrast, detection of the homozygote variant of the MTHFR-mutation C677T is not useful, since clinical relevance could not be proven in a majority of studies concerning women specific risk situations. Inherited deficiencies of antithrombin, protein C and protein S are rare with high rates of different mutations. Genetic analysis seems only useful in patients with wide intraindividual variations of coagulation inhibitor activities. Genetic analysis concerning the PAI-1 4G\/5G polymorphism or the factor XIII Val34Leu polymorphism can not be recommended in women specific risk situations because of insufficient data.","861":"One of the challenges in clinical diabetology today is to develop and implement diabetes prevention management programs for clinical practice. Recent studies have convincingly demonstrated that lifestyle intervention, addressing diet and exercise as well as pharmacologic preventive strategies reduced the risk of progressing from impaired glucose tolerance to diabetes. With respect to the worldwide burden of diabetes these studies offer a compelling evidence-base for the important translation of the research findings into community-based prevention strategies and the development of a National Diabetes Prevention Program. The workgroup \"diabetes prevention\" from the German Diabetes Association together with the National Action Forum Diabetes and the German Diabetes Foundation developed a concept for a National Program. This comprises a 3-step-intervention: in a first step individuals at high risk to develop type 2 diabetes are identified. The second step provides an intensive group intervention to prevent diabetes and in a third step continuous intervention should facilitate motivation maintenance and evaluation. This third step is the crucial step to maintain the effect in changing lifestyle. Recently, a compendium for diabetes prevention was developed as a practical guideline explaining how to implement prevention programs. This guideline also includes the structure of a national prevention program with a prevention manager having a central role in the concept and suggestions for evaluation and quality control.","862":"This review focuses on the role of vascular oxidative stress in the development and progression of endothelial dysfunction. We discuss different sources of oxidative stress in the vessel wall, oxidative stress and coagulation, the role of oxidative stress and vascular function in arteries and veins, the flow-dependent regulation of reactive oxygen species, the putative impact of oxidative stress on atherosclerosis, the interaction of angiotensin II, oxidative stress and endothelial dysfunction, and clinical implications.","863":"","864":"Acquired von Willebrand syndrome is a rare bleeding disorder associated with other primary diseases such as cardiovascular disorders which can cause severe haemorrhage during surgery or interventional procedures. It should be suspected if there is no history of bleeding and abnormal von Willebrand factor (VWF) values in patients with predisposing disorders. We present two children with congenital heart defects and no personal or family history of bleeding. In these patients we preoperative diagnosed acquired von Willebrand syndrome with coagulation tests including analysis of the VWF multimeric pattern.","865":"Patients suffering a transient ischaemic attack (TIA) or ischaemic stroke (IS) have a high recurrence risk. Secondary prevention aims to prevent not only further strokes but also cardiac events. Important parts of secondary prevention regimens are the modification of vascular risk factors and the inhibition of platelet function or anticoagulation if indicated. The inhibition of platelet function is effective in the reduction of secondary vascular events in patients with TIA or stroke. This is true for acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), clopidogrel, and the combination of ASA plus slow-release dipyridamole. A prediction model which allows to identify patients in whom clopidogrel or dipyridamol plus ASA is superior to ASA for the secondary prevention of stroke is presented.","866":"Standard therapy of acute ischaemic stroke during the first three hours after symptom onset is intravenous thrombolysis. When contraindications exist, an endovascular approach might be possible. Intraarterial administration of thrombolytic drugs is the most common way. Additionally, there is an increasing use of mechanical tools that are expected to be faster and more effective. Three principles of mechanical thrombolysis are known: aspiration, extraction and fracturing of the thrombus. Different tools were tested clinically and some demonstrated its high efficiency. Larger studies are needed to compare those tools. Apart from recanalization of a cerebral vessel occlusion implantation of a stent might be necessary for prophylaxis of recurrent stroke.","867":"Current therapeutic concepts for acute cerebral ischaemia and cerebral haemorrhage are summarized. Patient selection for thrombolysis, the role of stroke MRI and the choice of recanalization techniques are discussed. The treatment of intracerebral haemorrhage with particular emphasis on evacuation of haematoma and acute haemostatic therapy are discussed.","868":"Hereditary and acquired coagulation disorders may play an important role in the pathophysiology of acute ischaemic stroke. Because of the low prevalence of these disorders and the considerable costs of unmindful diagnostic effort, a custom-tailored approach is desirable. Suggestive in favour of a possible prothrombotic clotting disorder are young patients, repeated episodes of thrombosis in the patient's history, inappropriate atherosclerotic vascular changes, previous repeated miscarriages in stroke patients, or structural cardiac abnormalities as a patent foramen ovale. Disorders affecting antithrombin III, protein C und S, APC-resistance, the prothrombin mutation, homocysteinaemia, antiphospholipid antibodies, and procoagulatory cellular interaction are discussed.","869":"Cerebrovascular disease is caused by ischaemic stroke, intracerebral haemorrhage, subarachnoidal haemorrhage or cerebral vein and sinus thrombosis. Approximately 80% of all cerebrovascular accidents are caused by ischaemic stroke, whereas 20% are due to primary haemorrhage. This article summarizes the typical causes of each of the four main groups of cerebrovascular disease and points out clinical differences. Special attention is given to transitory ischemic attacks since new reports underline the necessity of early diagnostic and therapeutic intervention. Useful diagnostic and clinical scales are presented and discussed.","870":"Stroke constitutes a major global challenge for health policy and healthcare economics. Reducing stroke burden requires extensive knowledge of risk factors and, if applicable, preventive control. Risk factors may be categorized in non-modifiable biological factors, such as age, gender, race\/ethnicity; proatherosclerotic\/prothrombotic factors (hypertension, diabetes, dyslipidaemia, other serologic and haemostasis factors); cardiac comorbidity (CAD, CHF, atrial fibrillation); lifestyle factors, which play an increasing role, e.g. smoking, physical inactivity, alcohol consumption. These traditional risk factors are extended by rapidly growing efforts in elucidating genetic backgrounds for stroke. Genetic polymorphisms of functionally or pathophysiologically important proteins are investigated in the setting of case-control-studies for their role as candidate genes. Meta-analyses have corroborated the association of the factor V-Leiden arg506gln, MTHFR-C677T, and ACE-insertion-deletion polymorphisms with stroke. Current population-based, genome-wide linkage analyses face high expectations for identifying new genetic risk factors.","871":"Cardiac surgery carries a remarkable risk of blood loss requiring transfusion of blood products. Moreover, severe bleeding necessitating reoperation occurs in 3-5% of patients according to international studies. These patients face a significantly higher morbidity and mortality. This underscores the need for a safe and effective haemostatic therapy, which may significantly improve the outcome. Recombinant activated factor VII is approved for haemophiliacs with inhibitors and patients with thrombasthenia Glanzmann and factor VII deficiency. In the proceeding years a series of articles has been published reporting the successful and safe therapy of refractory bleeding after cardiac surgery. This review focuses at presenting the pathophysiological alterations of the haemostatic system related to the cardiopulmonary bypass. These alterations are thought to explain the high risk of bleeding after cardiopulmonary bypass. Furthermore, the use of rFVIIa in paediatric and adult cardiac surgery is reviewed and critically discussed.","872":"In the course of liver transplantation many patients develop coagulation and bleeding disorders. On the other hand, some patients suffer thromboembolic events in the perioperative period with sometimes fatal outcome. For this reason, in 1999 we changed our coagulation management for liver transplantation and abolished the routine prophylaxis with antifibrinolytic drugs. In this context we implemented the ROTEM system (Pentapharm GmbH, Munich) in our perioperative point-of-care coagulation management. From 2000 to 2005, we analysed more than 18,000 ROTEM measurements in the context of 642 liver transplantations. Prophylactic administration of antifibrinolytic drugs was only done in patients with fulminant liver failure or if MCF in ExTEM&lt;or=35 mm at the beginning of surgery. In the other patients hyperfibrinolysis was detected in 60% during the operation. However, therapy with an antifibrinolytic drug only was necessary in 40% of the patients. Our experience is summarised in an algorithm for ROTEM-based perioperative coagulation management for liver transplantation.","873":"The instability of the gestational and puerperal equilibrium of haemostasis is affected by a shift of primary and plasmatic haemostasis in a procoagulatory direction, whereas the regulation mechanism of the fibrinolytic system can easily cause disproportional peri- and postpartal reaction leading to massive haemorrhage. Peripartal injuries or an atonic uterus can lead to massive haemorrhage and cause a classic haemorrhagic coagulopathy. Complications like amniotic fluid embolism, puerperal sepsis, eclampsia or HELLP syndrome can lead through DIC to rapidly developing and possibly fulminant hyperfibrinolysis. This article depicts different forms of haemorrhage in the peripartal situation, their particular pathologies and specific possibilities for management. A case study demonstrates the diagnostic and therapeutic options in the case of eclampsia with early abruption of placenta.","874":"In trauma associated coagulopathy, the initial treatment consists of hypothermia and acidosis have to be treated aggressively. Already in in the emergency room, fibrinogen deficiency can be detected frequently, in addition, colloids interfere with fibrin polymerisation. Under these aspects, the early administration of fibrinogen seems to be justified. Depleted coagulation factors can be substituted with PPSB and\/or fresh frozen plasma, while in view of a risk of infection, retaining administration of platelet concentrates is indicated. The potential of using haemostatic agents like antifibrinolytics and DDAVP for this indication is only supported by few studies, although in individual cases it may be very helpful. The administration of recombinant FVIIa could not achieve sustainable amelioration of the outcome of trauma patients in a randomised controlled trial. Raising inhibitors of coagulation (antithrombin) simultaneously to antihaemorragic therapy is being discussed, but seems not reasonable in the acute phase of a life-threatening haemorrage.","875":"The variety of possibilities for medicamentous anticoagulation is constantly growing. Anesthesiologists and pain therapists are confronted with patients being treated with highly effective anticoagulatory or new antiaggregatory substances due to coronary heart disease, stroke or peripheral arterial disease. Especially these patients benefit from neuraxial blockades when undergoing cardiac surgery, revascularization surgery or amputations. The anaesthesiologist needs an overview concerning pharmacology, indications and side-effects of the anti- and procoagulatory substances and has to integrate this knowledge in the treatment concept to prevent haemorrhagic complications. This review depicts basics of coagulation, sites of action of currently applied anticoagulants and Austrian standards for performing modern central and peripheral nerve blocks under anticoagulatory medication. In general anaesthesia, too, the preoperative evaluation of preexisting anticoagulatory therapy is of high significance concerning the derivation of procedures for perioperative coagulation management. To prevent haemorrhagic complications in patients treated with anticoagulatory agents, recommendations concerning the following questions are given: time intervals between the application of anticoagulatory substances and punction, removal of catheters or general anaesthesia and operation; the choice and performance of the locoregional anaesthesiologic method and intraoperative coagulation analysis method; reversion of anticoagulation in acute situations.","876":"Elaborate measures for donor selection and the production of clotting factor concentrates have led to a high safety standard of these products. A multimodal approach to eliminate unwanted contents has been established by strict screening of possible donors and various inactivation procedures within the production process. The systematic registration of adverse events shows very few allergic and nonallergic reactions to plasma derived clotting factor concentrates. In none of the registered cases transmission of infections could be verified. The worldwide registration of such adverse events is not yet sufficiently established, since adequate structures are lacking in some countries. According to estimates, far less than half of occurring adverse events are registered in Germany. A European solution in the form of an official register is about to be introduced.","877":"Unexplained intraoperative coagulopathies continue to be a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma. The pathophysiology behind unexplained intraoperative coagulopathies is of great variety and complexity (preexisting coagulopathies, dilutional coagulopathy, interactions of medications etc.). We have shown in prospective studies that patients undergoing elective surgery who develop \"unexplained\" intraoperative coagulopathies have significantly less FXIII per unit thrombin available at any point in time (i.e. already preoperatively) than patients without such coagulopathies. The consequence is a significant loss of clot firmness associated with an increase in intraoperative blood loss. Thus, these patients have less cross-linking capacity to begin with, which explains their preoperatively increased fibrin monomer concentration. The association of increased preoperative fibrin monomer and increased intraoperative blood loss was prospectively evaluated and confirmed in a separate clinical study. It is important to note that the acquired or (compared to the amount of thrombin generated) relative F. XIII deficiency in situations with surgical stress shows early clinical relevance (even if only mild to moderate changes are present); this differs from the experiences with patients with inborn FXIII deficiency, where a pronounced deficiency must be present to have clinically significant spontaneous bleeding. Patients undergoing elective surgery, without clinically obvious coagulopathy but increased preoperative fibrin monomer concentration (as a marker of decreased crosslinking capacity) are at risk for increased intraoperative blood loss. This new concept helps to explain the pathophysiology behind unexplained intraoperative coagulopathies and thus allows for corresponding treatment strategies. Further clinical studies for early detection and interventions in patients with such coagulopathies are necessary.","878":"Guidelines of official societies for diagnosis and therapy of intraoperatively occurring hypocoagulability rely mainly on data of patients receiving whole blood transfusions. They recommend--provided that laboratory evaluation shows deficiency (values&gt;1.5 fold normal)--administration of fresh frozen plasma, cryoprecipitate and platelet concentrates (platelet count&lt;50,000 or &lt;100,000\/microl). This article describes the pathogenesis of coagulopathy in the light of the special intraoperative setting, emphasizes recent changes of blood component preparation, transfusion triggers, effects of volume therapy and challenges standard laboratory assays as reliable guide for intraoperative hemostatic therapy. The role of thrombelastographic monitoring is discussed as well as an alternative strategy to compensate deficiencies by the use of coagulation factor concentrates instead of or in addition to transfusion of FFP, a new concept which is illustrated by the presentation of an actual case report.","879":"Thrombelastometry\/-graphy provides information about clot strength and stability. Modified thrombelastometry\/-graphy improved standardisation and diagnostic information using this system. Heparinase modified thrombelastometry\/-graphy allows estimation of heparin. The introduction of FIBTEM on the ROTEM first allows a clear estimation of the plasmatic and the platelet component of clot strength, which may be of interest in managing haemostasis in perioperative setting. In this context the meaning of fibrinogen should be evaluated. As our clinical data show there is no predictive value of elevated D-dimers to hyperfibrinolysis in perioperative setting. However, thrombelastometry\/-graphy do not deteckt disturbances in primary haemostasis such as von Willebrand Syndrom. The effect of acetylsalicylacid and clopidogrel do not have any influence on thrombelastometry\/-graphy, as well. GPIIb\/IIIa-Antagonists such as ReoPro may reduce clot strength at high dosis. A similar effect may be expected in severe M. Glanzmann. The correlation between coagulation time in thrombelastometry\/-graphy (CT\/r-value) to conventional coagulation may be low because of different activators used. The introduction of rotationthrombelastometry (ROTEM) provides a stable system suitable for bedside-monitoring.","880":"When no fresh frozen plasma is available, acute major blood loss is compensated above all with crystalloids, colloids and red blood cell concentrates, meaning that all plasma clotting factors are diluted. Consumption coagulopathy is almost always accompanied by dilutional coagulopathy. Formulas for calculating critical blood loss and standard coagulation tests are often not helpful in the case of massive transfusion. On the other hand, systems suitable for point of care, such as thrombelastography, have important advantages. In the case of consumption and dilutional coagulopathy plasma coagulation is disturbed and critical values are first seen for fibrinogen. Not only is fibrin polymerization impaired by the bleeding-induced loss and dilution of fibrinogen, but also by interaction with artificial colloids, particularly hydroxyethyl starch preparations. Therapy of consumption and dilutional coagulopathy calls for fresh frozen plasma. If this is not available in sufficient quantity or within a reasonable time, coagulation factor concentrates must be used. Neither fresh frozen plasma therapy nor treatment with coagulation factor concentrates has been the subject of detailed clinical study. Further studies are needed to work out guidelines for coagulation management in the case of massive blood loss.","881":"Therapeutic angiogenesis is a novel promising strategy that uses angiogenic factors and stem cell transplantation to increase blood perfusion in ischaemic lower limbs. In preliminary studies short term safety and feasibility of gene therapy by recombinant protein administration or gene transfer were proven. Early reports mostly fail to show an convincing efficacy. In the largest placebo-controlled study of therapeutic angiogenesis in severe PAD reported to date, the plasmid-based fibroblast growth factor was safe and significantly reduced amputation rates. The data suggest the efficacy of the angiogenic therapy and provide the basis for further larger trials to confirm these first results.","882":"Platelet inhibitors and anticoagulants are used in the longterm treatment after successful infrainguinal bypass grafts as well as endovascular revascularisation procedures. However, evidence of the usefulness of these therapies is limited with respect to efficiency (patency rate, mortality) and safety (bleeding tendency) concerning these indications. Sufficient data are only available for acetylsalicylic acid treatment after implantation of prosthetic bypass grafts, the data basis for the use of antithrombotic medication in venous bypass grafts or following successful balloon angioplasty with or without stent implantation is, however, inconclusive. The recommendation for lifelong therapy with acetylsalicylic acid after infrainguinal bypass surgery and endovascular treatment is based mainly on the concept of prophylactic treatment of manifest atherosclerotic disease.","883":"Resistance to acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) or clopidogrel is understood from the clinical point of view as failure of the drugs to prevent recurrent vascular occlusions. Non-response to ASA and clopidogrel is defined from the laboratory aspect as an inability to cause in vitro detectable platelet function inhibition. It would be beneficial to monitor non-response to ASA or clopidogrel with platelet function methods, which detect the specific effect of these drugs, and thus prevent clinical events caused by failure of therapy. Non-response to ASA and clopidogrel are detected with different platelet function methods, which are not always clinically standardized and are assessing only the global platelet function and not the specific drug effect. Although various studies reporting 5 to 59% non-response for both drugs, support a clinical relevance of ASA and clopidogrel non-response, well-designed clinical prospective trials are required to identify patients with antiplatelet drug resistance. Furthermore, mechanisms explaining this phenomenon of drug resistance are still unknown.","884":"When assessing the quality of clinical trials in intermittent claudication, on principle the same strict biometric and medical standards need to be applied for studies on the effect of walking exercise as for conservative drug treatment studies. However, as demonstrated by a recent review of the Cochrane Collaboration, this is apparently not always the case. The review included ten randomized controlled studies published between 1966 and 1997 with a total of 258 patients. The exercise regimes varied considerably between studies with regard to mode, intensity, frequency, duration and supervision, just as the treadmill tests employed to measure walking distance and walking time, respectively (primary endpoint). None of these studies used a confirmatory approach, and they all have a number of further methodological flaws when taking current biometric and medical guidelines into account. Also unmentioned in the abstract remains the important fact that, owing to missing data, finally only 53 patients from three studies could be pooled for the actual meta-analysis. All in all, the Cochrane review under discussion here is hardly suitable to scientifically prove the generally accepted efficacy of walking exercise in intermittent claudication. At the same time, it becomes clear that even publications of well-reputed institutions such as the Cochrane Collaboration should always be critically scrutinized. On the other hand, applying modern guidance for investigation under the aspect of evidence based medicine must not lead to a retrospective discrimination of accepted historical scientific data and thereby call into question proven therapeutic strategies.","885":"In the view of the AkdA (Drug Committee of the German Medical Profession), the efficacy in intermittent claudication is currently proven only for Naftidrofuryl, whereas in the opinion of the DGA (German Society of Angiology) also that of prostaglandin E(1) is proven. Both drugs are indicated if neither walking exercise nor vascular or endovascular reconstruction are feasible. In critical limb ischaemia (Fontaine stage III\/IV), the efficacy of prostaglandin E(1) and iloprost is proven according to both the treatment recommendations of the DGA and the ACC\/AHA Guidelines. The AkdA also agrees with the administration of prostanoids, even though it considers their efficacy not sufficiently proven in accordance with CPMP criteria. Here, prostaglandin E(1) is approved for the treatment of Fontaine's stage III\/IV regardless of its etiology, whereas iloprost is approved only for the treatment of thrombo-angiitis obliterans.","886":"Catheter-based treatment of intraarterial thrombus can be used successfully as a treatment to recanalize acutely occluded native arteries or bypasses associated with acute limb ischaemia. It should be used if the ischaemia not already caused sensory and\/or paralytic disorders that require urgent open surgical treatment. Advantages of pursuing immediate angiography in patients with acute limb ischaemia include delineation of the limb arterial anatomy with visualization of both inflow and runoff vessels and clearing intraarterial thrombus from the distal runoff vessels. Thus, final treatment can be planned electively as an intervention of open surgery. A metaanalysis comparing lysis and surgery that included three randomized trials and case series concluded that lysis improved 6 to 12 months limb salvage and reduced mortality compared with surgery. The transformation of an acute arterial occlusion into a chronic one is not clearly defined. Thus, fibrinolytic therapy can be successfully used for occlusions supposed to be older than six months.","887":"With regards to the rapid progress of interventional therapy in the treatment of PAOD the revision of the published guidelines (TASC Recommendations 2000) is more than necessary. The current options in therapy are modified constantly. Therefore, published recommendations might be not up-to-date. In consideration of the number of interventions and operations which are performed throughout Europe a trend towards less invasive treatment becomes apparent. Guidelines and recommendations from the Charing Cross and the ACC\/AHA (ACC\/AHA Guidelines for the Management of Patients With Peripheral Arterial Disease 2005) are reflecting this development. Regardless of the complexity of the planned procedure interventional treatment is almost always first choice therapy. A yearly revision of the actual guidelines would be useful, leading to an up-to-date modality. Although in the diagnostic pathway MRI and CTA gain more importance, the gold standard in diagnosis of PAOD remains the standardised measurement of the walking capacity, ankle-brachial index (ABI) and duplex ultrasound.","888":"The high cardiovascular morbidity and mortality on peripheral arterial disease (PAD) are attributable to the pronounced tendency to generalization of the atherosclerotic process, the systemic progression of atherosclerosis. The crucial objective in management of a PAD consists in preventing systemic progression. The prognosis can be improved by early diagnosis and early prediction of individual risk with subsequent risk-adapted prevention and causal therapy. Early diagnosis and risk prediction are measures that are already part of the repertory of the general practitioner. Practicable and economically justifiable parameters that nevertheless have a high predictive value are therefore required to stratify individual risk. The vascular indicators ankle-arm index and the localization of the PAD as well as the classical cardiovascular risk factors including homocysteine are suitable. Weighting of these parameters in a multivariable risk score enable the population with the highest risk of early generalization of atherosclerosis to be identified in PAD.","889":"Mutations in factor-V- and factor-II-genes are correlated with an increased risk for venous thrombosis according to the literature. The significance of the mutations in factor- II- and factor-V-genes for the development of the peripheral arterial occlusive disease is not known. Therefore, we investigated the presence of these mutations in 152 patients with documented peripheral arterial occlusive disease and 318 controls without peripheral arterial occlusive disease with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). There was no association between factor-II-mutation and peripheral arterial occlusive disease. The factor-V-mutation, however, was increased in patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease double fold (12 positive cases in 318 controls, 12 positive cases in 152 patients with peripheral arterial occlusive disease). The significance level was reached (p = 0.05) in statistical analysis but the result did not fall below the significance level as necessary to reach statistical significance (odds ratio 2.19). Nevertheless, from these data we have to discuss a biological relevance of factor-V-mutation in the pathogenesis of peripheral arterial occlusive disease.","890":"The prevalence of the peripheral arterial disease (PAD) varies with the analysed population and the screening method. The prevalence of the symptomatic PAD, derived from questionnaires, ranges from around 1% within the 50 years-old up to 5% within the 80 years-old. Due to the low specificity of such questionnaires this method has lost its relevance. In epidemiologic studies determination of the ankle\/brachial index (ABI) is recommended for screening. ABI &gt;0.9 indicates PAD. Based on the ABI the prevalence of the PAD in Germany in women aged 45-49 years is 2.3% and in men 2.6%. It increases to 10.4% and 15.2% in 70-75 years old women and men respectively. Real prevalence of PAD is assumed to be even higher, because ABI determination is biased to select people with more severe PAD and misses those with excellent collateral perfusion. Patients suffering from PAD with a chronic critical limb ischaemia (CLI) are characterised by the worst prognosis regarding limb salvage and mortality. Although the exact prevalence of CLI is unknown, it is assumed that CLI affects more than 2% of all PAD patients.","891":"Coronary heart disease and the acute coronary syndrome are the leading causes of death in Germany. In prospective observational studies conventional risk factors such as smoking, arterial hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, and diabetes can explain over 80% of cardiovascular diseases. Therefore, cardiovascular diseases are potentially preventable. The basis of a rational primary prevention is a thorough estimation of the global vascular risk. The application of risk scores allows an estimation of a person's global vascular risk. Furthermore, the estimation of an individual global vascular risk enables to identify patients who profit from an additional medical treatment to control blood pressure, lipids, and platelet aggregation. Besides general preventive measures, strict guidelines for secondary prevention are pre-eminent for patients with known coronary heart disease, documented arteriosclerosis in other vascular regions or known diabetes. Patients with an acute coronary syndrome are at an increased risk. Therefore, guidelines for these patients are very strict. In general, the following applies to primary and secondary prevention of the acute coronary syndrome: Change in lifestyle and strict risk factor control improve the quality of life and prognosis when followed consequently.","892":"The major goal in the development of new anticoagulant drugs is a more effective action with less adverse effects. Until now the mainly used agents are heparin and phenprocoumon or warfarin. These drugs inhibit multiple coagulation factors in different stages of the coagulation cascade. Modern drug development and the knowledge about the molecular mechanisms of the coagulation cascade allow specific inhibition of distinct phases of thrombus formation. This review focuses on the new developments in this area.","893":"Rupture of an atherosclerotic plaque with subsequent thrombosis and myocardial ischemia is the patho-physiological mechanism in acute coronary syndromes. Tissue factor (TF) as the main initiator of the extrinsic coagulation cascade plays a central role in the pathogenesis of acute coronary syndromes. The extent of the thrombotic process is modulated by local vascular TF of the ruptured plaque as well as by circulating TF. In addition, TF alters signaling pathways and, thereby, contributes to inflammatory reactions and vascular remodeling. This review addresses current concepts of the role of TF in acute coronary syndromes and discusses potential consequences and therapeutic approaches.","894":"In patients with acute coronary syndrome (ACS), the periinterventional antithrombotic treatment has become increasingly important for the choice of reperfusion strategy and as an adjunct pharmacological treatment prior, during and after percutaneous coronary interventions (PCI). In NSTE-ACS and early invasive strategy (&lt;48 h), treatment with ASA, clopidogrel and heparin - unfractionated heparin (UFH) preferred - should be initiated as soon as possible. Direct thrombin inhibitors are an alternative to heparin, particularly in the setting of increased risk of bleeding and heparin-induced thrombocytopenia. In highrisk patients, an so-called upstream therapy with glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors (tirofiban, eptifibatide) is recommended as an adjunct to PCI. In STEMI, primary PCI is the reperfusion therapy of choice and should be supported by early adjunct treatment with ASA, clopidogrel, UFH and glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa inhibitors (abciximab, eptifibatide). \"Facilitated\" PCI with thrombolytics is not recommended because of increased mortality and complication rates.","895":"Thrombolysis is an established treatment of acute myocardial infarction with persistent ST elevation (STEMI). Thrombolytic agents are most effective in patients who can be treated within two hours of symptom onset. On the other hand, the efficacy of mechanical recanalization (PCI) was consistently shown to be superior to thrombolysis regardless of the duration of symptoms. Recent studies further suggest that it may be preferable for small hospitals to rapidly transfer patients with acute STEMI to a PCI center rather than perform on-site thrombolysis. Therefore, this novel strategy is principally recommended in the updated guidelines of German and international cardiac societies. However, it is emphasized that the transfer-related delay of treatment should not exceed 60-90 minutes.","896":"The endothelium is of important significance in the development of the acute coronary syndrome. As an endo-\/paracrine organ, the endothelium plays a key role in the regulation of the vascular homeostasis. The endothelial integrity and above all the bioavailability of nitric oxide (NO) are essential for the correct function of the endothelium. Cardiac risk factors may lead to an endothelial dysfunction with a consecutive imbalance of the vascular homeostasis. In an inflammatory or prothrombotic state the endothelium shows a number of abnormalities such as oxidative stress, expression of cell adhesion molecules, activation of cell signal-systems (renin-angiotensin-system, CD40\/CD40L-system) and especially the loss of NO. The inflammatory cascades lead to coronary atherosclerosis over years or, more instantly, to the acute coronary syndrome caused by endothelial erosion or the rupture of an instable plaque. The knowledge of the pathophysiological processes in the arterial wall during the acute coronary syndrome may lead to the identification of high risk patients and the development of more targeted therapies.","897":"The pathophysiology of the acute coronary syndrome is related to a vulnerable, inflammatory plaque promoting activation and aggregation of platelets. Therefore, the inhibition of platelet function is a primary goal of the treatment of the acute coronary syndrome. In recent years this field has made substantial progress, which is reflected by frequently updated treatment guidelines. New dose regimens and therapeutic strategies, but also innovative pharmacological principles evolved recently. Some of these novel drugs are currently tested in clinical trials. Increasing experience with the currently used platelet inhibitors also revealed potential shortcomings of these substances, such as drug resistance. This review will give a cardiological perspective of some important clinical aspects and new developments in the field of platelet inhibitors.","898":"Cardiovascular diseases, especially ischaemic heart disease, are actually the most frequent causes of death in the Western world and represent a central challenge for modern research and medicine. The pathophysiology of ischaemic heart disease is based upon the development and biological remodelling of atherosclerotic plaques. Mainly at late stages, but also in the early phase of atherosclerosis, rupture of the atherosclerotic plaque occurs and may lead to the clinical manifestation of acute coronary syndromes, including unstable angina pectoris, non-transmural or transmural myocardial infarction. Next to inflammation mediating cells like monocytes, platelets play an essential role at early and late stages of atherosclerotic disorders. This review summarizes the basic pathophysiological mechanism of platelet adhesion and secretion, the molecular steps involved in platelet mediated thrombus formation in the atherosclerotic microenvironment and the role of platelet accumulation in reperfused myocardium.","899":"Non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) is an acute life-threatening event which has a high rate of recurrence. Combined antithrombotic therapy (including cacetylsalicylic acid, clopidogrel, heparins and glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa receptor antagonists) substantially reduced major coronary events during the acute phase of coronary heart disease with a good tolerance because of the short duration of such aggressive strategy. The combined antithrombotic strategy also allows to increase the benefit of an early invasive strategy including coronary angiogram with stent percutaneous coronary angioplasty which recent trials have shown that to be preferable to a conservative approach in these high risk patients. Antithrombotic and antiplatelet therapy in association with coronary revascularization play an important role in the prevention of an adverse outcome. Recently, clopidogrel has been shown reduce recurrent ischaemic events, both early and during the first year after non-ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction. An ideal antithrombotic and antiplatelet strategy will reduce events before revascularization, enhance the revascularization procedure without excessive bleeding.","900":"Considerable progress has been made during the last years with the development of new antiplatelet and antithrombotic agents. The introduction of the ADP-antagonist Clopidogrel some years ago was the first alternative to oral acetylsalicylic acid for long-term treatment. Prasugrel, another ADP-antagonist, is currently in advanced stages of clinical trials. Regarding antithrombotic drugs the interest has been focussed on small molecule direct inhibitors of thrombin and factor Xa. (Xi)Melagatran is one of the recent developments in direct thrombin inhibitors, Dabigatran may follow soon. Several factor Xa inhibitors are currently subject to clinical trials, including Rivaroxaban; others may follow. From a pharmacological point of view these compounds are likely to improve and enlarge the spectrum of available antiplatelet and antithrombotic drugs, respectively.","901":"This article reviews the current understanding of the pathophysiology of acute coronary syndrome and how these concepts have altered our clinical approach to the acute phase of coronary heart disease. Thrombosis due to erosion or, in most cases, rupture of a vulnerable atherosclerotic plaque underlies most acute coronary syndromes. The protective fibrous cap undergoes degradative processes controlled by inflammatory mediators that break down the interstitial collagen within the fibrous cap. Thrombus formation depends on factors in the solid-phase of the ruptured plaque as well as on fluid-phase determinants in blood. Depending on the degree of thrombus formation the subsequent obstruction of the coronary artery is followed clinically by unstable angina, non-ST- and ST-segment elevation myocardial infarction.","902":"Thrombocytopenia is observed in 6 to 15% of pregnant women at the end of pregnancy, and is usually moderate. Gestational thrombocytopenia (defined as a mild thrombocytopenia, occurring during the 3 rd trimester with spontaneous resolution postpartum and no neonatal thrombocytopenia) is the most common cause of thrombocytopenia during pregnancy but a low platelet can also be associated with several diseases, either pregnancy specific or not, such as preeclampsia, HELLP syndrome, or idiopathic thrombocytopenic purpura (ITP). The differential diagnosis between ITP and gestational thrombocytopenia is clinically important with regard to the fetus, due to the risk of neonatal thrombocytopenia. However, this differential diagnosis is very difficult during pregnancy. Thrombocytopenia which need to be investigated are the following: thrombocytopenia known before pregnancy, thrombocytopenia occurring during the 1(st) and 2(nd) trimester, platelet count &lt;75 G\/l in the 3(rd) trimester or thrombocytopenia in case of pregnancy with complications. Investigations have to be discussed in function of history and clinical examination, gestational age and severity of thrombocytopenia. No treatment is required in case of gestational thrombocytopenia. There are few data to distinguish management of ITP between pregnant and non-pregnant women but management is different because of the potential adverse effects of the treatment for the woman and\/or the fetus, the requirement for a good hemostasis at delivery and the risk of neonatal hemorrhage. One important problem is that it is not possible to predict the risk of neonatal thrombocytopenia in babies born from women with ITP.","903":"Thromboembolic disease remains a leading cause of maternal mortality during pregnancy and the puerperium. Rational and risk-adapted administration of heparin prophylaxis depends on 1. the identification of those women who have an increased risk of thrombosis and 2. the accurate quantification of this risk. In women without prior thrombosis, the presence of a heterozygous factor V Leiden or heterozygous G20210A mutation in the prothrombin gene is associated with a pregnancy-associated thrombotic risk of approximately 1 in 400. Thus, in pregnant carriers of either one of these mutations the risk of venous thromboembolism is low. Therefore, no heparin prophylaxis is recommended. A combination of the two genetic risk factors can increase the risk to a modest level of 1 in 25. In women with a single episode of prior thrombosis associated with a transient risk factor, e.g. surgery or trauma, and no additional genetic risk factor, the probability of a pregnancy-associated thrombosis appears also to be low. However, data are sparse and conflicting. In contrast, in women with a prior idiopathic venous thrombosis who carry an additional hereditary risk factor or who have a positive family history of thrombosis, a high risk (&gt;10%) can be expected supporting the indication for active antepartum and postpartum heparin prophylaxis. Despite the remarkable progress in risk stratification, the absolute magnitude of risk and the optimal management in many cases is an issue of ongoing debate.","904":"Venous thromboembolism is the leading cause of pregnancy-associated morbidity and mortality. Women with thrombophilia have an increased risk of VTE in pregnancy and puerperium. In individuals with hereditary thrombosis risk factors a relative risk of pregnancy associated VTE ranging from 3.4 to 15.2 has been found. Women with previous VTE have an approximately 3.5-fold increased risk of recurrent VTE during pregnancy compared to non-pregnant periods. Data on the association of thrombophilia and pregnancy loss and pre-eclampsia are conflicting. Besides an established association with antiphospholipid antibodies, available data suggest associations for antithrombin deficiency, hyper-homo-cysteinemia, factor V Leiden, prothrombin G20210A variation and protein S-deficiency. A contribution of thrombophilia to the risk of pre-eclampsia is less well established. A limited number of prospective studies did not reveal an increased risk of pregnancy complications in unselected women with thrombosis risk factors. Data of only one controlled trial on the prevention of pregnancy loss with low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) are available, which revealed a strikingly positive effect. Thrombophilia screening might be justified in women with pregnancy loss and treatment with LMWH might be considered in those with pregnancy loss and thrombophilia. Further prospective studies and controlled interventional trials are urgently needed.","905":"Long-term inhibition of platelet aggregation is essential for the secondary prevention after acute coronary syndromes (ACS). Inhibition of platelet aggregation with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) has been established as a safe and effective therapy in this indication already end of the eighties in the preceding century. A decade later, with the introduction of the thieno-pyridines, combined platelet aggregation inhibition became possible. This opened the door for new treatment strategies in interventional cardiology. The first substance, ticlopidine was more or less replaced by the newer substance clopidogrel, which has improved pharmacological properties and less side effects. Low dose ASA (75 mg\/d) is still regarded as the standard therapy for secondary prevention after ACS. However, large clinical trials established clopidogrel as at least as effective and safe as ASA in this indication. Following PCI with bare metal stent implantation, a combined therapy of ASA and clopidogrel should be given for at least 4 weeks. After ACS with non-ST-elevation myocardial infarction the combined therapy with ASA and clopidogrel gives a better outcome than ASA alone. Recently published clinical trials show superiority of this strategy in patients with ST-elevation myocardial infarction, too. If a combined long-term platelet aggregation inhibition with ASA and clopidogrel will be safe and more effective for secondary prevention is discussed.","906":"Venous thrombosis is a chronic disease with a recurrence rate of approximately 30% within 5-8 years. The optimal duration of secondary thromboprophylaxis in these patients entails balancing the risk of recurrence against the risk of treatment-associated bleeding. There is agreement that patients with a first idiopathic venous thrombosis should receive vitamin K antagonists for at least 3-6 months. Convincing trials showing a clinical benefit in terms of morbidity or mortality with respect to expansion of anticoagulation beyond 6 months are lacking. Nevertheless, some subgroups of patients with venous thrombosis may benefit from indefinite anticoagulation. Thus, patients with antithrombin deficiency, combined or homozygous defects, more than one unprovoked episode of thrombosis, the lupus anticoagulant or high factor VIII plasma levels are good candidates for long-term prevention.","907":"Idiopathic venous thromboembolism has been shown to be associated with a high frequency of recurrence. Therefore, the most important aim of long-term treatment is secondary prevention. It has also been shown that long-term anticoagulation with vitamin K antagonists can impressively reduce the rate of recurrence. However, this effect was only maintained during anticoagulation and disappeared after cessation of anticoagulant therapy. Unfortunately, the individual risk of recurrence is not predictable. Therefore, longterm anticoagulation appears beneficial across all subgroups of patients suffering from venous thromboembolism, regardless of the presence of thrombophilia or other burden of the disease. Despite the increasing body of evidence regarding the advantages of long-term anticoagulation, bleeding complications may limit the net clinical benefit of this strategy. Thus, the development of anticoagulants having a low potential for adverse reactions and providing similar beneficial antithrombotic effects to vitamin K antagonists will enhance the readiness for their wide spread use and life long administration.","908":"Platelets constantly patrol the inner surface of blood vessels searching leaks to be sealed, in order to prevent blood loss. When they detect a vessel injury their action can be divided into three phases. ADHESION: The platelets adhere to the injured blood vessel wall via their receptors glycoprotein (GP) Ib and integrin alpha2bbeta3 (GPIIb\/IIIa) mediated by the ligands von Willebrand factor (VWF), fibrinogen and others. AGGREGATION: Platelets stick to each other through fibrinogen bridging integrin alpha2bbeta3 (GPIIb\/IIIa) on adjacent platelets. SECRETION: During activation the content of platelet granules is released by exocytosis, thus augmenting and propagating formation of a haemostatic plug or thrombus. Laboratory tests mimic one or several aspects of these three phases to obtain reliable data on a patients platelet function. In this overview assays, test principles, and pitfalls are presented.","909":"This is a very short review on quantitative coagulation factor assays for the beginner. For systematic training several excellent textbooks in German language are available. Quantitative functional assays of coagulation factors and of physiological inhibitor proteins are based on the principle of parallel-line or slope ratio bioassays. With the modern analyzers the test procedure follows the example of clinical chemistry: a single test plasma dilution read from an actual calibration curve, regular internal and external quality control. If there are unexpected results or a suspicion of haemophilia we recommend to repeat the assay with three different pre-dilutions of the test plasma. The resulting potency estimates should not deviate by more than 10-15% from their average. Otherwise the assay is invalid and requires further investigation (e.g. search for inhibitors). Special problems may complicate diagnostic activities. As an example discrepancies between factor VIII one-stage clotting and chromogenic assays are discussed.","910":"Global tests of haemostasis represent several reaction steps in the physiologic process of clotting. The proportion of plasma or whole blood in the test mixture of a global test is significantly higher than in clotting factor tests. Accordingly, the influence of preanalytical variables is strong, e.g. underlying diseases or drug effects. Strict adherence to preanalytical requirements is of utmost importance. Apart form the standardized reporting of the thromboplastin time (prothrombin time) as International Normalized Ratio (INR), results are generally not comparable when generated by using different reagents or instrumentation. Multiple potential influencing factors have to be considered when interpreting the results. Only laboratory requests precisely derived from the clinical situation can yield clinically relevant conclusions.","911":"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia is a strong risk factor for the development of arterial and venous thromboembolic events. In patients clinically suspected for HIT, immediate cessation of heparin treatment and continuation of anticoagulant treatment using alternative anticoagulants is mandatory in order to minimize the risk of thrombotic events. Alternative anticoagulants that have been successfully used in HIT include the direct acting thrombin inhibitors hirudin, bivalirudin and argatroban, and the heparinoid orgaran. In addition, there is growing evidence that the synthetic pentasaccharide fondaparinux is usable for the treatment of HIT patients. This short review summarizes the strategies of alternate anticoagulant treatment in HIT patients and also describes long-term treatment of HIT patients.","912":"Solving the human genome and new technical tools are nowadays rapidly increasing the knowledge of haemostasis. This includes the identification of novel genes, the understanding of complex phenotypes as thromboembolic disorders, the scientific exploration of the involved proteins by means of crystal structure, protein-protein-interactions and protein expression profiles as well as the development of new and more selectively acting anticoagulant drugs. The impact of haemostasis proteins in fields beyond haemostasis such as wound healing, angiogenesis, inflammation, immune system, and tumour growth is becoming more evident. Patients will profit from these developments by individualised prevention and therapy regimens, including future approaches of regenerative medicine as stem cell and gene therapy.","913":null,"914":"","915":"In the preceeding decades, our understanding of the complexity in our haemostaseologic system has been evolutionized from a purely ex vivo standpoint to an increasingly in vivo oriented approach, by more and more respecting the immense metabolic interactions of our vascular endothelium, mainly thrombin, the central serine protease in our coagulatory system. So far, investigations concerning human endothelium only relied on experiments with embryonic human endothelial cells, derived from umbilical cord veins. The underlying investigation confronts the justified question about the transferability of such embryonic results to the adult vascular system. Micro- and macrovascular endothelial cells were isolated, purified and propagated in pure cultures. Integrated into an established filtration model, their potential to mediate antithrombogenicity was investigated. Surprisingly, immense differences in thrombin-induced antithrombogenicity were demonstrated. This justifies doubts concerning the transferability of HUVEC-based results to the whole human vascular system. ","916":"Antibodies against annexin-V, a potent anticoagulant abundant in placental tissues, were recently controversially reported to be associated with recurrent miscarriages or failures of in-vitro-fertilization (IVF) attempts. We screened 56 women (34.7 +\/- 4.3 years of age: mean +\/- 1 SD) with recurrent IVF failures and\/or early pregnancy losses for resistance against activated protein C, lupus anticoagulant and antibodies against annexin V, cardiolipin or beta(2)-glycoprotein-1. Among them the prevalence of APC-R (8\/56, 14%) and elevated levels of IgG- or IgM-anti-cardiolipin antibodies (7\/56, 12%) were more common than elevated levels of (IgG or IgM) antibodies against beta(2)-glycoprotein-1 (3\/56, 5%) or annexin-V (1\/56, 2%). 42 (75%) of the women had another IVF-attempt after this haemostaseological evaluation and received low molecular weight heparin and\/ or acetylsalicylic acid in the case of positivity for APC-resistance, lupus anticoagulant or antibodies against annexin V, cardiolipin or beta(2)-glycoprotein-1. The outcome of these IVF-attempts were 19 pregnancies (34%): 4 early miscarriages (7%) and 15 so far uncomplicated pregnancies (27%). The only woman with an elevated anti-annexin V (IgG) level had had 7 IVF before and received 40 mg Enoxaparin (Lovenox) subcutaneously once daily during the 8(th) IVF, which resulted in a healthy pregnancy. Our findings suggest that among women with recurrent IVF failures anti-annexin V antibody positivity is less prevalent than APC-resistance, lupus anticoagulant (LA) or elevated levels of antibodies against cardiolipin, beta(2)-glycoprotein-1 and that the IVF-result of women with APC-R, LA or with elevated levels of antibodies against annexin V, cardiolipin or beta(2)-glycoprotein might be positively influenced by low molecular weight heparin. ","917":"Recurrent miscarriage is a heterogeneous condition. A large number of studies have suggested a significant role for inherited and acquired thrombophilia in the development of abortion. Preliminary case-control studies and one prospective trial suggest that low molecular weight heparin is effective in preventing pregnancy loss in women with thrombophilia and previous recurrent miscarriage.","918":"Many cancer patients have a hypercoagulable state, with recurrent thrombosis due to the impact of cancer cells and chemotherapy or radiotherapy on the coagulation cascade. Studies have demonstrated that unfractionated heparin (UFH) or its low molecular weight fractions interfere with various processes involved in tumour growth and metastasis. These include fibrin formation; binding of heparin to angiogenic growth factors, such as basic fibroblast growth factor (FGF2) and vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF); modulation of tissue factor; and perhaps other more important modulatory mechanisms, such as enhanced tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI) release and inhibition of various matrix-degrading enzymes. Clinical trials have suggested a clinically relevant effect of low molecular weight heparin (LMWH), as compared to UFH, on the survival of cancer patients with deep vein thrombosis. Similarly, the impact of warfarin on the survival of cancer patients with thromboembolic disorders was demonstrated. Studies from our laboratory demonstrated a significant role for LMWH, warfarin, anti-VIIa, and LMWH-releasable TFPI on the regulation of angiogenesis, tumour growth, and tumour metastasis. Thus, modulation of tissue factor\/VIIa non-coagulant activities by LMWH, warfarin, anti-VIIa, or TFPI might be a useful therapeutic method for the inhibition of angiogenesis associated with human tumour growth and metastasis. Additionally, antiplatelet drugs could have an impact on tumour metastasis, and the combination of antiplatelets and anticoagulants at adjusted doses might provide greater benefits to cancer patients.","919":null,"920":"Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is known for its marked heterogeneity which was already recognized by von Willebrand in 1926. The basis of phenotypic differentiation are quantitative and qualitative or functional differences between the different types and subtypes of VWD. Clinical relevant facts for the practitioner on diagnosis and therapy of von Willebrand disease and von Willebrand syndrome are presented.","921":"In the diagnosis of deep vein thrombosis in ambulatory patients, the recommended initial steps are assessment of clinical probability (CP) and a sensitive D-dimer test. With a low CP and negative D-dimer, thrombosis can be ruled out. All other constellations require further investigation with imaging techniques. Compression ultrasonography is the first-line investigation. Low-molecular weight heparin is the treatment of choice for uncomplicated venous thrombosis. Secondary prophylaxis with a vitamin K antagonist is introduced in parallel as quickly as possible. The duration of treatment depends on the exposure and predisposing factors, weighing carefully the risk of recurrence on the one hand against the risk of bleeding on the other. If there are contraindications to anticoagulation with heparins or coumarins, various other anticoagulant drugs are available.","922":"Fibrinolytic therapy still is a keystone in the therapeutic approach of acute occlusion in different vascular regions. However, before starting fibrinolytic therapy an evidence-based risk assessment is necessary. This article presents the most common fibrinolytic agents as well as evidences and recommendations for fibrinolytic therapy of different vascular regions.","923":"The term acute coronary syndrome (ACS) pertains to the instable and life-threatening forms of a clinically manifest coronary artery disease with biochemical and\/or electrocardiographic evidence od myocyte cell death. In detail, it includes the unstable angina pectoris, the non-ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (NSTEMI) the ST segment elevation myocardial infarction (STEMI) and as well the sudden cardiac death. As early reperfusion of ischaemic myocardium is the most effective way for limiting infarct size by restoring the balance between myocardial oxygen supply and demand, it is the most important therapeutic goal to achieve early and complete antegrade flow in the occluded or restricted vessel, related with a reduction of short and longtime complications as heart failure and severe arrhythmias. It is generally accepted, that the primary percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI) is the method of choice in acute myocardial infarction (STEMI) to restore TIMI-3 blood flow in occluded coronary arteries, if this can be performed within two hours of symptom onset and by a highly specialized team. Since this requirements are only met in 20% of hospitals caring for patients with STEMI in Germany, the therapy with thrombolytic and anticoagulant agents plays still an important role. Apart from a rapid and effective prehospital primary care, it depends furthermore on a differentiated anticoagulatory and antithrombotic therapy during coronary intervention to get optimal results.","924":"Proteolytic factors belonging t the plasminogen activator family (plasmin, u-PA, t-PA, u-PAR, PAI-1, and PAI-2), which usually are involved in blood clotting and degradation of blood clots, are also present in healthy and diseased tissue of the kidney, lung, liver, gastro-intestinal tract, breast, prostate, ovary, and brain. These factors are engaged in brain development, angiogenesis and vascular invasion, wound healing as well as in placenta development and embryogenesis. Plasminogen activators u-PA and t-PA, their inhibitors PAI-1 and PAI-2, and the u-PA-receptor (u-PAR, CD87) are often elevated in solid malignant tumour tissues compared to their normal counterparts. In breast cancer patients, an elevated tumour tissue extract antigen content of u-PA, PAI-1, and u-PAR is associated with increased tumour aggressiveness and poor prognosis; in contrary, an elevated content of t-PA and PAI-2 indicates a favourable prognosis. For clinical relevant determination of these proteolytic factors in tumour tissue extracts, only enzymo-immunometric tests (ELISA) are recommended. Enzymometric and enzymographic tests are actually conducted only in an experimental, preclinical context.","925":"The ecarin chromogenic assay (ECA) was developed for quantitative determination of direct thrombin inhibitors. As a further development of the ecarin clotting time (ECT), the ECA is based on the same principle, the activation of prothrombin by ecarin a snake venom from Echis carinatus. In the ECA the prothrombin activation products meizothrombin and meizothrombin-desF1 cleave a chromogenic substrate, whereas in the clotting assay ECT plasma fibrinogen is converted to fibrin. The activity of meizothrombin\/meizothrombin-desF1 is inhibited in a concentration-dependent fashion by direct thrombin inhibitors. The ECA can be used as ECA-H for quantitative determination of hirudin and as ECA-T for determination of synthetic thrombin inhibitors. As shown for hirudin, argatroban and melagatran, the ECA turned out as a very precise and sensitive method, which combines the advantages of ECT with those of chromogenic assays. In ECA very low interindividual variations were found compared to aPTT and even ECT. The ECA is independent of the variations of the coagulation variables prothrombin and fibrinogen.","926":"Due to the manifold functions of tissue factor (TF), also tissue factor pathway inhibitor (TFPI), its endogenous antagonist, is of interest. For the determination of TFPI, either its antigen concentration or its activity can be measured. A chromogenic assay for the functional determination of TFPI is presented and modified for its application in the routine laboratory. Its suitability for daily use was evaluated by testing more than 7000 plasma samples from a heparin study in healthy volunteers. In addition, our data confirm that the method records the activity of both free- and lipoprotein-associated TFPI. The chromogenic assay proved to be rapid and easy to perform and features a high reproducibility. Due to excellent correlation of the results with the total TFPI antigen concentrations, the method represents a more rapid and economic alternative to the determination of total TFPI antigen by ELISA in plasma samples after heparin application. ","927":"In contrast to low molecular weight heparin and unfractionated heparin fondaparinux is a selective synthetic factor Xa inhibitor. It was approved for thromboprophylaxis after major orthopaedic surgery three years ago. Because of its excellent bioavailability after subcutaneous application once daily independent of body weight (within the range of 50-100 kg) monitoring of the substance is usually not necessary. Since its recent approval for therapeutic use in acute venous thrombosis monitoring might be useful in special clinical situations (e. g. suspected over- or underdosing, renal insufficiency or severe bleeding complications). Based on standard laboratory methods for the chromogenic determination of the anti-factor Xa activity of low molecular weight heparin several chromogenic substrate assays were published for monitoring. Only fondaparinux should be used for calibration and measured fondaparinux levels should be expressed in mug\/ml of the fondaparinux calibrator. Because of its single synthetic chemical entity, a linear dose\/response relationship over a wide concentration range is observed and measurements are of high precision.","928":"Anticoagulation during renal replacement therapy is recommended to avoid thrombosis of the filter devices and to maintain the blood flow. However, in the case of multiorgan failure and sepsis, an imminent bleeding complication in patients with acute renal failure may cause the need for an extracorporeal circulation without anticoagulation. The most common drug used in renal replacement therapy is the unfractionated heparin (UFH). With low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) good experiences are reported, too. Based on the level of evidence from clinical studies plasma measurement of heparin is indispensable for patients with renal insufficiency. The activated whole blood clotting time (ACT), the activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT), and the determination of the anti-factor Xa activity (anti Xa) with chromogenic substrates are available as routine as well as as point-of-care tests. To monitor plasma levels of LMWH the anti Xa assay serves exclusively as a suitable monitoring. The anti Xa assay using chromogenic substrates is the most specific and valid one for monitoring heparin therapy. In lack of large controlled studies for the anticoagulation therapy and its monitoring with the anti Xa test in acute renal failure, the current experiences are based on the results of chronic renal replacement therapy.","929":"The structure-activity relationship of dipetalogastin II, the strongest thrombin inhibitor isolated and cloned from the bug Dipetalogaster maximus, was examined by introducing gradual changes into the molecule by means of molecular biological methods. The effect upon its inhibition equilibrium constant was determined after each change by a chromogenic assay. This structural information was fundamental to design new dipetalogastin II-derived inhibitors. Our results suggested that the acidic sequence DEHDHDFEDT corresponding to amino acid residues 49 to 58 of dipetalogastin II reacts with the anion binding exosite (ABE) 1 of thrombin. Based on this finding, we constructed a chimeric molecule consisting of the active site blocking segment of dipetalogastin II (amino acid residues 1 to 48) and the ABE 1 blocking segment of hirudin. This construct showed better thrombin inhibitory activity than both separated segments only after the introduction of a glycine linker between both blocking segments. We thus obtained a thrombin inhibitor called dipetarudin with an inhibition equilibrium constant comparable to that of dipetalogastin II and a molecular mass below that of dipetalogastin.","930":"Chromogenic peptide substrates were developed more than 30 years ago. Although the use of chromogenic substrate methods in coagulation and fibrinolysis diagnostics was not as rapidly implemented as initially believed, they are now well established for several analytes such as antithrombin, FVIII, protein C, plasminogen, plasmin inhibitor, heparins, and pentasaccharides. The advent of direct thrombin and factor Xa inhibitors has stimulated the development of new, specific chromogenic methods and these may find their way into routine use if these new drug candidates will prove to be valid replacements for coumarin derivatives. A large number of chromogenic research methods for other analytes were developed, too. The current interest in global chromogenic methods for thrombin generation and the protein C pathway may turn out as clinically important and thus enter into routine use.","931":"","932":"Low molecular weight heparin offers several advantages concerning therapeutic efficacy and safety as compared to unfractionated heparin. Due to renal clearance of low molecular weight heparin problems with the use of low molecular weight heparins may occur in patients with renal failure. Current experience using low molecular weight heparin in patients with renal failure is based on single-dose pharmacokinetic studies, on retrospective analysis and on non-randomized prospective studies. Large randomized studies investigating the use of low molecular weight heparin (e. g. in acute coronary syndrome) have excluded patients with renal failure. Based on the findings mentioned above, treatment with low molecular weight heparin in patients with severe renal failure should follow only under special conditions. In moderate to severe renal failure monitoring anti-Xa activity may be useful to avoid bleeding complications. A definite cut-off level for a potential increase of bleeding complications with the use of low molecular weight heparins in renal failure has not been defined.","933":"Replacement therapy of coagulation factor preparations (AT, FFP, PPSB, FXIII, rFVIIa) are frequently used on the Intensive Care Units. Indications, dosage, specific effects and side effects have to be considered.","934":"In patients with chronic liver disease profound coagulation changes and thrombocytopenia may lead to life-threatening bleeding that requires thorough diagnosis and immediate blood product replacement.","935":"A minority of patients presenting with acute life threatening syndromes characterized by severe bleeding episodes or microvascular thromboses on the intensive care unit. Especially patients with TTP, HUS, acquired haemophilia and CAPS have a poor prognosis. These emergency cases require a rapid diagnosis and an immediate onset of treatment.","936":"Based on the increasing knowledge of defects in haemostasis in patients with sepsis as well as on the non-conclusive results of studies which tried to increase the prognosis by modulating cytokine response of the patients, in the last years the impact of therapeutic modulation of coagulation in sepsis has been investigated. In contrast to the results of phase III studies with the coagulation inhibitors antithrombin and tissue factor pathway inhibitor recombinant human activated protein C (rhAPC) resulted in a significant reduction in mortality for the whole study population. Data analyses showed, that treatment with rhAPC was clinically beneficial especially in patient groups who showed a high mortality in the placebo arm. Inhibition of thrombus formation due to the therapy with natural coagulation inhibitors resulted in an increase of sepsis-imminent haemorrhage, which became significant in some studies. Treatment with antithrombin and heparin resulted in a considerable increase in bleeding complications and on the other hand, may have antagonized the expected effect of antithrombin on the patient's prognosis. Some results suggesting beneficial effects of heparin on patient prognosis in the placebo arms and on the other hand negative effects of heparin in the verum arms -- especially with antithrombin or tissue factor pathway inhibitor -- let to a controversial discussion of the risk\/benefit relation of heparin, given in prophylactic doses to patients with severe sepsis. Whereas the impact and optimal application of heparin to patients with severe sepsis needs to be clarified study results with rhAPC resulted in the approval of this therapy and the implementation in the guidelines of the treatment of patients with severe sepsis.","937":"Coagulation activation with intravascular fibrin formation is a general finding in patients with sepsis. Low coagulation factors may be caused by disseminated intravascular coagulation, as well as by loss of plasma and impaired hepatic synthesis in the course of sepsis. The leading clinical symptom in consumption coagulopathy is bleeding. Therefore, treatment mainly consists of substitution of coagulation factors and platelets. Meningococcal and pneumococcal, as well as some other infections may lead to sepsis-induced purpura fulminans, a condition associated with microvascular thrombosis, necrosis, and haemorrhage. A typical laboratory sign is a very low plasma protein C level. Treatment with protein C concentrate or recombinant activated protein C (Drotrecogin alfa, activated) has been shown to be beneficial in sepsis-induced purpura fulminans. Unfractionated heparin or low molecular weight heparin has been recommended for prophylaxis of venous thrombosis, but there are no clinical studies specifically on patients with sepsis. Antithrombin concentrate is used in patients with antithrombin deficiency treated with heparin for acute venous thrombosis or embolism, extracorporeal circulation procedures or other invasive procedures. There is no indication for general use of antithrombin concentrate in patients with sepsis even in patients with low plasma antithrombin levels. Drotrecogin alfa, activated, is used for treatment of patients with severe sepsis. Its use is not limited to patients with sepsis-induced disseminated intravascular coagulation, although these patients appear to benefit especially from this therapy.","938":"Within the recent years preclinical and clinical investigations to a great extend increased the pathophysiological understanding what is going on in patients with severe sepsis. It became evident, that not the initiating infection by itself is the main reason for the severity and limited prognosis in sepsis. More important is the unbalanced reaction of the patient's organism to this infection, which is reflected in a mainly cytokine driven inflammation, the so called systemic inflammatory response syndrome, with its consequences. In the context of this syndrome released mediators, in part together with toxins from infectious microorganisms, result in a systemic activation of haemostasis. In the centre of our pathophysiologic model are the activations of the monocyte\/macrophage-system and of the endothelium. This results in the activation of plasmatic cascades including the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems. The observed activation of haemostasis and inhibition of fibrinolysis in patients with sepsis by themselves interact with leukocytes and endothelium and play an important role in the progressive derangement of microcirculation. This is clinically reflected in organ dysfunctions. Within a single individual patient there is increased fibrin formation, decreases in coagulation factors, inhibitors and platelets, as well as defects of the fibrinolytic system in parallel that may clinically result in disseminated intravascular coagulation with the risk of bleeding complications in addition to organ dysfunctions.","939":"Although prehospital cardiac arrest has an incidence of 40-90\/100,000 inhabitants per year, there has been a lack of therapeutic options to improve the outcome of these patients. Of all cardiac arrests, 50-70% are caused by acute myocardial infarction (AMI) or massive pulmonary embolism (PE). Thrombolysis has been shown to be a causal and effective therapy in patients with AMI or PE who do not suffer cardiac arrest. In contrast, experience with the use of thrombolysis during cardiac arrest has been limited. Thrombolysis during cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) acts directly on thrombi or emboli causing AMI or PE. In addition, experimental studies suggest that thrombolysis causes an improvement in microcirculatory reperfusion after cardiac arrest. In-hospital and prehospital case series and clinical studies suggest that thrombolysis during CPR may cause a restoration of spontaneous circulation and survival even in patients that have been resuscitated conventionally without success. In addition, there is evidence for an improved neurological outcome in patients receiving a thrombolytic therapy during during CPR. A large randomized, double-blind multicenter trial that has started recently is expected to show if this new therapeutic option can generally improve the prognosis of patients with cardiac arrest.","940":"The antiphospholipid syndrome is defined as the occurrence of one or more episodes of vascular thrombosis and\/or miscarriage together with antiphospholipid antibodies. Some of these antibodies can be detected via coagulation assays by prolonging phospholipids-dependent assays. These unspecific inhibitors are termed lupus anticoagulant, due to their first description by Conley and Hartmann in patients with disseminated lupus erythematosus. Lupus anticoagulants are now defined as acquired autoantibodies directed against a phospholipid-binding protein such as beta2-glycoprotein I or prothrombin. Because of this binding, lupus anticoagulants form bivalent complexes which slow down coagulation reactions in vitro by forming stable complexes on coagulation active phospholipids. In vivo, these complexes may result in cellular activation and cause thrombosis. Laboratory diagnosis for the lupus anticoagulant should be performed by a combination of tests, including phospholipid-dependent clotting assays, plasma mixing studies, and demonstration of the phospholipid-dependency of the inhibitory activity.","941":"Platelets are cells with key function in primary haemostasis. They localise coagulation to the haemostatic thrombus. After injury of the vessel wall blood contacts subendothelial matrix proteins as well as cells constitutively exposing tissue factor (TF). Platelets adhere to the subendothelial matrix, become activated, spread and secrete the contents of their granules. On the surface of the TF exposing cells minute amounts of thrombin are formed. These amounts of thrombin are inadequate to yield in a stable fibrin clot, but activate platelets and factors XI, VIII, V. In that way the consolidation pathway is triggered. Activated platelets aggregate and bind leukocytes. On the surface of the activated platelets coagulation (co)factor complexes are formed and protected in an optimal way. Thus large amounts of prothrombin are converted to thrombin, creating a so-called thrombin burst. This leads to the formation of a stable platelet-fibrin-clot. Platelets are not always prothrombotic. They have their own mechanisms to stop activation processes and thrombus growth. Besides, its key role in haemostasis platelets are involved in inflammation and innative immune defence.","942":"Leukocyte recruitment to sites of inflammation, infection or vascular injury is a complex event that is orchestrated by a tightly coordinated sequence of interactions between leukocytes and cells of the vessel wall, especially endothelial cells. These interactions are controlled by the expression and activation of various adhesion receptors and protease systems. This review will focus on novel aspects of the regulation of integrin-dependent leukocyte adhesion by haemostatic factors. Here, so-called non-haemostatic properties of endogenous proteins such as high molecular weight kininogen, urokinase receptor, urokinase, as well as plasminogen and its cleavage product angiostatin in leukocyte adhesion and transmigration will be summarized. The crosstalk between haemostatic factors and inflammatory reactions may contribute to a better understanding of inflammatory vascular disorders and to the development of novel therapeutical concepts.","943":"The concomitant activation of the immune response and the coagulation system in response to injury represents a phylogenetic old and adaptive principle already present in the early eukaryotic development. The close connection between coagulation, inflammation, and immune defense has been conserved during evolution and can still be found in humans in a number of physiologic reactions to potentially detrimental effects.","944":"Diabetic retinopathy is the most common microvascular complication in diabetes mellitus, mostly determined by chronic glycaemia as measured by HbA1c. The sequence of events involves changes in the cellular crosstalk of the retinal capillary, initiated by the loss of intramural pericytes. Data from transgenic and diabetic models allow to assess the relative importance of this phenomenon. New insight into biochemical and cell biological interactions from hyperglycaemia to vascular injury establish metabolic signal blockers as novel therapeutic approaches for diabetic microangiopathy.","945":"Among all exogenic factors nutrition has a most relevant impact on the haemostatic system and related cardiovascular and thrombotic disease. Whereas obesity and high-caloric diet are associated with negative changes of mostly all parameters of haemostasis, fibrinolysis and platelet reactivity, weight reduction and lifestyle modification induce respective beneficial effects. Recent studies demonstrate large evidence for the beneficial effects of a mediterranean diet in thrombotic diseases not mediated by cholesterol or weight reduction. The principal sources of fat within this diet, olive oil and omega-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids from fatty fish, nuts, seeds, and vegetables show a variety of beneficial effects on the haemostatic system in experimental and observational studies. Furthermore, for an increasing number of substances such as plant-based polyphenols and for moderate alcohol consumption attenuation of coagulation and platelet reactivity have been demonstrated. In the clinical context, mediterranean diet may exert its beneficial effects through synergistic action on haemostasis, endothelial function and vascular inflammation.","946":"Recent advances in the diagnosis and the treatment of acute coronary syndromes (ACS) have led to a substantial reduction of major coronary events, to an improvement in patient outcome, and to the definition of new guidelines. Current strategies for the treatment of patients with non-ST-elevation ACS recommend a combined antithrombotic therapy (including acetyl salicylic acid, clopidogrel, low-molecular weight or unfractionated heparins and, eventually glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa receptor antagonists). This combined antithrombotic therapy allows to increase the benefit of an early invasive strategy including coronary angiogram with stent percutaneous coronary angioplasty. The purpose of this review is to discuss and highlight the actual recommendations for the appropriate use of antithrombotic strategies for ACS patients.","947":"Topics of this survey are the indications and use of plasma-derived and recombinant coagulation factor concentrates. These substitution therapies need to be handled carefully by weighing up their effectiveness against the long and short term side effects in the individual patient.","948":"A survey is given on pharmacology and indications for the treatment with vitamin K antagonists. The therapeutic handling and self control by the patient is described.","949":"Direct and indirect coagulation inhibitors are used to inhibit the activity of the serine proteases of the coagulation system. Indirect inhibitors act via antithrombin and heparin cofactor II. The main representatives are heparins, lowmolecular-weight heparins, fondaparinux, idraparinux and danaparoid. They bind to antithrombin and potentiate the inactivation of factor Xa and other serine proteases. Direct thrombin inhibitors bind reversibly to thrombin without cofactor. Anticoagulants are determined by global and specific anticoagulant methods. New anticoagulants are developed such as oral factor Xa inhibitors, oral thrombin inhibitors, antibody against activated factor VII, recombinant tissue pathway inhibitor to improve inhibition of blood coagulation or to induce nonanticoagulant effects (e. g. activated protein C in septicaemia). New anticoagulant methods are developed to improve and specify the anticoagulant effect of anticoagulants in thromboembolic diseases.","950":"A survey is given on the clinical important haemostatic facts and diseases in gynaecology and obstetrics from the viewpoint of the gynecologist and obstetrician.","951":"Acquired coagulopathies regularly result from underlying diseases such as liver failure or sepsis. Optimal treatment of these underlying diseases defines longterm prognosis. In a few coagulopathies, such as immunocoagulopathies, in a relevant portion of patients an underlying disease cannot be identified. Therapeutic modulation of haemostasis aiming at the prevention of fatal bleeding or thromboembolism is able to improve the prognosis of patients with acquired coagulopathies. Most often this is the result of individualized, lab-controlled treatments, which are difficult to be studied. Within the last years the role of therapeutic modulation of haemostasis to reduce mortality was successfully studied for the first time in the frame of randomized placebo-controlled phase III studies.","952":"A survey on definitions, epidemiology, clinical manifestations of congenital thrombophilias and clinical relevant acquired thrombophilias is given. Diagnostic and therapeutical strategies are presented.","953":"This review focuses on symptoms, course and treatment of bleeding disorders due to hereditary coagulation factor deficiencies and acquired inhibitors, mentioning as well the pathophysiologic and molecular genetic aspects and diagnostic particularities. The review of haemophilia A and B deals with carrier problems, replacement therapy, additional haemostatic agents such as antifibrinolytics and desmopressin, the treatment of typical haemorrhages, haemophilia with inhibitors and future therapeutic options. Of the autosomal homozygous bleeding disorders such as von Willebrand disease type 3, afibrinogenaemia, factor XIII-, VII- and XI-deficiency each has its particularities influencing treatment strategies. The last chapter discusses acquired bleeding disorders such as acquired haemophilia A, von Willebrand disease, factor V deficiency and the hypoprothrombinaemia lupus anticoagulant syndrome, the different modes of inhibition, diagnostics and principles of treatment.","954":"Platelet plug formation is initiated by the process of platelet adhesion, mainly mediated by the von Wille-brand factor (VWF). Therefore, apart from established criteria the platelet adhesion property is a further criterion to determine VWF e. g. in diagnosis and treatment of von Willebrand disease (VWD). The new platelet retention test Homburg (RTH) is designed to close this gap. It is characterized by its non-thrombogenic filter with interconnecting pores, which retains platelets from blood when pressed through this filter due to the resulting shear stress. The RTH, in particular, proved to be highly sensitive in detecting the platelet adhesive property of VWF after its release from endogenous storage sites by desmopressin or infusion in VWD patients or its supplementation in vitro.","955":"Platelet ADhesion Assay (PADA) is a POCT capable method for quantitative determination of platelet adhesiveness. Using special polymer particles and test conditions adjusted to the physiologic conditions, the current functional state of blood platelets is determined directly from a whole blood sample. Within a short time, using little technical equipment and small sample volume, a therapeutic drug monitoring of GP IIb\/IIIa and ADP receptor antagonists is possible, too. Whereas in healthy volunteers dose\/effect curves of GP IIb\/IIIa antagonists vary only slightly, in thrombopilic patients there are big variations. Differences in efficacy up to drug resistance may occur also in use of the ADP receptor antagonist clopidogrel. A therapeutic drug monitoring of GP IIb\/IIIa- and ADP receptor antagonist therapy is essential and becomes feasible using PADA, also as long-term drug monitoring of ADP receptor antagonists and detection of drug resistance. Additionally, an individual ex vivo dose estimation for GP IIb\/IIIa antagonists is possible. PADA allows diagnostics of pathological platelet function in thrombophilic patients as well as long-term therapeutic drug monitoring due to its simple handling.","956":"In 1974 Wu and Hoak described a method for determining circulating platelet aggregates. This method was modified by Grotemeyer in 1983. The platelet reactivity index (PR) is based on the ratio of platelet aggregates in blood samples obtained in different buffer solutions. Platelet aggregates are resolved, when blood is sampled in EDTA-buffer, but remain fixed when EDTA-formalin-buffer is used. Generally, the PR is preferred, because in vitro manipulations of platelets are not necessary, and the results are estimated automatically. PR values above 1.05 are suspicious for elevated platelet aggregation. PR values above 1.2 indicate pathological changes in platelet aggregation. The PR is inexpensive (4.0 D ) and rapid to perform. PR-values were used successfully to identify non-responders to secondary prophylaxis with acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), i. e. patients suffering from stroke (33%) and after cardiac ischaemia (18%). Furthermore, elevated PR-values correlated significantly with the incidence of arterial thromboembolic complications. The PR correlated well in a own prospective study (drug monitoring) with values received from the retention test Homburg (RT-H) and the platelet function analyser (PFA-100). These data indicate that the values of the PR seems to be highly predictive for the evaluation of the ASA therapy. However, the PR is not suitable for the determination of ASA overdosage.","957":"Platelet function analyses were known as mystified, complicated, and time consuming laboratory investigations with a high coefficient of variation. Only in rare cases they led to precise interpretations under routine clinical laboratory conditions. In the first line they were focussed on bleeding tendencies. Only few were suited to evaluate the state of hyperaggregability of platelets. This short presentation of the GTH-Symposium 2004 gives a survey on the most simple and practicable tests for checking platelet function which may be used for the monitoring of therapy with tienopyridines and glycoprotein IIb\/IIIa-receptor antagonists.","958":"Several studies have demonstrated with the use platelet function tests (PFT) that subgroups of patients under acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) fail to produce the anticipated antiplatelet effect. This phenomenon as well as the clinical failure of ASA to protect patients from thromboembolic complications has been termed ASA resistance (AR) or ASA nonresponsiveness. Several subtypes of AR can be distinguished by PFT. The following PFT were used to characterize AR: optical aggregometry, platelet aggregation in whole blood, platelet function analyzer (PFA-100), platelet reactivity test or platelet aggregate ratio, flow cytometry and thromboxane B(2) generation. All PFT have in common that their widespread clinical use is substantially limited due to complex preanalytic factors, reduced specificity and poor reproducibility. PFT are not interchangeable for monitoring antiplatelet treatment. Three prospective clinical trials revealed a possible relationship between AR and subsequent cardiovascular events. There is a need for a simple and reliable assay for predicting the clinical efficacy of antiplatelet therapy. Recent data demonstrate that none of the currently available assays including the PFA-100 system are capable to accomplish these objectives.","959":"In this survey, the requirements for platelet function analysis are reviewed from a haemostaseologist's point of view. Problems and difficulties in platelet function diagnostics, i. e. in the methods and procedures used for measurement are described. Although drugs that interfere with certain parts of platelet function become more and more precise, we did not succeed in treating the patient with the optimal drug and in monitoring its efficacy accurately. A new quality of drug therapy is to be reached in order to immediately recognise idio-syncrasies, toxic reactions or drug induced side effects. For this, in time POCT methods should be used by medical staff. Furthermore, the methodical range of haemostaseologic laboratories should guarantee a high quality in acute and long-term drug monitoring.","960":"During the last few years, the availability of endothelial cell cultures isolated from different vascular regions contributed to a significant increase in understanding the complex pro- and antithrombotic mechanisms in our circulatory system. The most important key enzyme is thrombin. Due to its haemostatic properties this serin protease catalyzes fibrin formation, activation of factors V, VIII and XIII as well as irreversible platelet aggregation. These processes may occur even within the circulatory system in case of endothelial stimulation (e. g. by inflammation mediators) for expression of binding sites for factors IX, IXa, X, Xa, von Willebrand protein and PAF. Thus not only catalytically activated coagulatory cascades, but also enhanced cooperation of platelets and granulocytes will occur. Paradoxically, in low intravascular concentration, thrombin, in combination with a healthy endothelial layer, may be the critical factor for the inhibition of thromboses. Respective antithrombogenic properties will mainly affect pre-venous microvascular circulation. In detail, they include thrombin-induced endothelial formation of antiaggregatory autacoids from platelet release products, anticoagulatory activation of protein C and absorption of active coagulation factors at endothelial heparan\/ATIII complexes as well as release of profibrinolytic plasminogen activator of endothelial origin. The understanding of these complex regulatory functions enables not only a critical evaluation of actually discussed haemostasiologic risk factors (enhanced platelet reactivity, high concentrations of factor VII, VIII, fibrinogen, PAI, ATIII), but also the development of new pharmacologic strategies for prevention of thrombosis.","961":"Gene therapy is a new therapeutic approach which is tested in numerous diseases connected with either non or only limited therapeutic effects. This paper aims at discussing the actual state of the clinical development of gene-therapy which targets an approval by either the FDA or EMEA. Basis of all the figures and tables presented is a BioMedNet\/Medline search reviewing all titles found under the keywords gene therapy and\/or clinical development. The review period begins in the year 1992 and ends in 2002. Publications identified were sorted into the following categories: therapeutic areas with gene therapy activities; indications and diseases with gene-therapy activities; vectors used in gene therapy and clinical studies using gene therapy. Only in some indications like breast cancer, colorectal cancer, HIV, and cystic fibrosis a variety of clinical studies had been published indicating a serious attempt to develop the indication for approval. But most developments are still in phase I\/II. In all other therapeutic areas no systematic continuous approach was identified. Clinical activities in cardiovascular diseases and in peripheral vascular diseases increased during the preceding five years compared other therapeutic areas.","962":"There is sound evidence, that low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) administered subcutaneously is at least as effective and safe as an i.v. infusion of unfractionated heparin. Thus, with LMWH out-patient treatment of deep vein thrombosis (DVT) becomes feasible. According to the current guidelines, an objective diagnosis of DVT is required before the anticoagulation with heparin is initiated. Close monitoring is also required during the subsequent initiation of treatment with vitamin K antagonist. Contraindications and comorbid conditions need to be identified and may necessitate hospital treatment. A checklist may assist in the decision for or against out-patient treatment, but an individual assessment for the individual patient is always a requisite.","963":"Clinically overt, preoperative, disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) is not common in patient with aortic aneurysm. However, cases with large and expanding aneurysm are especially prone for this coagulopathy. Contrary to the clinically overt form compensated DIC in patients with aortic aneurysm seems frequent and is probably underdiagnosed. The compensated DIC may be recognized, even without bleedings, by laboratory tests documenting the activated coagulation and fibrinolysis. We show that in about one third of patients with abdominal aorta aneurysm (AAA) compensated DIC can be identified. This enables the application of preoperative anticoagulation treatment to improve the intraoperative haemostasis.","964":"Determination of the conditions for good acute and long term results of interventional therapy of lesions of the thoracic aorta using stent-grafts. 51 patients with aneurysm of the thoracic aorta (type B dissections) covered rupture and aortobronchial fistula were evaluated. All cases were discussed in an interdisciplinary conference consisting of thoracic surgeon and interventional radiologist. Primarily, 20 patients were operated and 31 were treated by intervention. For all a multidetector row CT angiography was ordered prior to the discussion. All procedures were performed in a DSA suite under general anaesthesia. In 29 patients Talent LPS trade mark tube grafts and in four patients an Excluder trade mark graft was implanted. 29 patients had an aneurysm of the thoracic aorta, 21 a type B dissection, 19 a perforation and one patient had an aortobronchial fistula. The follow up was 13.4 months. In 29 patients the stent-graft implantation was successful, in 2 patients stent-graft delivery failed due to severe calcification and kincking of both common iliac arteries. One patient had an iliacal dissection after stent-graft delivery which was treated successfully by surgery. In two patients CT angiographic control detected endoleaks, which were treated with a second stent-graft placement. One patient with an acute perforation of the descending aorta died due to cardiac failure prior to stent-graft implantation. Any neurological complication did not occur. Percutaneous treatment of lesions of the descending thoracic aorta using stent-grafts is a safe and feasible alternative treatment to surgical repair. Prior to the a multidetector row CT angiography is necessary for exact planning of the endo-luminal treatment. ","965":"A screening program for infrarenal abdominal aortic aneurysm (AAA) has limited cost-effectiveness. Yet, screening of the subpopulation of smoking men aged 60-75 years, or men and smoking women with a family history of vascular diseases or other cardio-vascular co-morbidity is cost-effective and has been demonstrated. It is suited to halve the increasing mortality of AAA. Elective repair of AAA is justified at diameters larger than 5.5 cm for men, but uncertain for women. However, aortic diameters between 4.5 and 5 cm in women probably necessitate an invasive approach. Surveillance of patients who still not meet these criteria should not only include the absolute diameter of the aneurysm, but direct individuals with aneurysms at an annual expansion rate of more than 0.5 cm to elective repair.","966":"Popliteal artery aneurysms (PAA) are a dangerous complication of general atherosclerosis or other diseases. PAAs with a diameter of less than 2 cm are observed despite the fact that small aneurysms may also result in peripheral embolism. The spectrum of complications in the course of the disease ranges from multiple embolism into the crural arteries or complete thrombosis of the popliteal artery associated with complete ischaemia. Rupture is rare even in large aneurysms. Interventional therapy using covered stents does not lead to results comparable with surgery and is not considered as standard therapy. Surgical technique in asymptomatic aneurysms includes resection\/exclusion of the PAA with reversed vein PI-PIII vein bypass. In case of acute ischaemia the therapy has to be modified according to anatomic aspects and has to be combined in some cases with intraoperative lysis. Amputation rate may be as high as 40%. Large aneurysms (&gt;3 cm) should be treated by aneurysmorrhaphy or resection with graft interposition rather than simple bypass. In our study with short follow-up only 3 of 10 patients were asymptomatic. Survival rate, limb salvage and patency amounted to 100%.","967":"","968":"The determination of D-dimer concentration is an essential part in the diagnostic procedure of thromboembolic diseases, e.g. deep vein thrombosis, pulmonary embolism. D-dimers are the products of fibrin hydrolysis with elevated levels in fibrinolytic processes. In the clinical practice problems exist in the interpretation of increased D-dimer concentrations, especially without thromboembolic disease. Before starting further expensive imaging diagnostics other reasons (i.e. pregnancy, neoplasma, systemic inflammatory disease, advanced arteriosclerosis) should be considered in differential diagnosis. The determination of the concentration of D-dimers is involved in the diagnostic strategy in thromboembolic diseases. However, this parameter is not suited for routine screening. Its high predictive-negative value is proved for the exclusion of thrombosis or pulmonary embolism in case of negative test result. Since a range of diseases and physiological conditions lead to increased D-dimer values, a positive D-dimer result does not verify the diagnosis of thromboembolism. ","969":"Heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) type II is an antibody mediated severe adverse event to heparin with a paradoxical decrease of platelet count and an increased risk for thromboembolic complications. The antibodies are directed against a neoepitop of platelet factor 4 after its binding to heparin. The incidence of HIT type II is lower with low-molecular-weight heparin compared to unfractionated heparin and lower in not operated patients compared to those after major surgery. In patients with HIT type II alternative anticoagulation has to be performed immediately due to the high thrombogenicity of the antibodies. The recombinant hirudin lepirudin (Refludan) is the anticoagulant drug of choice. A long-term anticoagulation has to be performed depending on the concomitant risk factors, intravenous administration followed by subcutaneous lepirudin overlapping with vitamin K antagonists.","970":"A survey is given on the peculiar characteristics of laboratory methods for analyzing the blood coagulation system with special regard to the pre-analytical, the analytical and post-analytical phase. Routinely used methods are described as well as test combinations for the diagnostic of some characteristic coagulopathies.","971":"As in adults, haemorrhagic or thrombotic events may also occur in children. The underlying reasons are inborn or acquired. Inherited disorders usually present during in early infancy. In order to interpret clinical and laboratory findings in children it is necessary to keep in mind some specific paediatric features. This knowledge also forms the basic requirement to choose the appropriate therapy.","972":"Genetic defects of fibrinogen are caused by a broad spectrum of mutations in one of the three structural genes FGA, FGB and FGG. They result in complete or partial lack of plasma fibrinogen (a- or hypofibrinogenaemia) or in structural abnormalities affecting protein function (dysfibrinogenaemia). In contrast to afibrinogenaemia mainly caused by nonsense, frameshift, and splice site mutations resulting in substantially truncated polypeptide chains (mainly Aalpha), in hypo- and dysfibrinogenaemias missense mutations lead to the exchange of single amino acids as dominating underlying defect. In the cases with quantitative disorders, bleeding with various degrees of severity is generally observed. Dysfibrinogenaemia is associated with both bleeding or thrombosis or even a combination of haemorrhagic and thromboembolic symptoms. About one half of the dysfibrinogenaemic cases is clinically asymptomatic. The plasmatic factor XIII (FXIII) is a heterotetramer composed of two A and two B subunits encoded by two different genes. FXIII deficiency is associated with bleeding, wound dehiscence and recurrent spontaneous abortions. The most frequent form is caused by defects in the A subunit with a broad spectrum of underlying mutations. Defects of the B subunit are very rare and were molecularly elucidated in only a few cases.","973":"Molecular genetic aspects of the inherited bleeding disorders haemophilia A and B, deficiencies of factor VII and X are described. The spectrum of the mutations is characterized. For genetic counselling the X-chromosomal inheritance of haemophilia and the principles of the indirect and direct genomic diagnosis are explained. Clinics and genetics of the rare inherited bleeding disorders known as factor VII and factor X deficiency are summarized. The mutations spectrum, the role of polymorphisms, the bleeding pattern and genotype-phenotype relations are described.","974":"The principles of initiator and amplification reactions of blood coagulation and fibrinolysis will be presented and discussed in relation to various regulatory pathways of haemostasis. In particular, cell surface-dependent activation and inhibition reactions are characteristics of multi-component enzyme complexes that also allow the endogenous physiological control of the haemostasis system. The understanding of these relationships in complications of haemostasis has led to different available strategies for the therapeutic intervention with pro- and anticoagulant substances.","975":"","976":"","977":"Stem cell transplantation associated microangiopathy (TA-TMA) occurs in about 7% of all transplantations. While it resembles in all its features idiopathic TTP or HUS, response to plasma therapy is poor. The overall mortality of patients afflicted with TA-TMA is about 80%. Comparative studies aimed at discovering risk factors for the development of TA-TMA and defined different entities according to clinical, laboratory and outcome parameters. It is thought to be of multifactorial aetiology with the central event of endothelial damage. Intensive chemotherapy and radiation for bmt-preparation, infection in the immunocompromised host and graft versus host disease in conjunction with immunosuppressive therapy i. e. cyclosporine turn the haemostatic balance into a procoagulant state. Therapeutic strategies deduced from idiopathic TTP were disappointing with the only consensus in the withdrawal of cyclosporine from TA-TMA patients. Future trials are directed to ameliorate endothelial dysfunction.","978":"Thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP) is a micro-angiopathic disease due to deficiency of the specific VWF cleaving protease (VWF-CP) ADAMTS13. The acquired form is caused by autoantibodies against VWF-CP, whereas mutations of the ADAMTS13 gene are responsible for inherited TTP. In childhood both forms exist with predominance of inherited TTP. The phenotype of TTP in childhood can be rather variable. Besides the classical clinical picture, abortive forms may occur that can delay the identification of patients at risk. The patients are frequently assumed to suffer from idiopathic thrombocytopenia (ITP) or Evans syndrome. Further efforts are necessary to accelerate correct diagnosis and to establish a risk-adapted prophylactic therapy.","979":"As hallmark of TTP, generalized hyaline thrombi in the patient's microcirculation is known. These thrombi are composed of platelets and VWF. A severe defect of the VWF cleaving protease (VWF-CP) was found in all known patients with the inherited form of TTP. In contrary, although a severe deficiency of VWF-CP is specific for the acquired form, too, only a fraction of these patients is characterized by a severe deficiency. In most patients with a severe deficiency autoantibodies directed against VWF-CP is detectable in plasma. However, many patients with acquired TTP do not show any severe deficiency. Because treatment differs in inherited and acquired forms and as persistance of autoantibodies during clinical remission is of prognostic value, the determination of the activity of VWF-CP and of antibodies against VWF-CP are important parts in the workup of patients with TTP. In all methods for the determination of the activity of VWF-CP the first step is proteolysis of a specific substrate for the protease. In the second step the activity of the protease is measured by analysis of the residual VWF multimers, by the generation of specific fragments, by using the residual VWF:CB or VWF:RCo as marker of the loss of multimers or with help of specific monoclonal antibodies. In less than 30 min the cone and plate(let) aggregometer helps to distinguish between different forms of thrombotic microangiopathies. While adhesion and aggregation of platelets from a healthy person are clearly enhanced after addition of a small amount of plasma from a TTP patient, both characteristics are weakened by plasma from patients with other forms of thrombotic microangiopathy (dilution effect). Molecular genetics are established methods in the differentiation between inherited and acquired forms of TTP in those cases without autoantibodies against VWF-CP.","980":"During the last couple of decades improved pathophysiological insight, use of improved diagnostic tools, and improved understanding of treatment requirements, have converged on an improved safety of treatment and quality of life for the patient suffering VWD. The scientific development in this area has elucidated a vast heterogeneity in VWD now appreciated as a vastly heterogeneous group of bleeding disorders. In some subtypes, dysfunctional VWF protein characteristics are clarified and logically linked with the distinct site of the VWF gene mutation abolishing specific functions of VWF, while in other subtypes such relationships have not yet been established. With the most frequently occurring variant, designated type 1, the quantitative loss in VWF seems to correlate with its reduced function. However, we are only at the beginning of the era of molecular genetics of this specific variant. Medical evidence based guidelines by ordinary standards for treatment of VWD do not exist. Therefore, treatment is based on a mechanistic approach and empirical knowledge. The review presented here focuses on the management of bleeding in VWD. Its basis is a mixture of data reported to literature and the authors' personal clinical observations. Our intention is the presentation and discussion of current issues related to VWD as well as the various pharmaceutical treatment options available for patients afflicted with von Willebrand's disease, together with some theoretical thoughts on possible future modalities.","981":"The acquired von Willebrand syndrome (AVWS) is a rare bleeding disorder with laboratory findings similar to those for congenital von Willebrand disease. Unlike the congenital form, AVWS usually occurs in individuals with no personal or family history of bleeding. Large studies on AVWS are not available, diagnosis remains difficult and treatment empirical. Acquired von Willebrand syndrome is especially frequent in lympho- or myeloproliferative disorders. It is associated with solid tumours, immunological and cardiovascular disorders as well as other miscellaneous conditions. Diagnosis of AVWS is based on assays measuring ristocetin cofactor activity or collagen binding, which are usually abnormally low, while factor VIII coagulant activity is some-times within the reference range. FVIII\/VWF inhibiting activities are found in only a minority of cases. Bleeding episodes in patients with AVWS are mostly of the mucocutaneous type and can be managed with desmopressin, plasma-derived factor VIII\/von Willebrand factor (FVIII\/VWF) concentrates and intravenous immunoglobulin. Recombinant activated factor VII can be useful in cases unresponsive to standard therapy. In conclusion, the AVWS, although rare, is certainly underestimated in clinical practice: The actual clinical impact of AVWS should be evaluated by prospective studies. The authors are co-ordinating an updated version of the International Registry on AVWS that will allow data to be entered directly online.","982":"The clinical presentation of VWD shows sex-related differences of symptoms. In women the most typical symptoms are menorrhagia, bleeding during and after delivery or abortion and bleeding in connection with caesarean section or gynaecological surgery. Menorrhagia is one of the most common symptoms presented to gynaecologists. In 7-20% of menorrhagia the underlying cause is VWD, in our cohort of 185 women with menorrhagia the prevalence of VWD was even 32%. On the other hand in women with VWD menorrhagia with onset at the menarche can be found in 60-93%, influencing substantially their morbidity and quality of life. During pregnancy women with mild VWD experience a decrease of bleeding tendency due to an increase of endogenous VWF. But as the VWF concentration drops rapidly after delivery, the post-partum period is often associated with significant bleeding complications. In severe forms of VWD the bleeding risk is high during delivery and postpartum period. Laboratory monitoring and therapeutical measures should be continued for 8-10 days after delivery. During menopause the clinical situation improves for most of the women with mild or moderate VWD.","983":"Due to the multifunctional character of von Willebrand factor (VWF), its complex biosynthesis and structure, many different disease causing molecular mechanisms exist which explain the well known marked heterogeneity of clinical symptoms in von Willebrand disease (VWD). Identification of specific mutations that can either cause complete or partial absence of VWF, interfere with post-translation processing of VWF like dimerisation and multimerisation, impair intracellular transport or disturb particular functions of VWF, offered the opportunity for structure\/function studies of VWF and genotype\/phenotype analysis of VWD. Today the molecular tools for such studies are readily available, enabling us to identify the molecular defects in a reasonable time even in the case of the large and complex VWF gene with its 52 exons. Mutation analysis can help to find the correct diagnosis and to classify patients with VWD which may be crucial to choose the adequate therapy. It can also identify unaffected carriers of the disease gene among family members of patients with VWD. Furthermore, mutation analysis and the conclusions drawn from such data can further help to understand the molecular mechanisms of VWF not only in bleeding but also in arterial thrombotic disease.","984":"Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is known for its marked heterogeneity which was already recognized by von Willebrand in 1926. The basis of phenotypic differentiation are quantitative and qualitative or functional differences between the different types and subtypes of VWD. One of the most important tools in the classification of VWD is multimer analysis that visualizes many of the structural abnormalities of mutant VWF. The introduction of multimer analysis was followed by the identification of an increasing number of different VWD phenotypes that were first reviewed in 1987 by Ruggeri and Zimmerman, thus forming a first classification of the disease. However, the detection of additional phenotypes required a revision of the nomenclature at a time point when only a few types of VWD had already been analyzed on the molecular level. Consequently, the molecular data only played a minor role in the revised classification published by Sadler in 1994. The advent of molecular techniques provided the opportunity for genotype\/phenotype studies which recently helped not only to elucidate or confirm important functions of VWF and its steps of post-translational processing but also many disease causing defects. The reproducible correlation between certain phenotypes and particular mutations can now be used for a molecular approach towards a soundly based classification of VWD, equally useful for the clinician and for research requirements.","985":"Von Willebrand disease (VWD) is caused by quantitative and\/or qualitative defects of the von Willebrand factor (VWF), a multimeric high molecular glycoprotein. Typically, it affects the primary haemostatic system, which is reflected by a mucocutaneous bleeding tendency simulating a functional platelet defect. The VWF promotes its function in two ways: It promotes platelet adhesion to the injured vessel wall under conditions of high shear forces and it functions as carrier for factor VIII in plasma. Due to its complexity diagnosis of VWD is one of the most challenging of coagulation disorders. The stepwise diagnosis of VWD includes patient's and family history, orientating procedures (bleeding time, filter tests, platelet count, aPTT), confirmatory tests (VWF:Ag, VWF:RCo, VIII:C) and tests for final classification (VWF:CB, RIPA, multimeric analysis, bWF:FVIIIB, platelet VWF). Accumulating knowledge of the different clinical phenotypes and their pathophysiological basis was translated into a classification scheme that differentiated between quantitative and qualitative defects by means of quantitative and functional parameters and by analyzing the electrophoretic pattern of VWF multimers. The advent of molecular techniques provided the opportunity for genotype\/phenotype studies which recently helped not only to elucidate or confirm important functions of VWF and the steps of its posttranslational processing but also many disease causing defects.","986":"The process of platelet thrombus formation contributes to the haemostatic response that prevents excessive blood loss after tissue injury, but may become a life-threatening disease mechanism by causing the acute thrombotic occlusion of atherosclerotic arteries. The participation of platelets in the formation of thrombi is centered on their adhesive properties and the ability to respond to stimuli with rapid activation. Platelet adhesion and activation are multifaceted and modulated by different environmental conditions, suggesting that it should be possible to obtain a selective pharmacological inhibition of the pathways more relevant to athero-thrombosis than to haemostasis. In particular, progress in understanding the structure and function of von Willebrand factor and the mechanisms that underlie its interactions with vascular surfaces and platelets can elucidate important differentiating aspects of normal haemostasis and pathological arterial thrombosis.","987":"Cardiovascular disease, to which venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism contribute a major part, are the leading cause of death in industrialized countries. Thrombosis is caused by temporary risk factors or by thrombophilia. Increasing knowledge concerning the pathophysiology of thrombosis and new diagnostic tools allow a thrombotic risk assessment. In this paper thrombotic risk factors will be discussed with respect to their significance and diagnosis as well as methods of prophylaxis and treatment for patients at risk for or with diagnosed thrombosis. Furthermore, currently available as well as new anticoagulants (pentasaccharide, melagatran) will be discussed and their potential for patient-oriented and cost-efficient prophylaxis and treatment of thromboembolic complications outlined.","988":"Irrespective of their mechanism of action, anticoagulants reduce the formation and action of thrombin. Thus they interfere with a final step in coagulation. Among platelet inhibitors only the GPIIb\/IIIa antagonists inhibit the common pathway of aggregation, namely the formation of platelet-to-platelet bridges which are mediated by fibrinogen or von Willebrand factor. In contrast, acetylsalicylic acid (ASA), NSAIDs, clopidogrel (Plavix) or ticlopidine (Tyklid) inhibit platelet activation by abrogating the formation or action of a secondary platelet agonist, namely of thromboxane A(2) or ADP. They do not block platelet aggregation which is directly induced by thrombin. Therefore, ASA, clopidogrel, or ticlopidine are not associated with a significant risk of bleeding as long as other factors such as an extensive thrombocytopenia or anticoagulation are not involved. Therefore, in contrast to anticoagulants, therapeutic drug monitoring is not necessary with ASA, clopidogrel, nor ticlopidine. On the other hand, ASA has even to be applied at a dosage that almost completely inhibits thromboxane synthesis in order to act on platelet aggregation at all. Among the GPIIb\/IIIa-antagonists only parenteral drugs have been approved for therapeutic use, e. g. abciximab (ReoPro), eptifibatide (Integrilin), and tirofiban (Aggrastat). Clinical studies revealed an increased risk of bleeding without a sufficient therapeutic benefit of oral GPIIb\/IIIa antagonists. GPIIb\/IIIa antagonists may induce thrombocytopenia that is attributed to an out-side-in signalling or immunological phenomena. A test system (Ultegra, Accumetrics) is available for a therapeutic drug monitoring of GPIIb\/IIIa antagonists. However, estimation of the bleeding risk always requires an evaluation of all factors influencing the haemostatic system, especially when heparin or other inhibitors are applied additionally.","989":"A survey is given on congenital and acquired platelet functional disorders. Congenital platelet functional disorders are extremely rare. Acquired platelet functional disorders are probably the most frequent disturbances of haemostasis. The knowledge of the defects leading to inherited platelet function disorders much improved our understanding of platelet function in general. Acquired platelet functional disorders are due to various diseases and drugs.","990":"An overview is given on congenital and acquired thrombocytopenias, their pathophysiology, symptoms, diagnosis and therapy with emphasizing heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and the thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura (TTP).","991":"This article reviews the roles of blood platelets in different physiologic and pathologic processes in the human body. Besides the basic processes in primary haemostasis, platelet adhesion, platelet secretion, platelet aggregation, clot retraction, the new model of thrombin formation on the platelet surface is presented. The different signal transduction pathways in platelets are a main focus of this review.","992":"Cryoprecipitate is the principal type of factor VIII (FVIII) concentrate used for treating haemophilia A in Tunisia. Allergic reactions, viral transmission, and inhibitor formation remain the most serious complications of FVIII therapy. The aims of the study presented here were to evaluate the efficacy of FVIII therapy, to investigate the inhibitor prevalence, and the factors which may affect inhibitor formation in our haemophilia A patients. Plasma samples were screened for FVIII inhibitors by the Bethesda method. 30 minutes FVIII recovery was also determined for each patient. In this prospective study, 18 previously treated haemophilia A patients, four with severe (FVIII concentration &lt;2%) and 14 with moderate haemophilia, were closely followed up during administration of 223 FVIII concentrates (cryoprecipitate and\/or fresh frozen plasma). The median age of the patients involved in the study was 13.5 years (range 5 to 53). Clinical response to FVIII was consistently good to excellent. In the majority of cases, actual and predicted FVIII recovery correlated' well. Adverse reactions were not observed. Five patients, aged less than 18 years and minimally treated (&gt;36 FVIII exposure days), were found to have low titre FVIII inhibitors (&lt;10 Bethesda units) at the end of the study. Inhibitor activity was detected in one patient with severe and in four patients with moderate haemophilia. In conclusion, FVIII therapy was effective, well tolerated, and low titre inhibitors identified did not preclude continued on demand FVIII therapy. Our study has also demonstrated that patients' age and treatment regimen do not affect inhibitor formation. Further studies are necessary to confirm these findings.","993":"We describe a 67-year-old patient with polycythaemia vera and pathological functional platelet studies. He not only suffered a transient ischaemic attack despite taking of antiplatelet agents, but also showed bleeding diathesis with cerebral bleeding and spontaneous suffusions. Platelet function studies and clinical findings improved after phlebotomy and cytoreductive treatment with hydroxyurea. Thrombosis and haemorrhage account predominantly for morbidity and mortality in patients with polycythaemia vera. The pathophysiological mechanisms to explain thrombosis and bleeding in patients with myeloproliferative disorders including polycythaemia vera were intensively studied. However, up to now no clear correlation of laboratory findings in relation to clinical history of thrombosis and bleeding was demonstrated. In this report the most important pathophysiological mechanisms and therapy with antiplatelet agents are discussed.","994":"This case report of a school boy with a history of severe and repeated episodes of epistaxis presents a short overview of the clinical and laboratory findings which lead to confirm the suspected diagnosis of von Willebrand disease (vWD). Suspicion of defective primary haemostasis should arise when unusual (because of their number or duration) mucosal bleeds appear in an otherwise normal and healthy patient. Because of its definitive inhibitory effect on platelet aggregation, acetylsalicylic acid (more than other non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs exerting unselective inhibition of cyclooxygenase) is a strong factor in triggering or sustaining the bleeding disorders in these patients. Among the congenital disorder of primary haemostasis, vWD is by far the most frequent one. The difficulties of laboratory diagnosis of vWD are stressed; the promises and pitfalls of new in vitro methods for measuring primary haemostasis (PFA-100 analyzer) are discussed. An accurate diagnosis of the specific type of vWD is of critical importance for correct patient management as well as for genetic counseling.","995":"Recurrent thromboembolism despite oral anticoagulation is primarily suspicious of overt or occult neoplasia. We report on a man (age: 67 years) who presented with severe thrombophilia which was only controlled when the patient was set on a combined anticoagulation with low molecular weight heparin in supratherapeutic dosage and phenprocoumon with a target INR of 2.0. Despite repeated evaluation over about two years, a malignant tumour could never be demonstrated. However, the patient suffered in addition to a protein S deficiency from an antiphosphospholipid syndrome and a chronic myelomonocytic leukaemia. We postulate that the accepted strong thrombogenicity of antiphosphospholipid syndrome was further increased by protein S deficiency and a possibly procoagulatory effect of the abnormal monocytes explaining the severe thrombophilia resistant to standard therapeutic anticoagulation with a vitamin K antagonist and usual therapeutic doses of low molecular weight heparin, respectively.","996":"We report on a man (age: 49 years), who died from severe meningococcal sepsis with disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC), multiple organ dysfunction syndrome and extended skin necrosis. We discuss in detail the pathophysiology of the activation of coagulation and fibrinolysis during sepsis. The article discusses new therapeutic concepts in the treatment of disseminated intravascular coagulation in meningococcal sepsis, too.","997":"We present a woman (age: 57 years) with an excessive bleeding episode under acetylsalicylic acid after bone marrow puncture due to an acquired von Willebrand syndrome (avWS) in the context of a myeloproliferative disorder. The laboratory features showed a high platelet concentration and a qualitative defect of von Willebrand factor (vWF) with a low normal vWF ristocetin cofactor activity, a normal vWF antigen and a decrease of the larger vWF multimers in plasma. The exact mechanism of avWS is still incompletely resolved. Myeloproliferative diseases are one of several underlying disorders that may cause avWS. The diagnosis of the underlying disease is important because its treatment may lead to an improvement of the vWF abnormality. For symptomatic treatment of bleeding, desmopressin, vWF concentrate infusion, intravenous immunoglobulin and\/or fibrinolysis inhibitors can be tried.","998":"We describe the case of a 30-year-old woman with homozygous prothrombin G20210A transition and heterozygous FV Leiden mutation and a history of postpartum venous thrombosis. Despite the high thrombotic risk to be assumed in the presence of this combined thrombophilia our patient suffered her first venous thrombotic event only at the age of 29 years during the puerperium of her first pregnancy. This fact supports the concept of venous thrombosis as a multicausal disease, with interaction of genetic and acquired risk factors. The case presented also stresses the importance of performing complete thrombophilia investigation.","999":"We report on two men with severe and recurrent bleeding episodes under well performed phenprocoumon therapy. Both patients showed an INR value within the therapeutic\/subtherapeutic range with an inappropriately prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT). The vitamin K-dependent coagulation factors were in the expected range, except for factor IX, which was as low as in moderate haemophilia B. After substitution of vitamin K, factor IX and the aPTT recovered completely in one case. In the other case factor IX was not measured but aPTT normalized. Diagnosis of an increased sensitivity of factor IX to phenprocoumon was assumed and proven in both cases by the demonstration of a missense mutation at ALA-10 in the factor IX propeptide.","1000":"A boy (age: 7 1\/2 years) with acute lymphoblastic leukaemia developed thrombosis of the sinus sagitalis superior with secondary haemorrhagic infarction while on induction treatment with vincristine, prednisone, and asparaginase. Based on this report, the potential pathogenic mechanisms are discussed with respect to congenital prothrombotic defects as well as to the role of antileukaemic treatment. Current hypotheses on mechanisms for thromboembolism in children and proposed prophylactic strategies are briefly summarized.","1001":"We present the case of a woman (age: 64 years) with acute thrombotic microangiopathy due to severe acquired ADAMTS-13 (von Willebrand factor-cleaving protease) deficiency. She was successfully treated with plasma exchange therapy and glucocorticosteroids. She relapsed seven months later, and splenectomy led to lasting remission. Pathomechanisms of thrombotic thrombocytopenic purpura, especially the role of ADAMTS-13, are discussed and therapeutic measures outlined.","1002":"This report describes the clinical history and laboratory findings of three sisters with severe inherited factor VII deficiency. We present current knowledge about factor VII structure and function, and discuss clinical presentation as well as management options for patients affected by factor VII deficiency.","1003":null,"1004":"Increasingly, endovascular therapy of the superficial femoral artery (SFA) is performed using stent technology. Not only short stenoses, but also longer lesions are receiving primary endovascular treatment, although several randomized studies have shown that stenting the SFA does not improve the prognosis after PTA of lesions of this size. Rather, the stent is indicated as a secondary measure to preserve the PTA-result should complications such as a dissection occur. New technical developments such as nitinol stents, sirolimus or PTFE coated stents offer the prospect of treating more complex SFA lesions (TASC Typ C). However, randomized studies reporting long term results with such stents have yet to be published and any cost-benefit analysis of stent therapy is questionable due to lack of pertinent data. Adjunctive techniques such as laser or brachytherapy have not shown convincing improvement of endovascular SFA therapy. Compound intervention carries the risk of injury to the branching profunda or the popliteal segment, which can transform an otherwise relatively harmless SFA occlusion into a lesion which may endanger the extremity. Furthermore, increasing complexity of the SFA lesion or lesions in diabetic patients result in markedly worse results when stented, in contrast to treatment employing bypass surgery. Applying evidence based criteria to treatment recommendation shows that primary stent-PTA of the SFA is, in most cases, medically and economically unjustifiable.","1005":"Stenoses and occlusions of the femoral artery mainly cause claudication. Their course is often silent and patients notice it by chance or in a medical checkup. Mayor amputations are rare in isolated femoral appearance of PAOD (peripheral arterial occlusive disease). Although conservative treatment is very effective in these patients, there are still a lot of operations performed, mainly bypasses, interventional dilatations or stenting. The examples of some typical courses out of more than 64,000 vascular disease patients treated in the Hochrheinklinik during the last 24 years point out a new possibility taking a wrong way in treatment decisions. The structure of the new German DRGs stimulates to carry out interventions and operations as there is a great enhancement in earnings. These may result not only in a rise of costs but in a higher risk for patients, too.","1006":"Percutaneous transluminal angioplasty (PTA) is a well-established technique in the treatment of symptomatic femoropopliteal artery stenoses and obstructions. It is a method of treatment with excellent initial technical and clinical results. However, the long-term results of PTA alone must be considered as unsatisfactory as recurrences are frequently observed. In the past, femoropopliteal stenting appeared to be a promising tool to prevent recurrence and to increase patency rates, but it did not produce better results than PTA alone. For this reason, alternative therapeutic strategies such as brachytherapy, drug-eluting pharmastents and gene therapy were developed. Several investigators are beginning to explore their potential use. This article reviews the present possibilities of PTA and stenting in the femoropopliteal region and considers potential future concepts. In this context, the current clinical literature is discussed.","1007":"The percutaneous transluminal angioplasty of stenosis and short occlusions of the femoral artery is a well established, safe and effective treatment option. The additional placement of stents during angioplasty is associated with frequent and rapid restenosis due to intimal hyperplasia. Therefore, stent placement of the femoral artery is commonly recommended only for special circumstances, including PTA-induced dissection of the vessel wall, elastic recoil, and eccentric stenosis. Placement of stents near joints, e. g. in the common femoral artery or the popliteal artery should be avoided as it may lead to structural damage of the stents. The current angiological statement concerning stent implantation in the femoral artery may be revised if effective measures to inhibit intimal hyperplasia such as brachytherapy or sirolimus coated stents become available.","1008":"We demonstrate patients to reveal the conditions for good results with respect to acute and long term out-come of interventional therapy of iliac artery occlusion. 225 Patients with aortoiliacal occlusion who underwent surgery or intervention were evaluated. All patients were discussed in an interdisciplinary angiologic conference. 63 patients primary had an operation, 161 patients primary were treated by intervention. The two cohorts were compared concerning their structure, the primary success and the primary and secondary patency over one year. Both cohorts showed significant differences, the surgical treated patient had a higher clinical stage as well as more complex iliacal occlusion. The interventional treated patients had higher comorbidity. Primary technical success and patency rates did not show any difference. The complication rate was equally low in both cohorts. In percutaneous treated patients after predilatation, embolization into the periphery occurred. With primary stent PTA, there was no embolization. The percutaneous recanalization also of long iliac occlusion is a save, successful alternative to surgery. Nevertheless, there are limits. For optimal therapy management an interdisciplinary consultation is necessary. To avoid embolization, after recanalization primary stent PTA should be performed. ","1009":"The occurrence of cerebral or retinal ischemic symptoms ipsilateral to high-grade internal carotid artery (ICA) stenosis indicates a status of instability with a substantial risk for future major stroke. Additionally, the detection of microembolic signals downstream of ICA stenosis is predictive for future cerebral ischemia in asymptomatic and symptomatic patients. There is substantial evidence that in unstable ICA stenosis plaque rupture and thrombus formation are the most frequent pathoanatomic findings. In contrast, in nearly the half of unstable carotid plaques the lumen surface appears to be intact. Within plaque tissue, the unstable plaque is mainly characterized by a substantial amount of inflammatory cell (i. e. macrophages, T-cells) infiltration. These cells are mainly localized in the fibrous cap near the necrotic core. Produced by macrophages, matrix degrading enzymes (e. g. MMP-9) are overexpressed in the unstable ICA stenosis. Thrombogenicity is mainly determined by the local concentration of activated tissue factor, also expressed by inflammatory cells. Furthermore, a significantly higher rate of apoptotic smooth muscle cells can be found within the fibrous cap of instable carotid stenoses. Whether infection with Chlamydia pneumoniae contribute to instability is unlikely, because a positive association to clinical instability has not been shown up to now. The exact and detailed characterization of the unstable ICA plaque and the correlation of different biological mechanisms to clinical instability may offer the possibility to use it as a human model of unstable atherosclerosis in general and to test the efficacy of new developed anti-atherosclerotic pharmaceutical agents.","1010":"AIM, METHODS, PATIENTS: In a prospective interdisciplinary study of 468 carotid artery stenoses we compared the ultrasound plaque morphology with the histological diagnosis. For detection of soft plaques and hard plaques by preoperative ultrasound examination we found a sensitivity of 80%. The accuracy for the estimation of the degree of the stenosis was 98%. In case of stroke in progression and completed stroke we found ulcerations by histological examination in 72%. By ultra-sound these ulcerations were detected only in 53%. We found a significant higher figure for TIA and stroke in soft plaque patients than in asymptomatic stage, in which hard plaque formation was seen more often. Patients with a soft plaque seem to have a higher risk of a postoperative permanent neurological deficit. However, the dangerous plaque formation with thrombosis or ulceration was not be detected with appropriate accuracy. Therefore the risk of embolisation cannot be predicted sufficiently by means of duplex scanning. This would be extremely important for the indication for stenting in this area. The number of HITS (high intensity transient signals) is 8 to 20 times higher in carotid stenting. ","1011":"Systemic thrombolysis with rt-PA within 3 hours after symptom onset has developed into a standard therapy for acute stroke patients. Recombinant t-PA is now licensed in Europe for this indication. Within 3 to 6 hours, no general therapeutic standard has been established yet. Currently, the available data are in favor of intra-arterial thrombolysis for patients with proximal occlusions of the middle cerebral artery. Systemic thrombolysis is not generally recommended in this time window, but is used in some centers for selected patients. In addition to thrombolysis and new strategies to improve thrombolysis (including patient selection with MRI), several interventional and surgical recanalization techniques are discussed.","1012":"","1013":"","1014":"There is now convincing evidence that a high level of coagulation factor VIII is an important risk factor for venous thromboembolism. A factor VIII plasma concentration above 1500 IU\/l is associated with an almost 5-fold risk for a first episode of venous thrombosis. In thrombosis patients high factor VIII has been shown to persist over time and is not related to an acute phase reaction. High factor VIII is also an important risk factor for recurrence of venous thrombosis. In a prospective cohort study factor VIII levels exceeding the 90th percentile of the patient population conferred an almost 7-fold risk of recurrent venous thrombosis. The pathomechanisms leading to venous thrombosis in patients with high factor VIII are still unclear. In many patients, however, a biochemically detectable hypercoagulable state (as represented by elevated levels of the coagulation activation marker prothrombin thrombin fragment F1.2) was demonstrated. The optimal duration of secondary thromboprophylaxis for patients with high factor VIII levels is uncertain. We currently perform an interventional trial comparing conventional to extended anticoagulation. Reduction of factor VIII by administration of a non-selective ss-receptor blocker might be a promising therapeutic concept which is currently under investigation.","1015":"For the study presented here 135 pediatric PUP patients with haemophilia consecutively admitted to German pediatric haemophilia treatment centers were investigated. In addition to factor VIII activity, the factor V (FV) G1691A mutation, the factor II (FII) G20210A variant, methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) T677T genotype, elevated lipoprotein a (Lp a), antithrombin, protein C, and protein S were investigated. 103 out of 122 HA patients (FVIII activity &lt;1%) were suffering from severe HA. The prevalence of prothrombotic risk factors in children with severe haemophilia A (HA) did not differ from previously reported data: FV GA 5.8%, FII GA 3.9%, MTHFR TT 10%, elevated Lp a 7%, protein C type I deficiency 1.1%. The first symptomatic bleeding leading to diagnosis of severe haemophilia occurred with a median age of 1.6 years (range: 0.5-7.1 years) in children carrying prothrombotic risk factors compared to non-carriers (0.9 years (0.1-4.0; p = 0.01). Two patients presenting with neonatal stroke due to elevated Lp a and the FII GA variant showed haemorrhagic stroke transformation triggered by severe haemophilia. In addition, when haemophilia A was corrected by administration of factor VIII concentrates eight out of 25 children with central lines in place developed catheter-related thrombosis. The data of this multicentre cohort study demonstrate that the clinical phenotype of severe haemophilia A in childhood is clearly influenced by the coinheritance of prothrombotic risk factors. ","1016":"The acquired haemophilia is caused by formation of autoantibodies which are most frequently directed against factor VIII (FVIII). This disease associated with considerable morbidity as well as mortality occurs preferentially in the elderly. The antibodies lead to a loss of FVIII activity resulting in bleeds especially of soft or subcutaneous tissue or in muscles. aPTT prolongation and the reduction of the factor activity are of diagnostic importance. However, with respect to bleeding tendency basal activity and inhibitor titre are less meaningful than in inherited haemophilia complicated by inhibitor formation. Therapy is subdivided into treatment of acute bleeds and long-term eradication of the inhibitor. Administration of recombinant FVIIa, high dosed FVIII or activated prothrombin complex concentrates represent approved treatment options of bleeding episodes. Immunosuppressive agents occasionally combined with FVIII administration or immunoadsorption may lead to long-term inhibitor eradication. As CD4(+) T cells as well as anti-idiotypic antibodies appear to be increasingly pathogenetically meaningful new immunomodulating agents might improve the treatment of acquired haemophilia. ","1017":"Haemophilia A is caused by a genetic defect of the factor VIII gene resulting in complete or considerable functional loss of factor VIII molecule within blood. The high bleeding risk of patients can be prevented by intravenous injections of factor VIII protein. However, 25% of patients affected with severe haemophilia, develop factor VIII antibodies against the concentrate substituted. Within this study we try to comprise the phenotypic parameters (e. g. detailed documentation of disease course, basic laboratory values) and the therapy-associated data (e. g. applicated type and amount of factor VIII, number of substitutions, factor VIII recovery, inhibitor development and inhibitor elimination). We hope to identify differences of variable therapeutic treatments on course of disease as already identified for the factor VIII gene defects. At least we expect that certain mutations and mutation types, respectively, can be referred to typical phenotypes and similar course of treatment protocols.","1018":"The Committee of Haemophilia of the GTH has established a central registry for all German centers treating patients with haemophilia. The intention was to establish a suitable system for collecting and analyzing epidemiological data relevant to bleeding disorders. The registry provides the database within the scope of the German Human-Genome-Project. The set goal is the complete molecular characterization of the genetic mutations on chromosome X of haemophilia A patients in Germany and subsequent correlation with the phenotype. An electronic network is applied for communication. A Java-application was developed for online electronic data acquirement by the participating centers. Offline data entry and sending encrypted data carriers is possible, too. A high level of security is assured by personalized access. Data are anonymized and scrambled by secure encoding. The concept was confirmed by the official data security offices. A considerable improvement for the epidemiological sciences and a better basis on therapy for patients with bleeding disorders is expected. Furthermore the registry is available for other scientific projects.","1019":"Approximately 30% of patients suffering from severe haemophilia A develop antibodies against factor VIII (FVIII) neutralizing the effect of the pro-coagulant activity of intravenously injected FVIII as a complication of replacement therapy. Generally, various epitopes on the FVIII molecule are bound by these antibodies. The detailed structure of such epitopes is unknown. In this study epitopes on the FVIII molecule are identified using solid phase bound peptide arrays carrying the whole amino acid sequence of FVIII as small oligopeptides. The binding of FVIII antibodies by specific peptide sequences on the array indicates potential epitopes. FVIII antibodies of inhibitor patients and healthy blood donors are currently investigated by this method. Identified epitopes may lead to new concepts in therapy aiming at avoidance of inhibitor formation or improvement of inhibitor eradication. As participant of the 'haemophilia A' consortium dealing with genotype\/phenotype correlation in haemophilia A we investigate, if the site or type of the mutation correlates with the epitopes, and if there is any relation between epitopes and clinical course. Furthermore, the influence of epitopes on therapeutical effects and the outcome of immune tolerance induction is under scrutiny.","1020":"Haemophilia A represents the most frequent hereditary bleeding disorder in humans. The disease is caused by mutations within the factor VIII gene leading to decreased or absent factor VIII activities with a bleeding tendency depending on the degree of factor VIII deficiency. Nowadays, the causative mutations can be routinely detected and have substantially improved diagnostic and understanding of the pathophysiology of haemophilia A. Identification of the gene defects in haemophilic families have enabled fast and save carrier diagnosis. The correlation of the genetic defects with the clinical course revealed that the type of mutation represents the most important genetic predisposing factor for inhibitor formation, the most severe complication of treatment with factor VIII concentrates. Mitigated clinical courses of haemophilia A were shown to be due to special types of mutations or the presence of concomitant thrombophilic mutations. Molecular models of the factor VIII protein allowed to investigate the effects of specific mutations thus giving new insights in the structure\/function relationship of the factor VIII molecule. These findings might promote the development of novel recombinant factor VIII concentrates with higher efficacy, longer half life and reduced immunogenicity.","1021":"","1022":"In Germany, approximately 6,000 patients are suffering from haemophilia A. Screening methods cover 97% of the mutations. For the other patients the coding sequences of the FVIII gene have to be sequenced in total. Out of 1,350 patients, no mutation was observed in 80 patients. In 5 patients, we observed an inversion in intron 1. Known mutations were detected in 16 patients, and in 19 cases novel mutations were characterized (14 in coding regions and 5 in flanking introns). The mutations are mainly base pair substitutions, small deletions or insertions (max. 4 bp) and predicted to cause amino acid exchanges or frameshifts leading to premature stop codons. Moreover, 5 polymorphisms were identified in exons 14 and 26 as well as in introns 7 and 19. Further studies are necessary to identify their causative effects. Surprisingly, in 23 patients out of this subgroup of 80, no mutation was identified in the FVIII gene. Therefore, mutations in non-coding areas or even in other genes have to be considered responsible for the haemophilia A like phenotype. One of them codes for the von Willebrand factor (vWF). We confirmed in two of our cases mutations in the vWF gene.","1023":"Platelets and the coagulation system cannot be regarded as completely separate systems. Both systems become activated upon vessel injury and multiple functional interactions exist. Thus with a combination therapy with anticoagulants and platelet-active drugs, drug interactions relevant for hemostasis must be expected. This includes a synergistic inhibition of the hemostatic system but also possible synergistic effects on bleeding complications. This concise review discusses the clinical efficacy of a combination therapy with anticoagulants and platelet-active drugs in patients with acute coronary syndromes (unstable angina, myocardial infarction).","1024":"Vascular catheters are the most important cause of thromboembolism in neonates. Additionally, a concomittant genetic predisposition with the well-known mutations is often present. In order to understand the pathology, knowledge about the specific condition of the newborn is important, especially concerning the altered hemostatic balance. For indications the specific situation of the very small infant is to be considered, e. g. the increased risk of cerebral bleeding in the first days of life of prematures. Therefore, careful consideration of indication and contraindications is mandatory. To avoid catheter-related thrombosis different schedules of prophylaxis are well-tried, especially low dose heparinization (sometimes as continuous infusion) is recommended for different types of vascular access. In neonates specific organ-related complications of umbilical catheters are to be considered. For the early diagnosis of catheter-related thrombosis, attention should be given to its first signs. Thrombolytic therapy is worth to be considered. However, the state of the patient and the dynamic of thrombus growth must be taken into account.","1025":"Infections and thromboses are the most frequent complications of central venous catheters (cvc). The use of a special material (i. e. polyurethane, silicone) and type (i. e. Hickman) small in diameter, the avoidance of any infection as well as the optimal position of the cvc tip in the lower part of the vena cava superior and a short period of catheterisation will be effective in decreasing the number of thromboses, whereas other thrombogenic factors (i. e. malignant disease), the patient's age, additional chemo- and\/ or radiotherapy cannot practically be influenced. Coated cvc, oral anticoagulants, acetylsalicylic acid, and low dose urokinase, unfractionated and predominantly low molecular weight heparins (LMWH) are in use to avoid thromboses. Our outpatients with progressed gastrointestinal malignancies, port systems, and systemic chemotherapy consequently receive a prophylaxis with LMWH for at least 90 days according to the beneficial results published in three studies. Additional antitumoral effects of LMWH are presently evaluated and will favour consequent LMWH prophylaxis in patients with advanced malignancies and permanent catheters.","1026":"The clinical diagnosis of superficial thrombophlebitis is characterized by the occurrence of painful and inflamed cords along superficial veins and varices. Duplex sonography is recommended to rule out asymptomatic deep vein thrombosis which may be present in about 20% and to check potential sources of entrance of the thrombotic process into deep veins, like the junctions of great and small saphenous veins. Classic therapy is based on firm compression therapy and walking exercises. Incisions with expression of clots and anti-inflammatory drugs may reduce pain and inflammation. When phlebitis involves also the thigh and especially the proximal part of the great saphenous vein surgical ligation of the junction and local thrombectomy can be considered, preferably on an outpatient basis. Recent data from one randomised controlled trial demonstrate the efficacy of unfractionated heparin in a dose of 12,500 I.U. s. c. twice a day in this indication. According to another randomised controlled trial low molecular weight heparin (LMWH) may reduce the development of thromboembolic complications and also the relatively frequent extension of the thrombi in the superficial veins. Therapeutic doses seem to be more effective than prophylactic doses. While conventional therapy with compression and walking is sufficient for the majority of cases, the additional use of low molecular heparin is recommended in increased thromboembolic risk and when the thigh is involved. In the few studies available treatment time of 6-12 days is reported. More studies with special focus on indication, dosage and duration of therapy with LMWH are needed for the recommendation of clear therapeutic guidelines.","1027":"Superficial thrombophlebitis is a frequently occurring disease which, because of risk factors, affects women to a greater extent than men. The presence of deep venous thrombosis should be excluded by imaging procedures. Heparin or low-molecular weight heparins are indicated for treatment, if deep venous thrombosis is present or threatening. In the acute stage non-steroidal antiinflammatory drugs can be taken orally in order to alleviate pain and inflammation. In the case of concomitant chronic venous insufficiency, edema protective drugs (e. g. preparations containing horse chestnut extract and flavonoids) can support the therapy. For the treatment of inflammatory conditions in relatively short superficial vein segments without involvement of the deep venous system, a limitation to topical treatment is possible. In addition to compression therapy, the application of creams or gels containing heparin or heparinoids are the usual treatment approach. The use of topical products containing mucopolysaccharide polysulfate (MPS) has been proven to be beneficial. The problem of providing evidence of the efficacy of topical products in the therapy for superficial thrombophlebitis under the current strict demands of our regulatory authorities and of developing new products under these conditions is discussed.","1028":"Among the antithrombotic therapies evaluated to date, the synthetic peptide bivalirudin is unique in its ability to reduce both ischemic and bleeding complications associated with percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). Bivalirudin is a small peptide consisting of 20 amino acid residues that binds thrombin in a direct, reversible, and bivalent fashion. The agent is approved for use in the United States and New Zealand as an anticoagulant in patients with unstable angina undergoing PCI and may also prove beneficial in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS), acute myocardial infarction (AMI) and in patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft (CABG) procedures. This article examines bivalirudin in more detail.","1029":"Argatroban is the smallest anticoagulant molecule of direct thrombin inhibitors. The main attributes of this synthetic drug are its rapid onset of anti-thrombin action, the rapid reversibility of its anticoagulant effect, potent inhibition of clot-bound thrombin, the absence of antibody formation and no need for dosage adjustment in patients with renal impairment. It is eliminated by hepatic metabolism. These properties make argatroban a predictable anticoagulant with intravenous use in a routine clinical setting. Argatroban is approved in the US and Canada for both prophylaxis and treatment of thrombosis in patients with heparin-induced throm-bocytopenia (HIT) and in the US as an antithrombotic agent during percutaneous coronary interventions in patients with HIT or a history of HIT. Preliminary reports document the feasibility of using argatroban for anticoagulation during hemodialysis and as adjunct to thrombolysis for treatment of myocardial infarction. Current recommendations for argatroban monitoring are to use the aPTT (activated partial thromboplastin time) for low doses and the ACT (activated clotting time) for high doses. The specific inhibition of thrombin can be measured with the ECT (ecarin clotting time).","1030":"Approved indications for the recombinant hirudins lepirudin (Refludan(R)) und desirudin (Revasc(R)) are therapy of heparin-induced thrombocytopenia (HIT) and thrombosis prophylaxis following knee or hip replacement surgery. Kidney function dependent pharmacokinetics and their capability of inducing antibodies directed against hirudin are characteristic of this class of drugs. However, close dose-monitoring allows safe and effective use of both compounds. While lepirudin is used widely, besides danaparoid, for treatment of HIT, desirudin has not yet been widely accepted for thrombosis prophylaxis following knee or hip replacement surgery.","1031":"By the use of conventional anticoagulants, significant improvements were achieved in all fields of medicine. Although efficacious and widely used, their use is limited in several respects. In particular, the use of vitamin K antagonists is restricted in the clinical routine setting. The main reasons are the delayed on- and off-set of action, the narrow therapeutic window, the necessity of individual laboratory-controlled dosing, and interactions with food ingredients and drugs. The search for new antithrombotics with an improved safety\/efficacy profile led to the development of the direct oral thrombin-inhibitor ximelagatran. It can be administered without routine monitoring of coagulation parameters and does not possess any of the previously mentioned limitations. The results from clinical phase II studies obtained so far are very encouraging. After completion of the clinical development program focussing on prevention and treatment of venous thromboembolism, on stroke prevention in atrial fibrillation and on acute coronary syndromes, it is desirable to continue with investigations with regard to long-term prophylaxis in high risk surgery, in chronic peripheral artery disease, in patients with left ventricular thrombi, artificial heart valves, or thrombophilia, as an alternative anticoagulant in heparin induced thrombocytopenia and for prevention of thromboembolic complications in oncology. Because of the mitogenic effects of thrombin on the proliferation of tumour cells, additional experimental studies aiming at a potential inhibition of thrombin-triggered oncogenesis is of uttermost interest.","1032":"Lone atrial fibrillation is a major health problem for elderly patients with cardiovascular risk factors as hypertension, congestive heart failure or previous myocardial infarction. The increased stroke rate of these patients is significantly reduced by oral anticoagulation (target: INR 2-3) and less effective by acetylsalicylic acid at a dose of 325 mg\/d. As an alternative to the vitamin K-antagonistic anticoagulants currently the SPORTIF trial program is performed investigating the safety and efficacy of the oral direct thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran. Recent data derived from a dose-finding study and its open label continuous follow-up period are very encouraging with regard to the low incidence of bleeding complications and ximelagatran's clinical efficacy for the prevention of thromboembolic events. Large confirmatory trials engaging about 3000 patients each are under way in Europe as an open-label trial and the United Staates as a double blind trial. Results are being expected for the end of year 2002. These data will clarify the role of ximelagatran for the prevention of thromboembolic events in patients with lone atrial fibrillation and may give us an insight into a new standard drug regimen for stroke prevention in high risk patients.","1033":"Acute venous thromboembolism including asymptomatic and symptomatic pulmonary embolism without respiratory or cardiac failure is currently treated for 6 months, initially with subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin followed by oral anticoagulation. The main drawback of oral anticoagulation is caused by severe bleeding complications. Oral Ximelagatran has shown to be as effective and safe for the initial treatment of acute deep venous thrombosis compared to subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin followed by oral warfarin over a period of 4 weeks. Currently, oral ximelagatran is investigated versus subcutaneous low-molecular-weight heparin and oral warfarin over 6 months to demonstrate an almost equal efficacy and safety. The study is performed on a double blind and double dummy basis. Six months after oral anticoagulation of patients with acute deep venous thrombosis, recurrent venous thromboembolism may occur in up to 25% within 2 years. Ximelagatran is currently investigated versus placebo to demonstrate a reduced recurrence rate of venous thromboembolism over a period of 18 months.","1034":"The efficacy and safety of the new oral, direct and selective thrombin inhibitor Ximelagatran and its active form Melagatran was analysed in patients undergoing total hip or knee replacement. Methro II, a randomised, double-blind controlled dose-finding study, involved 1876 patients. Melagatran (1, 1.5, 2.25 or 3 mg; twice daily; start: immediately before surgery) was given subcutaneously, followed by orally administered Ximelagatran (8, 12, 18 or 24 mg, twice daily, day after surgery) and compared to subcutaneously administered dalteparin (5000 IE, once daily). Methro III was a randomised, double blind controlled study involving 2788 patients. The fixed dose of 3 mg Melagatran was given (start: 4-12 hours postoperatively) followed by oral Ximelagatran (24 mg, twice daily, day after surgery) compared to subcutaneous enoxaparin (40 mg, once daily). In both studies, dalteparin or enoxaparin was applied at the evening before operation; the treatment lasted 8 to 11 days. A bilateral venography was performed at the last day of treatment. In the Methro II study, 1270 patients underwent total hip, 606 total knee replacement. In both groups the thromboembolism rate was reduced depending on the dose of Ximelagatran\/Melagatran. Compared to dalteparin, it was significantly lower for the Ximelagatran\/Melagatran group with the highest dose. In the Methro III study 1923 patients underwent a total hip, 865 a total knee replacement. The thromboembolism rate was 31% for the Ximelagatran\/Melagatran group compared to 27% for the enoxaparin group. In both studies blood loss and transfusion requirement were in the same range as with low weight molecular heparins. A fixed subcutaneously given dose of Melagatran, followed by orally administered Ximelagatran is effective and well tolerated as prophylaxis against venous thromboembolism. ","1035":"Because of its central role in the coagulation cascade thrombin is an attractive target for its inhibition. Many limitations of conventional anticoagulants have been eliminated by the development of the direct oral thrombin inhibitor ximelagatran. Thus, this compound may fulfil the criteria of an ideal anticoagulant. The antithrombotic efficacy and safety of this inhibitor is presently studied in a large clinical development program.","1036":"Direct thrombin inhibitors are in focus of interest for hereditary or acquired thrombophilic indications. Besides thrombosis prophylaxis in surgery, life-threatening cardiac diseases and stroke are of special interest for this new drug class. For long-term prophylaxis of genetically caused thrombophilia the only drug class currently available are the orally active dicoumarol derivatives. Their application is a time and cost intensive procedure and associated with side effects, too. Active site-directed inhibitors block the catalytic triad of the active centre of thrombin responsible for hydrolytic cleavage. Inhibitor ratios (K(j)) are in the nanomolar or picomolar range. As these substances are eliminated via liver or kidneys with an elimination half-life of 0.3-2 hours, parenteral administration should be used for acute therapy and prophylaxis. For long-term prophylaxis, orally absorbable derivatives of these direct thrombin inhibitors are available with absorption rates of 10-30%. They are converted into their parent substance in blood. Therapeutical range is relatively large so that an oral long-term prophylaxis using standard dose is possible without monitoring. The first representative of this new drug class, Ximelagatran, an orally absorbable variant of Melagatran, is currently undergoing phase III trials for different indications. Using oral administration of two partial doses per day, a good compliance is expected.","1037":"","1038":"In addition to those wounds with increasing fragility of capillaries during impaired healing, there are especially long lasting diabetic wounds or calf ulcerations due to chronic venous insufficiency or postthrombotic syndrome that show a failure of endothelial barrier function with an increased permeability as an important part of its pathophysiological situation. The possibility of controlling this increased permeability is of great therapeutical interest and may give distinct benefit for wound healing. In the close past, clinical as well as experimental studies revealed the plasma transglutaminase (factor XIIIa) as potential new strategy in treatment of increased vascular permeability.","1039":"In the final step of the clotting cascade coagulation factor XIII (FXIII) is activated by thrombin. The activated enzyme (FXIIIa) has an important role in the final stage of blood coagulation in cross-linking soluble fibrin to a stable insoluble clot. The role of FXIII in cardio- and cerebrovascular diseases has been investigated recently. The widespread Val34Leu polymorphism in the gene coding for the FXIII subunit A (FXIII Val34Leu) has been shown to protect against myocardial infarction and ischemic stroke, but is also associated with an increased risk for hemorrhagic stroke. Additionally, FXIII Val34Leu is supposed to be protective against pulmonary embolism and deep vein thrombosis. As possible mechanisms for the antithrombotic effect, premature depletion of the mutant protein from circulation and altered fibrin structures of clots cross-linked by the mutant FXIIIa are under discussion. The connection between FXIII and the insulin resistance syndrome also attracts attention, i.e. the interaction between a component of the coagulation cascade and thus a thrombotic risk factor and classical atheromatous risk factors. Therefore, FXIII must be considered as another coagulation factor contributing to complex interactions between genes and environment important for the pathogenesis of cardio- and cerebrovascular and thromboembolic diseases.","1040":"Severe homozygous factor XIII deficiency was first described in Switzerland, in 1961. At present 14 patients are known here. Nine are of Swiss origin, the others are immigrants from eastern Europe. A 27-year-old woman with many haemorrhages during childhood immigrated to Switzerland and went through four episodes of haemorrhagic corpus luteum cyst rupture with life-threatening blood loss into the abdomen and three haemorrhages into the retroperitoneal muscles causing sensomotoric palsies, before the diagnosis was established. A monthly prophylactic replacement therapy of 500 IE factor XIII concentrate was started. Since then no signs of haemorrhage occurred. For the last trimester of pregnancy treatment intervals were shortened and dosage increased. Haemorrhage from the umbilical cord for weeks, subcutaneous haematomas, intracranial haemorrhage, muscle haemorrhage and wound bleeding with impaired wound healing as well as tendency to marked scar formation are characteristic for severe homozygous factor XIII deficiency. Without replacement therapy women suffer from obligate abortion. Diagnosis is made by the solubility of fibrin clots in urea (5 mol\/l) or monochloroacetic acid (1-2%). For confirmation and monitoring of replacement therapy a quantitative incorporation assay is used. Replacement therapy is necessary in case of haemorrhage, injury, and surgery. Because of the high risk of intracranial haemorrhage prophylaxis is strongly recommended.","1041":"Factor XIIIa (FXIIIa) catalyzes the covalent crosslinking of fibrin polymers and incorporation of proteins into the fibrin network and thus confers on the thrombus additional structural stability and relative resistance to plasmin-mediated degradation. Moreover, FXIIIa is involved in other physiological and pathophysiological processes such as wound healing and arteriosclerosis. Selective FXIIIa inhibitors may be a valuable tool for evaluation of the various functions of FXIIIa and their pharmacological control. This paper presents an overview of the inhibitors of FXIIIa. Analogues of natural FXIIIa substrates - including glutamine containing peptides and low molecular weight substituted alkylamines - are incorporated into the fibrin network and thus prevent crosslinking of fibrin. Naturally occurring, direct inhibitors of FXIIIa have been isolated from a leech species and microorganisms. With effective concentrations in the nanomolar range the peptide tridegin is the most potent FXIIIa inhibitor up to now. The majority of the synthetic, low molecular Weight inhibitors bind covalently to Cys314 at the active site of FXIIIa. Besides the relatively nonspecific thiol reagents, azol derivatives, azolium salts and related substances are described as specific inhibitors of FXIIIa. They inhibit the activity of FXIIIa at nanomolar concentrations. Animal experiments have demonstrated improved thrombolysis by a plasminogen activator in combination with a FXIIIa inhibitor.","1042":"Activated factor XIII (FXIIIa) plays an important role in the final stage of the coagulation cascade by covalent crosslinking of fibrin strands. As a transglutaminase FXIIIa catalyses the generation of intermolecular amide bonds between lysine and glutamine residues resulting in a complex three-dimensional clot structure. Enhanced clot stability is supported by covalent binding of cytosceleton factors like actin and myosin. Moreover, the clot is protected against premature lysis by the incorporation of fibrinolysis inhibitors like alpha(2)-antiplasmin and thrombin activatable fibrinolysis inhibitor (TAFI). A covalent crosslinking of the fibrin strands with extra-cellular matrix proteins like fibronectin, vitronectin, collagen and von Willebrand factor (vWF) immobilizes the clot at the site of injury. Moreover FXIII supports the healing process of damaged tissue. In this review assays for determination of FXIIIa activity, FXIII concentration and identification of the FXIIIVal34Leu polymorphism are shown.","1043":"Activated factor XIII (FXIIIa) crosslinks fibrin monomers to a stable clot. Due to this function, FXIIIa plays a major role in hemostasis and fibrinolysis. Additionally, it is well known that FXIIIa has a special meaning in cell adhesion and migration, in generation of extracellular matrix, in tissue repair and wound healing. New experimental studies revealed a FXIIIa stabilizing endothelial barrier function. In this function, FXIIIa reduces endothelial permeability for macromolecules in cultured endothelial monolayers and prevents impending barrier failure in coronary arteries of isolated hearts. This effect is due to the cross-linking of several proteins within the extracellular matrix, especially in the interendothelial clefts.","1044":"For a long time blood coagulation factor XIII did not get the attention it deserves, and research in the field of transglutaminases was neglected. The interesting results obtained in recent years demonstrate the importance of this protein for the stabilization of a blood clot. The accurate regulation of activation and of localization of factor XIII is not fully understood. Yet the proposed mechanisms suggest a high degree of complexity. In this review, recent biochemical and structural results on factor XIII are discussed.","1045":"Activated by calcium and thrombin, factor XIII (FXIIIa) cross-links fibrin, thus increasing the stability of the fibrin clot. Furthermore, the hemostatic and reparative function of factor XIIIa is mediated by cross-linking other proteins like alpha(2)-plasmin-inhibitor, fibronectin, and collagen. The FXIII Val34Leu polymorphism plays a role in athero- and thrombogenesis. FXIII deficiency is an autosomal recessive disorder. The most common symptom is the bleeding tendency of the umbilical cord some days after birth. The diagnosis is confirmed by a solubility clot test in urea (5 mol\/l) and then differentiated with an incorporation assay and immuno-electrophoresis. The bleeding tendency typically becomes obvious when FXIIIa activity is &lt;1-2%. Severe bleeding episodes, however, may even occur with FXIIIa activities of 30-50%, especially in heterozygous persons. The sometimes life-threatening bleeding tendency of the inherited FXIII deficiency can be treated with FXIII concentrates. Acquired FXIII deficiency occurs in several internal diseases and after major surgery. The clinical significance is not completely clear. Moreover, FXIII is applied locally as a component of fibrin glues.","1046":"","1047":"A high \"loading dosage\" is often given during initiation of oral anticoagulant treatment in order to reach sufficient anticoagulation within short time. Increased bleeding risk as well as a transient prothrombotic tendency are complications of this treatment schedule. The aim of our study was to find proper dosage regimens of phenprocoumon and warfarin allowing initiation of oral anticoagulant treatment in a short time. For 50% of the patients 7.5 mg warfarin daily resulted in stable INR values within 4 days. Patients receiving higher (10 mg) or lower (5 mg) daily dosages of warfarin or 6 or 9 mg phenprocoumon daily during the first days of therapy reached the therapeutic range significantly later. Furthermore, no significant differences of prothrombin fragment F 1+2 were observed, indicating that no enhanced thrombin formation occurred. Thus, initiation of oral anticoagulant treatment using 7.5 mg warfarin daily is a simple and safe dosage regimen.","1048":"Successful treatment of deep vein thrombosis by lysis therapy leads to recanalisation of the occluded vessel saving the venous flaps, thus limiting postthrombotic syndrome. Systemic lysis therapy carries an increased risk of fatal complications (1-2%). However, loco-regional lysis therapy with rtPA stands out as a method of recanalisation without increased complications compared to compression and anticoagulation therapy. According to the leading opinion about systemic lysis therapy it should only be performed if thrombotic age does not exceed 10 days. In this study we examined whether loco-regional lysis therapy is successful with older thrombosis, too. We showed that in thromboses older than 10 days lysis success was slightly decreased whereas postthrombotic syndrome doubled (up to 50%). These results point out loco-regional lysis as a method suitable for thromboses with age up to 10 days only.","1049":"In the final step of blood coagulation, fibrin monomers polymerize spontaneously and are covalently linked by factor XIIIa. Mutations in one of the three genes coding for the fibrinogen peptides may disturb this process and lead to diseases such as afibrinogenemia or dysfibrinogenemia, or may even cause hereditary renal amyloidosis. In the brief overview presented here we summarize some of the molecular aspects of these diseases.","1050":"","1051":"","1052":"Recent progress in molecular biology enabled the elucidation of the nucleotide sequences of the genes for antithrombin III (AT III), protein C (PROC) and protein S (PROS). Furthermore numerous mutations were identified causing genetic defects of the important inhibitors of blood coagulation. As the genes for AT III (13.8 kb) and PROC (11.2 kb) are small and easy to analyze a great number of molecular defects already are described in extensive databases (50, 73): 79 different mutations for AT III and 160 for PROC are included. The identification of mutations leading to AT III and PROC deficiency has given important information on the structure-function relationships of the proteins. In case of protein C deficiency the clinical relevance of DNA analyses is most important because the diagnosis at the protein level is often uncertain. The gene for PROS is not so easy to analyze like the other two genes. The PROS gene is large and also a PROS pseudogene exists. Although a number of mutations have been identified, there has not been published a database until now. The clinical relevance to identify gene defects in PROS deficiency is as important as for PROC deficiency. Presumably the elucidation of PROS gene defects will advance in the near future.","1053":"","1054":"","1055":""},"articletitle":{"0":"","1":"GTH News.","2":"New Anticoagulants in Neonates, Children,
